Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

The objective of this discussion and analysis is to allow investors to view the company from management’s perspective. Accordingly, we provide the reader with narrative context for how our management views our consolidated financial statements, additional context within which to assess our operating results, and information on the quality and variability of our earnings, liquidity and cash flows. The discussion that follows is primarily focused on 2020 versus 2019 results. Discussion and analysis of 2019 results compared to 2018 is included under item 7., “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020.

The Year in Review 

We prepare financial statements and present financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments and present financial results on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as Core Earnings. We provide this Core Earnings basis of presentation on a consolidated basis and for each business segment because this is what we review internally when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also include this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our Core Earnings basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide certain Core Earnings disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures — Core Earnings” for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and Core Earnings.  

2020 GAAP net income was $412 million ($2.12 diluted earnings per share), compared with $597 million ($2.56 diluted earnings per share) in the prior year. See “Results of Operations – Comparison of 2020 Results with 2019” for a discussion of the primary contributors to the change in GAAP earnings between periods.  

2020 Core Earnings(1) net income was $631 million ($3.24 diluted Core Earnings per share), compared with $607 million ($2.60 diluted Core Earnings per share) for 2019. Full-year 2020 and 2019 adjusted diluted Core Earnings(1) per share were $3.40 and $2.64, respectively. See “Segment Results” for a discussion of the primary contributors to the change in Core Earnings between periods.

Navient’s Response to COVID-19 

The World Health Organization first declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 13, 2020 by which time the economic impact of the crisis was beginning to take hold, impacting the global economy and our results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic was subsequently declared a national emergency. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local, and foreign governments have put in place quarantines, executive orders, shelter-in-place orders, and similar government orders and restrictions in order to control the spread of the disease. Such orders or restrictions have resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions, and cancellation or postponement of events. They have also resulted in a general decline in economic activity and consumer confidence and increases in job losses and unemployment. While certain COVID-19 vaccines have recently been approved and have become available for use in the United States, we are unable to predict when those vaccines will become widely available, how widely utilized the vaccines will be, whether they will be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19, and when or if normal economic activity and business operations will resume. In this section, we will highlight our response to the global pandemic and its continuing impact on our business and operations. While we have experience in managing our business through economic crises in the past, there is a substantial amount of uncertainty associated with this crisis. We suggest that the information below should be read in conjunction with our risk factors included in “Risk Factors — The Impact of COVID-19 and Related Risk” in this 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Our Team Members 

As this crisis evolved, we took early action to protect the health and safety of our employees. We expanded our work-from-home capabilities and implemented best practices in our facilities with regard to safety and hygiene to protect those who were unable to work remotely. We were able to quickly and successfully enable 90% of our team to work from home. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 85% of our team remains on work-from-home status. As a result of these steps, the pandemic has not adversely affected our ability to maintain our operations or service our customers and borrowers. We currently anticipate that some of our team members will begin returning to the office on a limited basis in the future. As we plan for the return to office process, it is likely to take place in stages and we anticipate that the environment will require a continuation of various safety protocols that are already in place including requiring the use of face coverings and distancing.  

Customers and Education Loan Performance 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law. In compliance with the CARES Act and through subsequent legislative and executive actions, we have been instructed to place all loans owned by ED into forbearance and suspend payments and interest accrual until September 30, 2021. While the CARES Act applies only to loans owned by ED, our FFELP and Private Education Loan portfolios have also been impacted by the pandemic and we have offered COVID-19 relief options such as the use of forbearance to those borrowers. Private Education Loans in forbearance decreased to $844 million or 3.9% of the portfolio at December 31, 2020, after peaking at $3.4 billion or 14.7% during the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 forbearance granted to borrowers. This compared to $604 million or 2.7% of the portfolio at December 31, 2019. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, we have seen most borrowers continue to make payments according to their payment plans. And while forbearance rates have risen, the balance of loans delinquent has declined – our Private Education Loan delinquency rate declined from 4.6% at December 31, 2019 to 2.6% as of December 31, 2020. This decline in the delinquency rate is partially due to the increased granting of forbearance discussed above. Our Private Education Loan charge-offs declined 49% to $184 million in 2020 compared with $364 million in 2019. This decline was due to the strength of the economy heading into March 2020 as well as a result of the COVID-19 forbearance granted to borrowers. Defaults in both our Private Education Loan and FFELP Loan portfolios were significantly lower in 2020 than 2019 as well as lower than what had been expected at the start of the year primarily as a result of the increased use of payment relief options. Total provision for loan losses in 2020 was $155 million which was primarily due to an increase in expected losses related to COVID-19. The provision in 2020 primarily relates to increases in defaults as a result of COVID-19 that we expect to occur in 2021 and 2022 given the default timing impact from the use of forbearances. Our total reserves were $1.86 billion (excluding the expected future recoveries on charged-off loans) at December 31, 2020 which represent reserves equal to 7.1% of our Private Education Loans and 0.05% of our FFELP Loan portfolio. These reserve levels cover future expected defaults of approximately 18% in our FFELP portfolio and approximately 12% in our legacy private (non-refinance loan) portfolio. While we are paying close attention to the needs of our customers, it is too early to know the full impact of this crisis or the path and timing of the recovery. 

In the first quarter of 2020, our Private Education Refinance Loan originations of $1.9 billion represented a 92% increase over the year-ago quarter. While demand continued to be very strong for our products, beginning in March, we reduced our marketing efforts and tightened credit until we had greater visibility into the uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets and the overall economic outlook. This resulted in second-quarter originations of $238 million. With improved visibility in both credit and funding costs, we restarted marketing efforts in the third quarter and increased third-quarter and fourth-quarter originations to $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion of loans, respectively. Total originations were $4.6 billion in 2020 compared to $4.9 billion in 2019. We expect 2021 originations to be higher than 2020 if the economy continues to improve.  

12 

Clients and Business Processing Segment Performance 

In our Business Processing Segment (BPS), 2020 EBITDA(1) increased 16% to $57 million from $49 million a year ago. This increase is a result of being able to transition hundreds of our experienced BPS colleagues to support state clients working to help residents access unemployment benefits implemented in the CARES Act, as well as to perform contact tracing and vaccine administration services. These new services generated revenue in the second half of 2020 that more than offset the negative revenue impact BPS is experiencing as a result of COVID-19 which includes significantly lower transaction-related placements in both government services and health care revenue cycle management. In 2021, we expect the revenue from the unemployment contracts related to the CARES Act and contact tracing contracts to decline as the economy recovers and the need decreases. We also expect revenue from the core parts of the business to continue to improve to pre COVID-19 levels if the economy continues to improve. 

Liquidity, Financings and Capital 

The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the capital markets was significant during the early part of the crisis, decreasing the number of transactions brought to market and increasing the pricing of those that were successfully marketed. However, in the second half of 2020 the capital markets began to improve with ready access to the markets, albeit at a higher cost than pre COVID-19 levels. From April 2020 to December 2020 we issued $6.0 billion of term ABS, extended a FFELP Loan ABCP facility to 2022, extended a Private Education Loan facility to 2021 and expanded the total capacity in our Private Education Refinance Loan ABCP facility from $2 billion to $2.6 billion. Looking forward, while the cost of financing may be elevated, it has decreased from the second-quarter 2020 peak, and we believe that the ABS and unsecured debt markets remain a viable source of funding. In January and February 2021, we issued $500 million of unsecured debt and $1.8 billion of ABS at or near pre COVID-19 cost of funds. Throughout the crisis we have maintained a strong liquidity position. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.7 billion of primary sources of liquidity, $1.2 billion of which was cash. We also had, as of December 31, 2020, additional capacity in our funding facilities of $2.2 billion for Private Education Loans and $506 million for FFELP Loans. In addition, cash flow from our loan portfolio and services contracts remains strong and was greater than our original forecast for 2020 as our very seasoned loan portfolio experiences lower levels of stress. 

We ended the year with an Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio(1) of 5.0%. The decline in our Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio(1) from 7.6% as of December 31, 2019 is partially attributable to implementing CECL which, as expected, reduced our capital levels. We expect our capital levels to continue to rebuild over the course of 2021. In addition, our GAAP equity was reduced in 2020 as a result of the net mark-to-market losses related to derivative accounting recognized under GAAP that cumulatively totaled $616 million (after tax) as of December 31, 2020. This decrease will reverse over time as these derivatives mature. The resulting Pro forma Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio(1), which excludes these cumulative mark-to-market losses, was 7.1% at December 31, 2020. 

Other Matters 

From an accounting, reporting and disclosure perspective, COVID-19 and the related work-from-home policies did not negatively impact our ability to close our books, manage our financial systems, or maintain our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for a discussion of how COVID-19 impacted our allowance for loan loss and our conclusion of goodwill not being impaired. 

We have successfully implemented our business continuity plans in response to COVID-19. We do not foresee requiring material expenditures to continue to operate in a work-from-home environment nor do we expect material expenditures to return to work in the office. We do not anticipate a material adverse impact of COVID-19 on our supply chain and we do not expect the anticipated impact of COVID-19 to materially change the relationship between costs and revenues. We have not been adversely impacted by travel restrictions and border closures nor do we anticipate that our operations will be materially impacted by any constraints on our human capital resources and productivity.

Results of Operations  

GAAP Income Statements  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

14 

Comparison of 2020 Results with 2019  

For the year ended December 31, 2020, net income was $412 million, or $2.12 diluted earnings per common share, compared with net income of $597 million, or $2.56 diluted earnings per common share, for the year-ago period.  

The primary contributors to the change in net income compared to 2019 are as follows:  

•  

Net interest income increased by $67 million, primarily as a result of a favorable interest rate environment and the growth in the Private Education Refinance Loan portfolio, which was partially offset by the continued natural paydown of the FFELP and non-refinance Private Education Loan portfolios.  

•  

Provisions for loan losses decreased $103 million:  

○   

The provision for FFELP loan losses decreased $17 million to $13 million in 2020.  

○   

The provision for Private Education Loan losses decreased $86 million to $142 million in 2020.  

The provision in 2020 is primarily related to an increase in expected losses due to COVID 19’s negative impact on current and forecasted economic conditions. This provision directly related to changes in the following assumptions regarding the current and forecasted economic conditions since the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020: an increase in unemployment, a decrease in GDP, a decrease in interest rates, an increase in consumer loan delinquency rates and a decrease in consumer income. CECL requires the allowance for loan losses to cover remaining current expected credit losses in the portfolio. Prior to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the allowance for loan losses was an incurred loss model. See “Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies” for a discussion of the CECL methodology as well as the adoption and impact of CECL on January 1, 2020 and a discussion of the methodology prior to CECL. 

•  

Asset recovery and business processing revenue decreased $30 million primarily as a result of the wind-down of the ED asset recovery contract in the Federal Education Loan segment and the impact of COVID-19 on certain collection and processing activities. This was partially offset by $96 million of revenue earned in our Business Processing segment from contracts to support states in providing unemployment benefits and contact tracing services.  

•  

Gains on sales of loans decreased $16 million, due to the $16 million gain on sale of $412 million of Private Education Refinance Loans in the year-ago period. There were no loan sales in the current period.  

•  

Net gains on debt repurchases decreased by $51 million. We repurchased $768 million of debt at a $6 million loss in the current period compared to $1.2 billion repurchased at a $45 million gain in the year-ago period.  

•  

Net gains on derivative and hedging activities decreased $278 million. The primary factors affecting the change were interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, which impact the valuations of derivative instruments including Floor Income Contracts, basis swaps and foreign currency hedges during each period. Valuations of derivative instruments fluctuate based upon many factors including changes in interest rates, credit risk, foreign currency fluctuations and other market factors. As a result, net gains and losses on derivative and hedging activities may vary significantly in future periods.  

•  

Excluding net regulatory-related costs of $33 million and $6 million, respectively, operating expenses were $931 million and $978 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This $47 million decrease was primarily a result of an $82 million decrease in expenses in the Federal Education Loan and Consumer Lending segments as a result of the decrease of Federal Education Loan asset recovery revenue discussed above as well as improvements in operating efficiencies. The remaining $35 million increase is primarily in the Business Processing segment in connection with a $46 million increase in segment revenue. Regulatory-related expenses in the years ended December 2020 and 2019 are net of $10 million and $30 million, respectively, of insurance reimbursements for costs related to such matters.  

•  

Acquired intangible asset impairment and amortization expense decreased $8 million primarily as the result of the notice of termination of a contract in our government services reporting unit in the year-ago period which resulted in $4 million of impairment on the related intangible asset.  

•  

During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred $9 million and $6 million, respectively, of restructuring/other reorganization expenses in connection with an effort to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency. These charges were primarily due to facility lease terminations and severance-related costs.  

We repurchased 30.6 million and 34.5 million shares of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result of repurchases, our average outstanding diluted shares decreased by 38 million common shares (or 16%) from the year-ago period.

Other Segment  

The following table presents Core Earnings results for our Other segment.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net Interest Loss after Provision for Loan Losses  

Net interest loss after provision for loan losses is due to the negative carrying cost of our corporate liquidity portfolio. The decrease in the net interest loss is primarily a result of a decrease in the cost of funds of the debt funding the corporate liquidity portfolio.  

Gains (Losses) on Debt Repurchases 

We repurchased $768 million and $1.2 billion of unsecured debt in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Debt repurchase activity will fluctuate based on market fundamentals and our liability management strategy.  

Unallocated Shared Services Expenses  

Unallocated shared services expenses are comprised of costs primarily related to information technology costs related to infrastructure and operations, stock-based compensation expense, accounting, finance, legal, compliance and risk management, regulatory-related expenses, human resources, certain executive management and the board of directors. Regulatory-related expenses include actual settlement amounts as well as third-party professional fees we incur in connection with such regulatory matters and are presented net of any insurance reimbursements for covered costs related to such matters. On an adjusted basis, expenses decreased $4 million from the prior year. Adjusted expenses exclude $33 million and $6 million, respectively, of regulatory-related expenses in 2020 and 2019, which are net of $10 million and $30 million, respectively, of insurance reimbursements for covered costs related to such matters.  

See “Note 12 – Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees” for a discussion of legal and regulatory matters where it is reasonably possible that a loss contingency exists. The Company is unable to anticipate the timing of a resolution or the impact that these matters may have on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, results of operation or cash flows. As a result, it is not possible at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any, for amounts that may be payable in connection with these matters and reserves have not been established. It is possible that an adverse ruling or rulings may have a material adverse impact on the Company.  

Restructuring/Other Reorganization Expenses  

During 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred $9 million and $6 million, respectively, of restructuring/other reorganization expenses in connection with an effort to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency. The charges were due primarily to facility lease terminations and severance-related costs.

Allowance for Loan Losses  

See “Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies” for discussion of the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, and the related transition adjustment. The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan losses during 2020: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

In 2020, the portion of the loan amount charged off at default on Private Education Loans increased from 81% to 81.4%. This charge resulted in a $23 million reduction to the balance of the expected future recoveries on charged-off loans.  

(2)   

Charge-offs are reported net of expected recoveries. For Private Education Loans, at the time of charge-off, the expected recovery amount is transferred from the education loan balance to the allowance for loan loss and is referred to as the “expected future recoveries on charged-off loans.” For FFELP Loans, the recovery is received at the time of charge-off.  

(3)   

At the end of each month, for Private Education Loans that are 212 or more days past due, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance. Actual recoveries are applied against the remaining loan balance that was not charged off. We refer to this as the expected future recoveries on charged-off loans. If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected, the difference is immediately charged off through the allowance for Private Education Loan losses with an offsetting reduction in the expected future recoveries for charged-off loans. If actual periodic recoveries are greater than expected, they will be reflected as a recovery through the allowance for Private Education Loan losses once the cumulative recovery amount exceeds the cumulative amount originally expected to be recovered. The following table summarizes the activity in the expected future recoveries on charged-off loans: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(4)  

The allowance used for these metrics excludes the expected future recoveries on charged-off loans to better reflect the current expected credit losses remaining in the portfolio. 

27 

The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the year-ago periods. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   

In 2019 and 2018, the portion of the loan amount charged off at default on our Private Education Loans increased from 80.5% to 81% and from 79% to 80.5%, respectively. These changes resulted in a $21 million and $32 million reduction to the balance of the receivable for partially charged-off loans in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

 (2)   

Charge-offs are reported net of expected recoveries. For Private Education Loans, the expected recovery amount is transferred to the receivable for partially charged-off loan balance. Charge-offs include charge-offs against the receivable for partially charged-off loans which represents the difference between what was expected to be collected and any shortfalls in what was actually collected in the period. The table below summarizes the activity in the Private Education Loan receivable for partially charged-off loans. For FFELP Loans, the recovery is received at the time of charge-off.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Funding and Liquidity Risk Management  

The following “Liquidity and Capital Resources” discussion concentrates primarily on our Federal Education Loans and Consumer Lending segments. Our Business Processing and Other segments require minimal liquidity and funding. See “Navient’s Response to COVID-19” for a discussion of COVID-19’s impact on liquidity and capital resources. 

We define liquidity as cash and high-quality liquid assets that we can use to meet our cash requirements. Our two primary liquidity needs are: (1) servicing our debt and (2) our ongoing ability to meet our cash needs for running the operations of our businesses (including derivative collateral requirements) throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. Secondary liquidity needs, which can be adjusted as needed, include the origination of Private Education Loans, acquisitions of Private Education Loan and FFELP Loan portfolios, acquisitions of companies, the payment of common stock dividends and the repurchase of our common stock. To achieve these objectives, we analyze and monitor our liquidity needs and maintain excess liquidity and access to diverse funding sources including the issuance of unsecured debt and the issuance of secured debt primarily through asset-backed securitizations and/or other financing facilities.  

We define our liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our obligations when they become due without incurring unacceptable losses or to invest in future asset growth and business operations at reasonable market rates. Our primary liquidity risk relates to our ability to service our debt, meet our other business obligations and to continue to grow our business. The ability to access the capital markets is impacted by general market and economic conditions, our credit ratings, as well as the overall availability of funding sources in the marketplace. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter derivatives.  

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and may change, from time to time, based on our financial performance, industry and market dynamics and other factors. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include the ratings agencies’ assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position and capital management practices. A negative change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity because it might raise the cost and availability of funding and potentially require additional cash collateral or restrict cash currently held as collateral on existing borrowings or derivative collateral arrangements. It is our objective to improve our credit ratings so that we can continue to efficiently access the capital markets even in difficult economic and market conditions. We have unsecured debt totaling $8.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Three credit rating agencies currently rate our long-term unsecured debt at below investment grade.  

We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the repayment of $0.7 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature in the short term (i.e., over the next 12 months) and the remaining $7.7 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature in the long term (from 2022 to 2043 with 85% maturing by 2029), primarily through our current cash, investments and unencumbered FFELP Loan and Private Education Refinance Loan portfolios (see “Sources of Liquidity” below), the predictable operating cash flows provided by operating activities ($987 million in 2020), the repayment of principal on unencumbered education loan assets, and the distribution of overcollateralization from our securitization trusts. We may also, depending on market conditions and availability, draw down on our secured FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan facilities, issue term ABS, enter into additional Private Education Loan ABS repurchase facilities, or issue additional unsecured debt.  

We originate Private Education Loans. We also have purchased and may purchase, in future periods, Private Education Loan and FFELP Loan portfolios from third parties. Those originations and purchases are part of our ongoing liquidity needs. We purchased 30.6 million shares of common stock for $400 million in 2020. We had $600 million of remaining share repurchase authority as of December 31, 2020. 

29 

Sources of Liquidity  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Liquidity may also be available under our secured credit facilities. Maximum borrowing capacity under the FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) facilities will vary and be subject to each agreement’s borrowing conditions, including, among others, facility size, current usage and availability of qualifying collateral from unencumbered loans. The following tables detail these facilities with maturity dates ranging from June 2021 to April 2022. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2020, we had a total of $5.4 billion of unencumbered tangible assets inclusive of those listed in the table above as sources of primary liquidity. Total unencumbered education loans comprised $2.6 billion of our unencumbered tangible assets of which $2.4 billion and $0.2 billion related to Private Education Loans and FFELP Loans, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had $6.0 billion of encumbered net assets (i.e., overcollateralization) in our various financing facilities (consolidated variable interest entities). Since the fourth quarter of 2015, we have closed on $4.3 billion of Private Education Loan ABS repurchase facilities with $1.2 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2020. These repurchase facilities are collateralized by Residual Interests in previously issued Private Education Loan ABS trusts. These repurchase facilities are collateralized by Residual Interests in previously issued Private Education Loan ABS trusts. These are examples of how we can effectively finance previously encumbered assets to generate additional liquidity in addition to the unencumbered assets we traditionally have encumbered in the past. Additionally, these repurchase facilities had a cost of funds lower than that of a new unsecured debt issuance.  

The following table reconciles encumbered and unencumbered assets and their net impact on total Tangible Equity.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). “Note 2 — Significant Accounting Policies” includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates its estimates, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical accounting estimates involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of our operations. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are the allowance for loan losses, goodwill, and premium and discount amortization. As part of the discussion below, we have described how COVID-19 impacted the allowance for loan losses as well as how COVID-19 was considered in our assessment of goodwill impairment.  

31 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

On January 1, 2020 we adopted CECL. See “Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies” for a discussion of our accounting policy under CECL and the related transition adjustment as of the January 1, 2020 adoption.  

We have determined that, for modeling current expected credit losses, in general, we can reasonably estimate expected losses that incorporate current and forecasted economic conditions over a “reasonable and supportable” period. For Private Education Loans, we incorporate a reasonable and supportable forecast of various macro-economic variables over the remaining life of the loans. The development of the reasonable and supportable forecast incorporates an assumption that each macro-economic variable will revert to a long-term expectation starting in years 2-4 of the forecast and largely completing within the first five years of the forecast. For FFELP Loans, after a three-year reasonable and supportable period, there is an immediate reversion to a long-term expectation.  

The models used to project losses utilize key credit quality indicators of the loan portfolios and predict how those attributes are expected to perform in connection with the forecasted economic conditions. In connection with this methodology, our modeling of current expected credit losses utilizes historical loan repayment experience since 2008 identifying loan variables (key credit quality indicators) that are significantly predictive of loans that will default and predicts how loans will perform in connection with the forecasted economic conditions.  

The key credit quality indicators used by the model for Private Education loans are credit scores (FICO scores), loan status, loan seasoning, whether a loan is a TDR, the existence of a cosigner and school type: 

•  

Credit scores are an indicator of the credit risk of a customer and the higher the credit score the more likely it is the customer will be able to make all of their contractual payments.  

•  

Loan status affects the credit risk because a past due loan is more likely to default than an up-to-date loan. Additionally, loans in a deferred payment status have different credit risk profiles compared with those in current payment status.  

•  

Of the portfolio in repayment, loan seasoning affects credit risk because a loan with a history of making payments generally has a lower incidence of default than a loan with a history of making infrequent or no payments.  

•  

A TDR loan is where an economic concession (forbearance, lower interest rate, extension of term) has been given to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. A TDR loan is generally more likely to result in a default than a non-TDR loan. 

•  

The existence of a cosigner generally lowers the likelihood of default, thus lowering the credit risk.  

•  

The type of school customers attend can have an impact on their graduation rate and job prospects after graduation and therefore affects their ability to make payments, which impacts the credit risk.  

For FFELP loans, the key credit quality indicators are loan status and loan type (Stafford, Consolidation and Rehab loans).  

We project losses over the contractual term of our loans, including any extension options within the control of the borrower. Further, we make estimates regarding prepayments when determining our expected credit losses which are derived in the same manner discussed above. 

The forecasted economic conditions used in our modeling of expected losses are provided by a third party. The primary economic metrics we use in the economic forecast are unemployment, GDP, interest rates, consumer loan delinquency rates and consumer income. Several forecast scenarios are provided which represent the baseline economic expectations as well as favorable and adverse scenarios. We analyze and evaluate the alternative scenarios for reasonableness and determine the appropriate weighting of these alternative scenarios based upon the current economic conditions and our view of the likelihood and risks of the alternative scenarios.  

We use historical customer payment experience to estimate the amount of future recoveries on defaulted private education loans. We use judgment in determining whether historical performance is representative of what we expect to collect in the future. The expected future recoveries on defaulted FFELP loans is based on the contractual government guarantee (which generally limits the maximum loss to 3% of the loan balance). 

Once our loss model calculations are performed, we review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determine if qualitative adjustments need to be made. These adjustments may include, but are not limited to, changes in lending, servicing and collection policies and practices as well as the effect of other external factors such as the economy and changes in legal or regulatory requirements that impact the amount of future credit losses. 

The $155 million provision for loan losses in 2020 primarily related to an increase in expected losses due to COVID-19’s negative impact on the current and forecasted economic conditions (see “Navient’s Response to COVID-19” for further discussion of COVID-19). This increase in expected losses was largely reflected in the allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2020 as we believe there was not a significant change in the credit quality of the portfolio or in  

32 

the current and forecasted economic conditions between June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020. These conclusions and adjustments were based on an evaluation of current and forecasted economic conditions directly taking into consideration the negative impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy. We evaluated and considered several forecasted economic scenarios when making these conclusions and adjustments. We also considered the characteristics of our loan portfolio and its expected behavior in the forecasted economic scenarios. The provision for loan losses in 2020 related to COVID-19 is directly related to changes in the following assumptions regarding the current and forecasted economic conditions since January 1, 2020 (when CECL was implemented): an increase in unemployment, a decrease in GDP, a decrease in interest rates, an increase in consumer loan delinquency rates and a decrease in consumer income. If future economic conditions as a result of COVID-19 are significantly worse than what was assumed as a part of this assessment, specifically related to the severity and length of the downturn and subsequent recovery, it could result in additional provision for loan loss being recorded in future periods. 

The evaluation of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates and assumptions that may be susceptible to significant changes. If actual future performance in delinquency, charge-offs and recoveries are significantly different than estimated, or management’s assumptions or practices were to change, this could materially affect our estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses on our income statement. 

Goodwill 

In determining annually (or more frequently if required) whether goodwill is impaired, we complete a goodwill impairment analysis which may be a qualitative or a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances associated with the reporting unit. Qualitative factors considered in conjunction with a qualitative analysis include: (1) the amount of cushion that existed the last time a quantitative test was completed which requires performing a valuation of the reporting unit the resulting value of which is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, (2) macroeconomic factors (economy), (3) industry specific factors (growth or deterioration of the market; regulatory/political developments), (4) cost factors (margins), (5) financial performance of the reporting unit itself, (6) other specific items (litigation, change in management or key personnel) and (7) whether a sustained decrease in our share price is indicative of a decline in value of the specific reporting unit. There can be significant judgment involved in assessing these qualitative factors. If, based on a qualitative analysis, we determine it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we also complete a quantitative impairment analysis. In lieu of performing a qualitative assessment, we may proceed directly to a quantitative impairment analysis. A quantitative goodwill impairment analysis requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value (the amount we believe a third party would pay for such reporting unit), the goodwill associated with the reporting unit will be impaired in an amount equal to the difference between the reporting unit’s fair value and its carrying value not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill attributed to the reporting unit. There are significant judgments involved in determining the fair value of a reporting unit, including determining the appropriate valuation approach or approaches to utilize and the assumptions to apply including estimates of projected future cash flows which incorporate estimated future revenues, expenses, net income and capital expenditures from and related to existing and new business activities and appropriate market multiples, discount rates and growth rates. An appropriate resulting control premium is also considered. The reporting units with goodwill for which we estimate fair value are not publicly traded and for some reporting units directly comparable market data may not be available to aid in its valuation.  

Navient tests goodwill as of October 1 each year or at interim dates if an event occurs or circumstances exist such that it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value (the qualitative test). Such an event or circumstance is a triggering event. If it is concluded that a triggering event has occurred at an interim date, a quantitative impairment test must be performed. Beginning in the latter half of the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 created significant disruption in the U.S. economy (see “Navient’s Response to COVID-19” for further discussion of COVID-19). In addition to COVID-19 causing a significant decline in Navient’s stock price, restrictions aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing, impacted macroeconomic conditions. Such macroeconomic conditions impacted our reporting units with goodwill, the industry and markets in which these reporting units operate, their cost structures and, to some degree, their expected 2020 financial performance. As a result, we assessed whether a triggering event occurred as of September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020 in addition to performing annual impairment testing as of October 1, 2020. 

As part of the triggering event assessments for each reporting unit and annual impairment testing for our FFELP Loans, Private Education Loans-Legacy, Private Education Refinance Loans and Federal Education Loan Servicing reporting units, we assessed relevant qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of an individual reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We considered the amount of excess fair values over the carrying values of each reporting unit as of October 1, 2019 when we last performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The concluded fair values of the reporting units at October 1, 2019 were substantially in excess of their carrying amounts. Additionally, fair values resulting from sensitivity analyses factoring in more conservative discount rates and growth rates for each reporting unit also yielded fair values in excess of the carrying values of each reporting unit.  

33 

Despite COVID-19, the outlook and associated long-term cash flow projections of our FFELP Loans, Private Education Loans-Legacy, and Federal Education Loan Servicing reporting units have not changed significantly since our 2019 assessment. For the Private Education Refinance Loans reporting unit, we considered origination volume and the demand for its refinance loan products as well as Navient’s strong liquidity position and ability to issue Private Education Loan ABS comprised entirely of the reporting unit’s refinance loans albeit at a higher cost of funds. Based on the substantial fair value determined as of October 1, 2019 in excess of their carrying values and these other qualitative factors, we concluded that it is not “more-likely-than-not” that the fair values of these reporting units were less than their carrying values at October 1, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020. As a result, with respect to annual impairment testing, we concluded that goodwill attributed to these reporting units was not impaired. With respect to the quarterly assessments, we concluded that COVID-19 and its impact on Navient’s individual reporting units as we perceived them did not constitute a triggering event during 2020. 

For Government and Healthcare Services, the quarterly triggering event assessments considered the substantial fair values determined in conjunction with 2019 annual impairment testing in excess of the carrying values of these reporting units as well as the short and long-term outlook for these businesses which experienced the temporary stoppage of certain collection and processing activity and lower volume in the transportation business as a result of COVID-19. No contracts for either reporting unit have been terminated due to COVID-19, and significant additional contracts were acquired in 2020 to implement programs under the CARES Act and perform contact tracing services. The revenue from these new contracts more than offset the decline in other revenue due to COVID-19 during 2020. Based on these qualitative factors, with respect to the quarterly assessments, we concluded that it was not “more-likely-than-not” that the fair values of these individual reporting units were less than their carrying values, and as a result, we concluded that COVID-19 and its impact on these reporting units did not constitute a triggering event.  

As of October 1, 2020, we performed a quantitative annual impairment test for both Government and Healthcare Services. We determined the fair value of these reporting units and concluded these reporting units were not impaired as the resulting fair values of the reporting units were substantially greater than their respective carrying values. We determined the fair values by using three different valuation approaches that were weighted appropriately by reporting unit: (1) a discounted cashflow approach using market discount rates and long term growth rates (2) a market multiples approach that applied revenue and EBITDA market multiples determined based on multiples for similar publicly traded companies to the respective revenue and EBITDA measures of these reporting units and (3) a comparable transactions approach pursuant to which value was derived based on the selling price of similar publicly-traded companies. Based on the quantitative tests for these reporting units, we determined that their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values indicating that the goodwill attributed to these reporting units is not impaired.  

If future economic conditions as a result of COVID-19 are significantly worse than what was assumed in the reporting units’ long term cash flow projections specifically related to the severity and length of the downturn and subsequent recovery and other performance factors do not come to fruition, these factors could result in potential impairment of goodwill in future periods. 

Premium and Discount Amortization  

The Company had a net unamortized premium balance of $22 million, or 0.03%, in connection with its $81 billion education loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. The most judgmental estimate for premium and discount amortization on education loans is the Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR), which measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay down principal compared to their stated terms. In determining the CPR we only consider payments made in excess of contractually required payments. This would include loans that are refinanced, consolidated and other early payoff activity. These activities are generally affected by changes in our business strategy, changes in our competitors’ business strategies, legislative changes including the ability to consolidate, interest rates and changes to the current economic and credit environment. When we determine the CPR we begin with historical prepayment rates. We make judgments about which historical period to start with and then make further judgments about whether that historical experience is representative of future expectations and whether additional adjustment may be needed to those historical prepayment rates.  

In the past (prior to 2008), the consolidation of FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans significantly affected our CPRs and updating those assumptions often resulted in material adjustments to our premium and discount amortization expense. As a result of the passage of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA), there is no longer the ability to consolidate loans under the FFELP although there are other consolidation options with ED and private refinancing options with Navient and other lenders. As a result, we expect CPRs related to our FFELP Loans to remain relatively stable over time, unless there is a legislative change by ED or by Congress to either (1) forgive loan balances (which would result in Navient receiving cash for the amounts forgiven resulting in a prepayment of principal) or (2) encourage or force consolidation. Some education loan companies, including Navient, offer Private Education Loans to refinance a borrower’s loan (both FFELP and Private Education Loans) and we anticipate more entrants to offer similar products. These products and expectations are built into the CPR assumption we use for FFELP and Private Education Loans. However, it is difficult to accurately project the timing and level at which this activity will continue and our assumption may need to be updated by a material amount in the future based on changes in the economy, marketplace and legislation.  

34 

In 2020 there was a net $6 million increase in net interest income due to a cumulative adjustment related to an increase in prepayment speed assumptions used to amortize loan premiums and discounts. The FFELP Stafford Loan CPR assumption was increased from 8% to 9%, the FFELP Consolidation Loan CPR assumption was increased from 4% to 5% and the Private Education Loan CPR assumption was increased from 9% to 11%. These CPR assumption increases were primarily a result of increased voluntary payoffs primarily due to increased loan refinance activity and third-party consolidation activity related to the decrease in interest rates that occurred in 2020.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In addition to financial results reported on a GAAP basis, Navient also provides certain performance measures which are non-GAAP financial measures. We present the following non-GAAP financial measures: (1) Core Earnings, (2) Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio and (3) EBITDA for the Business Processing segment. 

1. Core Earnings 

We prepare financial statements and present financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments and present financial results on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as Core Earnings. We provide this Core Earnings basis of presentation on a consolidated basis and for each business segment because this is what we review internally when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our Core Earnings basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide certain Core Earnings disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments.  

Core Earnings are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use Core Earnings to manage our business segments because Core Earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for two items, discussed below, that can create significant volatility mostly due to timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that Core Earnings provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business plan or against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information because we believe it provides investors with additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. When compared to GAAP results, the two items we remove to result in our Core Earnings presentations are:  

(1)  

Mark-to-market gains/losses resulting from our use of derivative instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness; and  

(2)  

The accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets.  

While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our Core Earnings basis of presentation does not. Core Earnings are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our Core Earnings presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance with that of other financial services companies based upon Core Earnings. Core Earnings results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, our board of directors, credit rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance.

The following tables show Core Earnings for each reportable segment and our business as a whole along with the adjustments made to the income/expense items to reconcile the amounts to our reported GAAP results as required by GAAP and reported in “Note 15 — Segment Reporting.”

The following discussion summarizes the differences between Core Earnings and GAAP net income and details each specific adjustment required to reconcile our Core Earnings segment presentation to our GAAP earnings.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Derivative Accounting: Core Earnings exclude periodic gains and losses that are caused by the mark-to-market valuations on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under GAAP, as well as the periodic mark-to-market gains and losses that are a result of ineffectiveness recognized related to effective hedges under GAAP. Under GAAP, for our derivatives that are held to maturity, the mark-to-market gain or loss over the life of the contract will equal $0 except for Floor Income Contracts, where the mark-to-market gain will equal the amount for which we originally sold the contract. In our Core Earnings presentation, we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any net settlement cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an interest expense or revenue over the hedged item’s life. 

The accounting for derivatives requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings, with no fair value adjustment of the hedged item, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The gains and losses recorded in “Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net” and interest expense (for qualifying fair value hedges) are primarily caused by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate and foreign currency risk management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, basis swaps and at times, certain other LIBOR swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and the stand-alone derivative is adjusted to fair value in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item.  

Our Floor Income Contracts are written options that must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness. Specifically, our Floor Income Contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the pay down of principal of the education loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those education loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income Contracts. Additionally, the term, the interest rate index, and the interest rate index reset frequency of the Floor Income Contract can be different than that of the education loans. Under derivative accounting treatment, the upfront contractual payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract. The change in the fair value of Floor Income Contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of Floor Income paid to the counterparties to vary. This is economically offset by the change in the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying education loans but that offsetting change in fair value is not recognized. We believe the Floor Income Contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of Floor Income earned over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on Floor Income for that period. Therefore, for purposes of Core Earnings, we have removed the mark-to-market gains and losses related to these contracts and added back the amortization of the net contractual premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts. The amortization of the net contractual premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts for Core Earnings is reflected in education loan interest income. Under GAAP accounting, the premiums received on the Floor Income Contracts are recorded as revenue in the “gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net” line item by the end of the contracts’ lives.  

39 

Basis swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one floating interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to hedge our education loan assets that are primarily indexed to LIBOR or Prime. The accounting for derivatives requires that when using basis swaps, the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk; however, they generally do not meet this effectiveness test because the index of the swap does not exactly match the index of the hedged assets as required for hedge accounting treatment. Additionally, some of our FFELP Loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates and therefore swaps economically hedging these FFELP Loans do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, under GAAP, these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected currently in the income statement.  

The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting between GAAP and Core Earnings net income.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Derivative accounting requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives that do not qualify as hedges to be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. Under our Core Earnings presentation, these settlements are reclassified to the income statement line item of the economically hedged item. For our Core Earnings net interest income, this would primarily include (a) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to our Floor Income Contracts to education loan interest income and (b) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to certain of our interest rate swaps to debt interest expense. The table below summarizes these net settlements on derivative and hedging activities and the associated reclassification on a Core Earnings basis. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“Mark-to-market gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net” is comprised of the following:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(3)  

Other derivative accounting adjustments consist of adjustments related to: (1) foreign currency denominated debt that is adjusted to spot foreign exchange rates for GAAP where such adjustments are reversed for Core Earnings and (2) certain terminated derivatives that did not receive hedge accounting treatment under GAAP but were economic hedges under Core Earnings and, as a result, such gains or losses are amortized into Core Earnings over the life of the hedged item.  

40 

Cumulative Impact of Derivative Accounting under GAAP compared to Core Earnings  

As of December 31, 2020, derivative accounting has decreased GAAP equity by approximately $616 million as a result of cumulative net mark-to-market losses (after tax) recognized under GAAP, but not in Core Earnings. The following table rolls forward the cumulative impact to GAAP equity due to these after-tax mark-to-market net gains and losses related to derivative accounting.

Hedging Embedded Floor Income  

Net Floor premiums received on Floor Income Contracts that have not been amortized into Core Earnings as of the respective period-ends are presented in the table below. These net premiums will be recognized in Core Earnings in future periods. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining term of the Floor Income Contracts was approximately 3 years. Historically, we have sold Floor Income Contracts on a periodic basis and depending upon market conditions and pricing, we may enter into additional Floor Income Contracts in the future. The balance of unamortized Floor Income Contracts will increase as we sell new contracts and decline due to the amortization of existing contracts.  

In addition to using Floor Income Contracts, we also use pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the embedded Floor Income within FFELP Loans. These interest rate swaps qualify as GAAP hedges and are accounted for as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt. For GAAP, gains and losses on these hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Hedged Floor Income from these cash flow hedges that has not been recognized into Core Earnings and GAAP as of the respective period-ends is presented in the table below. This hedged Floor Income will be recognized in Core Earnings and GAAP in future periods and is presented net of tax. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining term of these pay-fixed interest rate swaps was approximately 6 years. Historically, we have used pay-fixed interest rate swaps on a periodic basis to hedge embedded Floor Income and depending upon market conditions and pricing, we may enter into swaps in the future. The balance of unrecognized hedged Floor Income will increase as we enter into new swaps and decline as revenue is recognized.

Of the $401 million as of December 31, 2020, approximately $172 million, $113 million and $84 million will be recognized as part of Core Earnings in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  

 (2) Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets: Our Core Earnings exclude goodwill and intangible asset impairment and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The following table summarizes the goodwill and acquired intangible asset adjustments.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Adjusted Core Earnings 

Adjusted Core Earnings net income excludes restructuring and regulatory-related expenses. Management excludes these expenses as it is one of the measures we review internally when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources, as this presentation is a useful basis for management and investors to further analyze Core Earnings. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. 

The following table summarizes these expenses which are excluded: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2. Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio 

Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio measures the ratio of Navient’s Tangible Equity to its tangible assets. We adjust this ratio to exclude the assets and equity associated with our FFELP portfolio because FFELP Loans are no longer originated and the FFELP portfolio bears a 3% maximum loss exposure under the terms of the federal guaranty. Management believes that excluding this portfolio from the ratio enhances its usefulness to investors. Management uses this ratio, in addition to other metrics, for analysis and decision making related to capital allocation decisions. The Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio is calculated as: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

The following provides a pro forma of what the Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio would be if the cumulative net mark-to-market losses related to derivative accounting under GAAP were excluded. These cumulative losses reverse to $0 upon the maturity of the individual derivative instruments. As these losses are temporary, we believe this pro forma presentation is a useful basis for management and investors to further analyze the Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio.

3. Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization Expense (EBITDA) 

This measures the operating performance of the Business Processing segment and is used by management and equity investors to monitor operating performance and determine the value of those businesses. EBITDA for the Business Processing segment is calculated as:

Risk Management  

Our Approach  

Navient’s identification, understanding and effective management of the risks inherent in our business are critical to our continued success. We assign risk oversight, management and assessment responsibilities at various levels within our organization and continuously coordinate these activities. We maintain comprehensive risk management practices to identify, measure, monitor, evaluate, control and report on our significant risks and we routinely evaluate these practices to determine whether they are functioning properly and can be improved.  

Risk Management Philosophy  

Navient’s risk management philosophy is to ensure all significant risks inherent in our business are identified, measured, monitored, evaluated, controlled and reported. In furtherance of these goals, Navient 

•  

maintains a comprehensive and uniform risk management framework;  

•  

follows a “three lines of defense” structure based upon: (1) accountability and ownership at the business area level for risks inherent in their activities (first line of defense); (2) supporting areas, such as Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, Finance and Accounting, Information Technology and Information Security, monitor, guide and advise the business areas in their respective areas of expertise (second line of defense); and (3) Internal Audit independently reviews business and support areas to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations and internal policies and procedures (third line of defense);  

•  

provides appropriate reporting to management and our board of directors and their respective committees; and  

•  

trains our employees on our risk management processes and philosophy.  

Risk Oversight, Roles and Responsibilities  

Responsibility for risk management is assigned at several different levels of our organization, including our board of directors and its committees. Each business area within our organization is primarily responsible for managing its specific risks. In addition, our second line of defense support areas are responsible for providing our business areas with the training, systems and specialized expertise necessary to properly perform their risk management responsibilities.  

Board of Directors. The Navient board of directors and its standing committees oversee our strategic direction, including setting our risk management philosophy, tolerance and parameters; and assessing the risks our businesses face as well as our risk management practices. It approves our annual business plan, periodically reviews our strategic approach and priorities and spends significant time considering our capital requirements and our dividend and share repurchase levels and activities. We escalate to our board of directors any significant departures from established tolerances and parameters and review new and emerging risks with them. Standing committees of our board of directors include Executive, Audit, Compensation and Personnel, Nominations and Governance, and Risk. Charters for each committee providing their specific responsibilities and areas of risk oversight are published on our website together with the names of the directors serving on these committees.  

Chief Executive Officer. Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for establishing our risk management culture and ensuring business areas operate within risk parameters and in accordance with our annual business plan.  

Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. Our Chief Risk and Compliance Officer is responsible for ensuring proper oversight, management and reporting to our board of directors and management regarding our risk management practices.  

Enterprise Risk and Compliance Committee. Our Enterprise Risk and Compliance Committee is an executive management-level committee where senior management reviews our significant risks, receives reports on adherence to established risk parameters, provides direction on mitigation of our risks and closure of issues and supervises our enterprise risk management program. This committee also oversees regulatory compliance risk management activities including compliance regulatory training, compliance regulatory change management, compliance risk assessment, transactional testing and monitoring, customer complaint monitoring, policies and procedures, privacy and information sharing practices, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and our Code of Business Conduct. This committee also evaluates risks associated with new or modified business and makes recommendations regarding proposed business initiatives based on their inherent risks and controls.  

Credit and Loan Loss Committee. Our Credit and Loan Loss Committee is an executive management-level committee that oversees our credit and portfolio management monitoring and strategies, the sufficiency of our loan loss reserves, and current or emerging issues affecting delinquency and default trends which may result in adjustments in our allowances for loan losses.  

Disclosure Committee. Our Disclosure Committee reviews our periodic SEC reporting documents, earnings releases and related disclosure policies and procedures, and evaluates whether modified or additional disclosures are required.  

44 

Asset and Liability Committee. Our Asset and Liability Committee oversees our investment portfolio and strategy and our compliance with our investment policy.  

Other Management-Level Committees. We have other management-level committees that oversee various other Navient business activities including critical accounting assumptions, human resources management, and incentive compensation governance.  

Internal Audit Risk Assessment  

Navient’s Internal Audit function monitors Navient’s various risk management and compliance efforts, identifies areas that may require increased focus and resources, and reports its findings and recommendations to executive management and the Audit Committee of our board of directors. Internal Audit performs an annual risk assessment evaluating the risk of all significant components of our company and uses the results to develop an annual risk-based internal audit plan as well as a multi-year rotational audit schedule.  

Risk Appetite Framework  

Navient’s Risk Appetite Framework establishes the level of risk we are willing to accept within each risk category in pursuit of our business strategy. The Risk Committee of our board of directors reviews our Risk Appetite Framework annually, helping to ensure consistency in our business decisions, monitoring and reporting. Our management-level Enterprise Risk and Compliance Committee monitors approved risk limits and thresholds to ensure our businesses are operating within approved risk limits. Through ongoing monitoring of risk exposures, management identifies potential risks and develops appropriate responses and mitigation strategies.  

Risk Categories  

Our Risk Appetite Framework segments Navient’s risks across nine domains: (1) credit; (2) market; (3) funding and liquidity; (4) operational; (5) compliance; (6) legal; (7) governance; (8) reputational/political; and (9) strategic.  

Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk to earnings or capital resulting from an obligor’s failure to meet the terms of any contract with us or otherwise fail to perform as agreed. Navient has credit or counterparty risk exposure with borrowers and cosigners of our Private Education Loans and Private Education Refinance Loans, counterparties with whom we have entered derivative or other similar contracts and entities with whom we make investments. Credit and counterparty risks are overseen by our Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and our management-level Credit and Loan Loss Committee. The credit risk related to our Private Education Loans and Private Education Refinance Loans is managed within a credit risk infrastructure which includes: (i) a well-defined underwriting, asset quality and collection policy framework; (ii) an ongoing monitoring and review process of portfolio concentration and trends; (iii) assignment and management of credit and loss forecasting authorities and responsibilities; and (iv) establishment of an allowance for loan losses. Credit risk related to derivative contracts is managed by reviewing counterparties for credit strength on an ongoing basis and through our credit policies, which place limits on our exposure with any single counterparty and, in most cases, require collateral to secure the position. Our Chief Risk and Compliance Officer reports regularly to our board of directors and both the Risk and Audit Committees of the board on credit risk management. 

Market Risk. Market risk is the risk to earnings or capital resulting from changes in market conditions, such as interest rates, index mismatches, credit spreads, commodity prices or volatilities. Navient is exposed to various types of market risk, including mismatches between the maturity/duration of assets and liabilities, interest rate risk and other risks that arise through the management of our investment, debt and education loan portfolios. Market risk exposure is overseen by our Chief Financial Officer and our management-level Asset and Liability Committee, which are responsible for managing market risks associated with our assets and liabilities and recommending limits to be included in our risk appetite and investment structure. These activities are closely tied to those related to the management of our funding and liquidity risks. The Risk Committee of our board of directors periodically reviews and approves the investment, asset and liability management policies, establishes and monitors various tolerances or other risk measurements, as well as contingency funding plans developed and administered by our Asset and Liability Committee. The Risk Committee and our Chief Financial Officer report to the full board of directors on matters of market risk management.  

Funding and Liquidity Risk. Funding and liquidity risk is the risk to earnings, capital or the conduct of our business arising from the inability to meet our obligations when they become due without incurring unacceptable losses, such as the ability to fund liability maturities or invest in future asset growth and business operations at reasonable market rates. Our primary liquidity risks are any mismatch between the maturity of our assets and liabilities and the servicing of our indebtedness. Navient’s Chief Financial Officer oversees our funding and liquidity management activities and is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategies, analyzing and monitoring our liquidity risk, maintaining excess liquidity and accessing diverse funding sources depending on current market conditions. Funding and liquidity risks are overseen and recommendations approved primarily through our management-level Asset and Liability Committee. The Risk Committee of our board of directors periodically reviews and approves our funding and liquidity positions and the contingency funding plan developed and administered by our Asset and  

45 

Liability Committee. The Risk Committee also receives regular reports on our performance against funding and liquidity plans at each of its meetings.  

Operational Risk. Operational risk is the risk to earnings or the conduct of our business resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external events. Operational risk is pervasive, existing in all business areas, functional units, legal entities and geographic locations, and it includes information technology risk, cybersecurity risk, physical security risk on tangible assets, third-party vendor risk, legal risk, compliance risk and reputational risk. Operational risk exposures are managed by business area management and our second and third lines of defense, with oversight by our management-level committees. The Risk Committee of our board of directors receives operations reports at each regularly scheduled meeting. The Risk Committee also receives business development updates regarding our various business initiatives, receives periodic information security and cybersecurity updates and reviews operational and systems-related matters to ensure their implementation produces no significant internal control issues.  

Compliance, Legal and Governance Risk. Compliance, legal and governance risks are subsets of operational risk but are recognized as a separate and complementary risk category given their importance in our business. Compliance risk is the risk to earnings, capital or reputation arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards. Legal risk is the risk to earnings, capital or reputation manifested by claims made through the legal system and may arise from a product or service, a transaction, a business relationship, property (real, personal or intellectual), conduct of an employee or change in law or regulation. Governance risk is the risk of not establishing and maintaining a control environment that aligns with stakeholder and regulatory expectations, including tone at the top and board performance. These risks are inherent in all of our businesses. The Audit Committee of our board of directors oversees our monitoring and control of legal and compliance risks. The Audit Committee annually reviews our Compliance Plan and significant breaches of our Code of Business Conduct and receives regular reports from executive management responsible for the regulatory and compliance risk management functions. The board of directors and the Audit Committee receive reports on significant litigation and regulatory matters at each regularly scheduled meeting. 

Reputational/Political Risk. Reputational risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from damage to our reputation in the view of, or loss of the trust of, customers and the general public. Political risk is the closely related risk to earnings or capital arising from damage to our relationships with governmental entities, regulators and political leaders and candidates. These risks can arise due to both our own acts and omissions (both real and perceived), and the acts and omissions of other industry participants or other third parties, and they are inherent in all of our businesses. Reputational risk and political risk are managed through a combination of business area management and our second and third lines of defense. The Nominations and Governance Committee of our board of directors oversees our reputational and political risk and regularly receives reports on these matters. 

Strategic Risk. Strategic risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from our potential inability to successfully carry out our strategy. This risk can arise due to both our own acts or omissions, and the acts or omissions of other industry participants or other third parties, and it is inherent in all of our businesses. Strategic risk is managed through a combination of business area management and our second and third lines of defense.

Supervision and Regulation  

Regulatory Oversight  

We operate in a highly regulated industry. Many aspects of our businesses are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and administrative oversight. The following is a summary of the various statutes and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries. This summary is not a comprehensive analysis of all applicable laws and is qualified by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations referenced below. 

The Dodd-Frank Act was adopted to reform and strengthen regulation and supervision of the U.S. financial services industry. It contains comprehensive provisions that govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. It imposes additional regulations, requirements and oversight on almost every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including increased capital and liquidity requirements, limits on leverage and enhanced supervisory authority. Some of these provisions apply to Navient and its various businesses and securitization vehicles.  

The Consumer Financial Protection Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to directly or indirectly enforce those laws and examine financial institutions for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to impose fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. It also has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. Since its creation, the CFPB has been active in its supervision, examination and enforcement of financial services companies. In January 2017, the CFPB filed a lawsuit against Navient alleging several unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, and other violations of consumer protection statutes. Additional information on the CFPB lawsuit is included in “Note 12 – Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees” in this Form 10-K. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the CFPB and to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act’s general prohibition against unfair, deceptive and abusive practices. The Attorneys General of the State of Illinois, the State of Washington, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State of California, the State of Mississippi and the State of New Jersey have also filed lawsuits against Navient and some of its subsidiaries containing similar alleged violations of consumer protection laws as those alleged in the CFPB lawsuit as well as several additional areas. We refer to the Illinois, Washington, Pennsylvania, California, Mississippi and New Jersey Attorneys General collectively as the “State Attorneys General.” Additional information on the State Attorneys General lawsuits is included in “Note 12 – Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees” in this Form 10-K. 

Higher Education Act. The HEA is the primary law that authorizes federal student aid programs for higher education. Navient is subject to the HEA and its education loan operations are periodically reviewed by ED and Guarantors. As a servicer of federal education loans, Navient is subject to ED regulations regarding financial responsibility and administrative capability that govern all third-party servicers of insured education loans. In connection with its servicing operations on behalf of Guarantor clients, Navient must comply with ED regulations that govern Guarantor activities as well as agreements for reimbursement between ED and our Guarantor clients. While the HEA is required to be reviewed and "reauthorized" by Congress every five years, Congress has not reauthorized the HEA since 2008, choosing to temporarily extend the Act each year since 2013. In December 2017, the Education Committee of the House of Representative approved The Higher Education Act Reauthorization Bill (H.R. 4508 Prosper Act). The Prosper Act contained various proposed amendments to the HEA that sought to revise the governance of federal financial aid provided to students pursuing a postsecondary education. In September 2019, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee proposed a narrow reauthorization of the HEA entitled the “Student Aid Improvement Act of 2019”. Neither of these attempts to reauthorize the HEA have been successful. We cannot predict whether or when legislation will be passed or how it would impact us. 

Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. As a third-party service provider to financial institutions, Navient is also subject to periodic examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). FFIEC is a formal interagency body of the U.S. government empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions by the Federal Reserve Banks (FRB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the CFPB and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions.  

47 

Consumer Protection and Privacy. Navient’s Education Loan segment is subject to federal and state consumer protection, privacy and related laws and regulations and is subject to examination by the CFPB. Some of the more significant federal laws and regulations include:  

•  

various laws governing unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices;  

•  

the Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;  

•  

the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, which governs the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies;  

•  

the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;  

•  

the SCRA, which applies to all debts incurred prior to commencement of active military service (including education loans) and limits the amount of interest, including certain fees or charges that are related to the obligation or liability; and  

•  

the TCPA, which governs communication methods that may be used to contact customers.  

In addition to our Education Loan segment, Navient’s Business Processing Services segment is subject to federal and state consumer protection, privacy and related laws and regulations. Some of the more significant federal statutes are the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and additional provisions of the acts listed above, as well as the HEA and the various laws and regulations that pertain to government contractors. These activities are also subject to state laws and regulations similar to the federal laws and regulations listed above. 

Regulatory Outlook  

In 2021, we expect our regulatory environment will continue to be challenging. A new presidential administration with the benefit of a unified majority in Congress will be much more likely to pass legislation and sponsor regulatory initiatives that will have an impact on our businesses. Additionally, as the COVID-19 pandemic begins to abate, we anticipate that regulators will be more focused on conducting regulatory audits and initiating enforcement actions. 

We anticipate a number of prominent themes will emerge:  

•  

The number and configuration of regulators, particularly the CFPB, State Attorneys General and various state legislators, is likely to change which may add to the complexity, cost and unpredictability of timing for resolution of particular regulatory issues.  

•  

The regulatory, compliance and risk control structures of financial institutions subject to enforcement actions by state and federal regulators are frequently cited, regardless of whether past practices have been changed, and enforcement orders have often included detailed demands for increased compliance, audit and board supervision, as well as the use of third-party consultants or monitors to recommend further changes or monitor remediation efforts.  

•  

Issues first identified with respect to one consumer product class or distribution channel are sometimes applied to other product classes or channels.  

We expect that the regulators overseeing our businesses will continue to be active and that consumer protection regulations, standards, supervision, examination and enforcement practices will continue to evolve in both detail and scope. This evolution has added and may continue to significantly add to Navient’s compliance, servicing and operating costs. We have invested in compliance through multiple steps including realignment of Navient’s compliance management system to a servicing, collections and business services business model; dedicated compliance resources for certain topics (such as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA); the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA); unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices (UDAAP); and third-party vendor management) to focus on consumer expectations; formation of business support operations to enhance risk, control and compliance functions in each business area; additional regulatory training for front-line employees to ensure obligations are understood and followed during interactions with customers, as well as additional regulatory training for our board of directors to enhance their ability to oversee the Company’s risk framework and compliance as it and the regulatory environment changes; and expanded oversight and analysis of complaint trends to identify and remediate, if necessary, areas of potential consumer harm. Despite these increased activities, our current operations and compliance processes may not satisfy evolving regulatory standards. Past practices or products may continue to be the focus of examinations, inquiries or lawsuits.  

As described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Risk Management,” Navient has implemented a coordinated, formal enterprise risk management system aimed at reducing business and regulatory risks.  

48 

Listed below are some of the most significant recent and pending regulatory changes that have the potential to affect Navient.  

Education Loan Servicing and Consumer Lending. The CFPB has been active in the education loan industry and undertook a number of initiatives in recent years relative to the private education loan market and education loan servicing. In addition, several states have enacted various state servicing and licensing requirements. We anticipate that these state activities will continue. It is possible that more states will propose or pass similar or different requirements on either holders of education loans or their servicers. Depending on the nature of these laws or rules, they may impose additional or different requirements than Navient faces at the federal level. 

Debt Collection Supervision. The CFPB also maintains supervisory authority over larger consumer debt collectors. The CFPB recently updated its regulatory agenda making the likelihood and timing of any new debt collection regulation uncertain. The issuance of the CFPB’s rules does not preempt the various and varied levels of state consumer and collection regulations to which the activities of Navient’s subsidiaries are currently subject. Navient also utilizes third-party debt collectors to collect defaulted and charged-off education loans and will continue to be responsible for oversight of their procedures and controls.  

Oversight of Derivatives. The Dodd-Frank Act created a comprehensive new regulatory framework for derivatives transactions, to be implemented by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), other prudential regulators and the SEC. This framework, among other things, subjects certain swap participants to new capital and margin requirements, recordkeeping and business conduct standards and imposes registration and regulation of swap dealers and major swap participants. The scope of potential exemptions continues to be defined through agency rulemakings. Even where Navient or a securitization trust sponsored by Navient qualifies for an exemption, many of its derivatives counterparties are subject to capital, margin and business conduct requirements and therefore Navient’s business may be impacted. Where Navient or the securitization trusts it sponsors do not qualify for an exemption, Navient or an existing or future securitization trust sponsored by Navient may be unable to enter into new swaps to hedge interest rate or currency risk or the costs associated with such swaps may increase. With respect to existing securitization trusts, an inability to amend, novate or otherwise materially modify existing swap contracts could result in a downgrade of its outstanding asset-backed securities. As a result, Navient’s business, ability to access the capital markets for financing and costs may be impacted by these regulations.

RISK FACTORS  

We employ an enterprise risk management philosophy and framework which seeks to identify the material risks impacting our business and provides a process for evaluating and quantifying such risks. Our Enterprise Risk and Compliance Committee monitors approved risk limits and thresholds to ensure our businesses are operating within approved risk parameters. Our Risk Appetite Framework segments our risk across nine risk domains: (1) credit; (2) market; (3) funding and liquidity; (4) operational; (5) compliance; (6) legal; (7) governance; (8) reputational/political; and (9) strategic. The risk factors enumerated in this section are presented in a manner that is consistent with this overall risk framework. 

Based on current conditions, we believe that the following list identifies the material risk factors that could affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These risks and risk domains are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations in future periods. Material risks that could apply generally to any company are listed below under the caption “General Risk Factors.” In addition, our reaction to future developments as well as our competitors’ and regulators’ reactions to these developments may affect our future results.  

COVID-19 RISK. 

The impact of COVID-19 and related risks may materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity and such impacts could continue for an unknown length of time. 

Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the global pandemic related to COVID-19 began to impact the global economy and our results of operations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local, and foreign governments have put in place, and others in the future may put in place, quarantines, executive orders, shelter-in-place orders, and similar government orders and restrictions in order to control the spread of the disease. In the general economy, these orders or restrictions, or the perception that these orders or restrictions could occur, have resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions, and cancellation or postponement of events as well as a general decline in economic activity and consumer confidence and increases in job losses and unemployment. As a result, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially affected, as described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—The Year in Review—Navient’s Response to COVID-19.” With respect to our operations, we have drastically modified the manner in which we conduct our business by expanding our work-from-home capabilities and moving 90% of our team to a work-from-home status. While most of our operations can be performed remotely and are operating effectively at the present, there is no guarantee that this will continue or that we will continue to be as effective while working remotely. In addition, as result of the general decline in economic conditions and the increase in unemployment rates, we have experienced significant increases in the number of requests for forbearance and other loan modifications in our education loan portfolios. A continued or worsening deterioration in the economy could further adversely affect the credit quality of our borrowers, resulting in an increased occurrence of defaults and/or requiring more frequent use of loan modification tools. Further, because of the size and breadth of this pandemic, all the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known and may not emerge for some time. If the COVID-19 pandemic is prolonged, it could deepen the impacts on our results or operations, financial condition and liquidity, and may also heighten many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

CREDIT RISK.  

Economic conditions and the creditworthiness of third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  

Our success is largely dependent upon the creditworthiness of our customers, especially with respect to our education loans. Our research consistently indicates that borrower unemployment rates and the failure of in-school borrowers to graduate or otherwise complete their education are two of the most significant economic factors that affect loan performance. Any material changes in graduation or completion rates could increase or decrease delinquencies and defaults. Additionally, modifications to the original repayment terms in the form of loan forbearance, deferment, grace periods and the use of payment modification programs, including income-based repayment programs, can individually and cumulatively impact the performance of our loan portfolios. Modifications to private loans may lower the potential return on investment and may have the related effect of delaying defaults which would otherwise have become apparent in the performance of our portfolios.  

As a result of world-wide, U.S. federal and state responses to COVID-19 as well as the overall economic conditions, the unemployment rate has increased significantly and may show additional increases of uncertain magnitude as the prolonged impact of the pandemic takes effect. Consequently, we have experienced significant increases in the number of requests for forbearance and other loan modifications in our education loan portfolios. General economic and employment conditions, including employment rates for recent college graduates, can have a significant impact on loan delinquency and default rates. An extended or worsening deterioration in the economy  

50 

could further adversely affect the credit quality of our borrowers, resulting in an increased occurrence of defaults and/or requiring more frequent use of loan modification tools. As a result of COVID-19 we have experienced lower delinquency rates in both our FFELP and Private Education loan portfolios primarily due to increases in forbearance rates. While we cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 crisis, its impact on employment and the speed with which the economy recovers, we are paying close attention to the needs of our customers in an effort to assess the path and timing of any potential recovery. If actual loan performance is worse than our estimates, it could materially affect our allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses adversely affecting our results of operation. Future defaults could be higher than anticipated due to a variety of these factors that are outside of our control. Higher credit-related losses and weaker credit quality could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and limit our funding options, including our access to the capital markets.  

Defaults on education loans held by us, particularly Private Education Loans, could adversely affect our earnings.  

FFELP Loans are insured or guaranteed by state or not-for-profit agencies and are also protected by contractual rights to recovery from the United States pursuant to guaranty agreements among ED and these agencies. These guarantees generally cover at least 97% of a FFELP Loan’s principal and accrued interest upon default and, in limited circumstances, 100% of the loan’s principal and accrued interest. We are exposed to credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the FFELP Loans in our portfolio. In addition, under certain circumstances, if we fail to service FFELP Loans in compliance with HEA we may jeopardize the insurance, guarantees and federal support we receive on these loans. A small percentage of our FFELP Loan portfolio has become permanently uninsured as a result of these regulations and we anticipate this will continue to a limited extent in the future. Under such circumstances, we bear the full credit exposure on such previously insured loans.  

We bear the full credit exposure on the loans in our Private Education Loan portfolio. We believe that delinquencies are an important indicator of the potential future credit performance for Private Education Loans. Our delinquencies as a percentage of Private Education Loans in repayment were 2.6% at December 31, 2020. For a complete discussion of our loan delinquencies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Financial Condition – Private Education Loan Portfolio Performance.”  

Future defaults could be higher than anticipated due to a variety of factors, such as downturns in the economy, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory changes and other unforeseen future trends. According to Company-sponsored independent research, young adults who stopped attending college before earning a degree or certificate are among those most likely to have trouble making payments. Losses on Private Education Loans are also impacted by various risk characteristics that may be specific to individual loans. Loan status (in-school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), loan seasoning (number of months in which a payment has been made by a customer), underwriting criteria (e.g., credit scores), existence of a cosigner, school type and whether a loan is a TDR are all factors that can impact the likelihood of default. Additionally, general economic and employment conditions, including employment rates for recent college graduates, can have a significant impact on loan delinquency and default rates. If actual loan performance is worse than currently estimated, it could materially affect our estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses and as a result adversely affect our results of operations.  

The Company recently adopted an accounting standard update that resulted in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses.  

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments — Credit Losses,” which replaced the current “incurred loss” model for recognizing credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the CECL model. The new CECL standard became effective for us on January 1, 2020. Under the CECL model, we are required to measure and recognize an allowance for loan losses that estimates remaining expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date. This resulted in us presenting certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as our loans held for investment, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and quarterly thereafter. This differs significantly from the “incurred loss” model that was required under prior GAAP, which delayed recognition of losses until it was probable a loss had been incurred. Accordingly, the adoption of the CECL model materially changed the way we determine our allowance for loan losses and required us to significantly increase our allowance and reduce shareholders’ equity on the January 1, 2020 implementation date. As a result of the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020, we increased our loan loss reserves which resulted in a reduction of our shareholder equity by $620 million. In the future, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the evaluation of our expected credit losses is inherently subjective and requires estimates that may be subject to significant changes. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  

51 

Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Allowance for Loan Losses” and “Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies” for further discussion of the CECL standard and its impact as of the January 1, 2020 adoption date. 

Our Consumer Lending segment exposes us to credit underwriting risks based upon the credit model we use to forecast loss rates. If we are unable to effectively forecast loss rates, it could materially adversely affect our operating results.  

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we acquired Earnest, a leading financial technology and education finance company. Earnest is now one of the leading providers of education refinance loans. In 2019, Earnest entered the “in-school” lending market. We underwrite new Private Education Loans within our Consumer Lending segment based upon our analysis of extensive credit criteria. Criteria reviewed in underwriting consumer loans may include any or all of the following: (i) employment or offer of employment, income and assets, which are generally verified through connected accounts; (ii) career experience, stability of employment, and specialization; (iii) qualifying credit history, taking into account credit score; (iv) debt to income ratio; (v) demonstrated ability to pay through free cash flow calculations; (vi) attendance at or graduation from an eligible post-secondary school; and (vii) savings. We define free cash flow generally as after-tax monthly income of a borrower minus the sum of rent or mortgage payments, student loan payments and any other fixed expenses of such borrower.  

We do not rely on any single factor in making our underwriting decisions. Each of the above factors is reviewed and weighted depending on the individual borrower’s or co-borrower’s circumstances at the time the underwriting decision is made. If our underwriting process does not effectively forecast our losses, our operating results, cash flow or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  

MARKET, FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK.  

Our business is affected by the cost and availability of funding in the capital markets.  

The capital markets may from time to time experience periods of significant volatility, such as the volatility we have experienced, and may experience again, as a result of COVID-19 and its impacts on the economy. This volatility can dramatically and adversely affect financing costs when compared to historical norms or make funding unavailable at any costs. We cannot provide any assurance that the cost and availability of funding in the capital markets will not continue to be impacted by the pandemic. In addition to COVID-19, other factors that could make financing more expensive or unavailable to us include, but are not limited to, financial losses, events that have an adverse impact on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, events that have an adverse impact on the financial services industry generally, counterparty availability, negative credit rating actions with respect to us, asset-backed securities sponsored by us or the U.S. federal government, changes affecting our assets, the ability of existing or future Navient-sponsored securitization trusts to hedge interest rate and currency risk, corporate and regulatory actions, absolute and comparative interest rate changes, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory and tax environments governing funding transactions, including existing or future securitization and derivatives transactions. If financing is difficult, expensive or unavailable, our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  

The transition away from the LIBOR reference rate to an alternative reference rate may create uncertainty in the capital markets and may negatively impact the value of existing LIBOR based financial instruments.  

The London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, has historically served as a global benchmark for determining interest rates on commercial and consumer loans, bonds, derivatives and numerous other financial instruments. LIBOR is the reference rate for most of our student loans, consumer loans, bonds, asset-backed securities (ABS), other financing facilities, and derivatives (financial instruments). On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that by the end of 2021, LIBOR would no longer be sustained through the FCA’s efforts to compel banks’ participation in setting the benchmark. As a result, we are unable to predict if LIBOR reference rates will stop being available or when that may occur. We are also unable to predict whether or when an alternative reference rate will become a standard global benchmark and suitable replacement for LIBOR. We are therefore unable to predict what the replacement reference rate or rates will be for our existing financial instruments that are currently indexed to LIBOR, the extent to which our financial instruments will transition to the same replacement reference rate, or the timing of a transition. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $200 billion notional of financial instruments indexed to LIBOR. Most of these financial instruments do not include provisions clearly specifying a method for transitioning from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate, and it is not yet known how courts or regulators will view the transition away from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate. As a result, it is difficult to predict the impact that a cessation of LIBOR would have on the value and performance of our existing financial instruments. These uncertainties regarding the possible cessation of LIBOR or their resolution could have a material adverse impact on our funding costs, net interest margin, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies, and other aspects of our business and financial results.  

52 

Higher or lower than expected prepayments of loans could change the expected net interest income we receive as the holder of the Residual Interests of securitization trusts holding education loans or cause the bonds issued by a securitization trust to be paid at a different speed than originally anticipated. These factors could materially alter our net interest margin or the value of our Residual Interests.  

The rate at which borrowers prepay their loans can have a material impact on our net interest margin and the value of our Residual Interests. Prepayment rates and levels are subject to a variety of economic, competitive and other factors, including changes in interest rates, availability of alternative financings, legislative and regulatory changes affecting the education loan market and the general economy. FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans may be voluntarily prepaid without penalty by the borrower, refinanced or consolidated with the borrower’s other loans through refinancing.  

FFELP Loans may also be repaid after default by the Guarantors of FFELP Loans. Conversely, borrowers might not choose to prepay their education loans, or the terms of the education loans may be extended as a result of grace periods, deferment periods, income-driven repayment plans or other repayment terms or monthly payment amount modifications agreed to by the servicer, for example. FFELP Loan borrowers may be eligible for various existing income-based repayment programs under which borrowers can qualify for reduced or zero monthly payment or even debt forgiveness after a certain number of years of repayment.  

Future initiatives by ED, or by Congress or future laws, executive orders or other policy statements to encourage or force consolidation, abolish existing or create additional income-based repayment or debt forgiveness programs or establish other policies and programs including but not limited to those proposed by several presidential campaigns could affect prepayments on education loans. We cannot predict if or when or in what form any of these future actions may occur. Prepayment rates can also be impacted by student loan refinancing. Refinance products offered by us and our competitors may increase the repayment rate on our FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans.  

While we anticipate some variability in prepayment levels, extraordinary or extended increases or decreases in prepayment rates could materially affect our liquidity, interest income, net interest margin and the value of our Residual Interests. Additionally, a prolonged introduction of significant amounts of subsidized funding into the Private Education Loan market at below market interest rates — whether from federal or private sources —could increase the prepayment rates of our existing Private Education Loans and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. When, as a result of unanticipated prepayment levels, education loans within a securitization trust amortize faster than originally contracted, the trust’s pool balance may decline at a rate faster than the prepayment rate assumed when the trust’s bonds were originally issued. If the trust’s pool balance declines faster than originally anticipated, in most of our securitization structures, the bonds issued by that trust will also be repaid faster than originally anticipated. In such cases, our net interest income may decrease and the value of any retained Residual Interest in the trust may similarly decline.  

Conversely, when education loans within a securitization trust amortize more slowly than originally contracted, the trust’s pool balance may decline more slowly than the prepayment rate assumed when the trust’s bonds were originally issued, and the bonds may be repaid more slowly than originally anticipated. In these cases, our net interest income increases and the value of any retained Residual Interest in the trust may increase. In addition, if the prepayment rate is especially slow and certain rights of the sellers or the servicer are not exercised or are insufficient or other action is not taken to counter the slower prepayment rate, the trust’s bonds may not be repaid by their legal final maturity date(s), which could result in an event of default under the underlying securitization agreements.  

Finally, rating agencies may place bonds on watch or change their ratings on (or their ratings methodology for) the bonds issued by a securitization trust, possibly raising or lowering their ratings, based upon these prepayment rates and their perception of the risk posed by those rates to the timing of the trust cash flows. Placing bonds on watch, changing ratings negatively, proposing or making changes to ratings methodology could: (i) affect our liquidity; (ii) impede our access to the securitization markets; (iii) require changes to our securitization structures; (iv) impact our net interest margins; and/or (v) raise or lower the value of our Residual Interests of our future securitization transactions.  

Our unhedged Floor Income is dependent on the future interest rate environment and therefore is variable, which may adversely affect our earnings.  

FFELP Loans disbursed before April 1, 2006 generally earn interest at the higher of either the borrower rate, which is fixed over a period of time, or a floating rate based on a Special Allowance Payment or SAP formula set by ED. As we have generally financed our FFELP Loans with floating rate debt whose interest is matched closely to the floating nature of the applicable SAP formula. Historically, these loans have been indexed to either the Treasury bill, commercial paper or one-month LIBOR rates. If a decline in interest rates causes the borrower rate to exceed the SAP formula rate, we will continue to earn interest on the loan at the fixed borrower rate while the floating rate interest on our debt will continue to decline. The additional spread earned between the fixed borrower rate and the SAP formula rate is referred to as “Floor Income.” The replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate may have a further detrimental impact on our LIBOR-indexed debt if rates suddenly rise as new market borrowing activity transfers to other benchmark rates. Depending on the type of FFELP Loan and when it was originated, the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to a market rate on July 1 of each year. For loans where the borrower rate is  

53 

fixed to term, we may earn Floor Income for an extended period of time; for those loans where the borrower interest rate is reset annually on July 1, we may earn Floor Income to the next reset date. In accordance with legislation enacted in 2006, holders of FFELP Loans are required to rebate Floor Income to ED for all FFELP Loans disbursed on or after April 1, 2006.  

Floor Income can be volatile as market rates and the rates on the underlying education loans move up and down. Subject to prevailing market conditions, we generally hedge this risk by using derivatives in an effort to lock in a portion of our Floor Income over the term of the contract. A rise in interest rates will reduce the amount of Floor Income received on the FFELP Loans not presently hedged with derivatives, which will compress our net interest margins. Additionally, net interest margins can be negatively impacted by unusual variances between one-month and three-month LIBOR.  

Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, increase our borrowing costs or limit our access to the capital markets.  

As of December 31, 2020, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch rated our long-term unsecured debt below investment grade. In addition, the capital markets for sub-investment grade companies are not as liquid as those involving investment grade entities. These factors have resulted in a higher cost of funds for us and have caused our senior unsecured debt to trade with greater volatility.  

Our unsecured debt totaled $8.4 billion at December 31, 2020. We utilize the unsecured debt markets to help fund our business and refinance outstanding debt. The amount, type and cost of this funding directly affects the cost of operating our business and growing our assets and is dependent upon outside factors, including our credit rating from rating agencies. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be reduced further. A reduction in the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt could adversely affect our liquidity, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets and place incremental pressure on net interest income.  

Adverse market conditions or an inability to effectively manage our liquidity risk could negatively impact our ability to meet our liquidity and funding needs, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.  

We must effectively manage our liquidity risk. We require liquidity to meet cash requirements such as day-to-day operating expenses, origination of loans, required payments of principal and interest on borrowings, and distributions to shareholders. We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the repayment of $0.7 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature in the short term (i.e., over the next 12 months) and the remaining $7.7 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature in the long term, primarily through our current cash, investments and unencumbered FFELP Loan and Private Education Refinance Loan portfolios, the predictable operating cash flows provided by operating activities, the repayment of principal on unencumbered education loan assets, and the distribution of overcollateralization from our securitization trusts. We may also, depending on market conditions and availability, draw down on our secured FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan facilities, issue term ABS, enter into additional Private Education Loan ABS repurchase facilities, or issue additional unsecured debt. We may maintain too much liquidity, which can be costly, or may be too illiquid, which could result in financial distress during times of financial stress or capital market disruptions.  

The interest rate characteristics of our earning assets do not always match the interest rate characteristics of our funding arrangements, which may have a negative impact on our net interest income and net income.  

Net interest income is the primary source of cash flow generated by our portfolios of FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans. At the present, interest earned on FFELP Loans and variable rate Private Education Loans is primarily indexed to one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate, respectively, while certain of our debt is indexed to rates other than one-month LIBOR and Prime Rate, or if indexed to one-month LIBOR, it has a different repricing frequency.  

The different interest rate characteristics of our loan portfolios and the liabilities funding these loan portfolios result in basis risk and repricing risk. It is not economically feasible to hedge all of our exposure to such risks. While the asset and hedge indices are short-term with rate movements that are typically highly correlated, there can be no assurance that the historically high correlation will not be disrupted by capital market dislocations or other factors not within our control. There have been situations in the past in which we experienced widening spreads between one-month and three-month LIBOR and the cost of hedging this variance was prohibitive. We cannot provide any assurance that such a situation will not reoccur and if it did reoccur, it would potentially reduce our net interest margins and net income. In these circumstances, our earnings could be materially adversely affected.  

Our use of derivatives to manage interest rate and foreign currency sensitivity exposes us to credit and market risk that could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and liquidity.  

We strive to maintain an overall strategy that uses derivatives to minimize the economic effect of interest rate and/or foreign currency changes. However, developing an effective strategy for dealing with these movements is complex, and no strategy can completely avoid the risks associated with these fluctuations. For example, our education loan portfolio is subject to prepayment risk that could result in being under- or over-hedged, which could result in material  

54 

losses. As a result, there can be no assurance that hedging activities using derivatives will effectively manage our interest rate or foreign currency sensitivity, have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition or not adversely impact our liquidity.  

Our use of derivatives also exposes us to market risk and credit risk. Market risk is the chance of financial loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market liquidity. Our Floor Income Contracts and basis swaps we use to manage earnings variability caused by different reset characteristics on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value, called the “mark-to-market,” of these derivative instruments is included in our statement of income without a corresponding mark-to-market of the economically hedged item. A decline in the fair value of these derivatives could have a material adverse effect on our reported earnings. In addition, a change in the mark-to-market value of these instruments may cause us to have to post more collateral to our counterparty or to a clearing house. If these values change significantly, the increased collateral posting requirement could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. 

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations under a contract. Credit risk is limited to the loss of the fair value gain in a derivative that the counterparty or clearinghouse owes or will owe in the future to us. If a counterparty or clearinghouse fails to perform its obligations, we could, depending on the type of counterparty arrangement, experience a loss of liquidity or an economic loss. In addition, we might not be able to cost effectively replace the derivative position depending on the type of derivative and the current economic environment.  

Our securitization trusts, which we consolidate on our balance sheet, had $3.6 billion of Euro and British Pound Sterling denominated bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2020. To convert these non-U.S. dollar denominated bonds into U.S. dollar liabilities, the trusts have entered into foreign-currency swaps with highly rated counterparties. A failure by a swap counterparty to perform its obligations could, if the swap has a positive fair value to us and was not adequately collateralized, materially and adversely affect our earnings.  

OPERATIONAL RISKS.  

If we do not effectively and continually align our cost structure with our business operations, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  

We continually need to align our cost structure with our business operations. The ability to properly size our cost structure is dependent upon a number of variables, including our ability to successfully execute on our business plans and growth initiatives and future legislative or regulatory changes. If we undertake cost reductions based on our business plan, those reductions could be too dramatic and could cause disruptions in our business, reductions in the quality of the services we provide or cause us to fail to comply with applicable regulatory standards. Alternatively, we may fail to implement, or be unable to achieve, necessary cost savings commensurate with our business and prospects. In either case, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  

A failure of our operating systems or infrastructure could disrupt our business, cause significant losses, result in regulatory action or damage our reputation.  

A failure of our operating systems or infrastructure could disrupt our business. Our business is dependent on the ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with contractual, legal and regulatory standards and our own product specifications, both currently and in the future. In 2018, we entered into a strategic agreement with First Data, now part of Fiserv, to become the primary provider of technology solutions for servicing our FFELP loans in addition to the technology role they already played with respect to Private Education Loans. We, however, still maintain the technology solutions for our other lines of business as well as our customer interactive infrastructure. As our processing demands and loan portfolios change, both in volume and in terms and conditions, our ability to develop and maintain our operating systems and infrastructure may become increasingly challenging. There is no assurance that we have adequately or efficiently developed, maintained, acquired or scaled such systems and infrastructure or will do so in the future.  

The servicing, financial, accounting, data processing and other operating systems and facilities that support our business may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to timely process transactions. Any such failure could adversely affect our ability to service our clients and result in financial loss or liability to our clients, disrupt our business, and result in regulatory action or cause reputational damage.  

Additionally, the COVID-19 crisis has caused us to drastically modify the manner in which we conduct our business. As the COVID-19 crisis evolved, we took early and decisive action to protect the health and safety of our employees. We expanded our work-from-home capabilities and implemented best practices for safety and hygiene to protect those who are unable to work remotely. While most of our operations can be performed remotely and are operating effectively at the present, there is no guarantee that this will continue or that we will continue to be as effective while working remotely. This is because our team is dispersed, many employees may have additional personal needs to attend to (such as looking after children as a result of school closures or a family member who becomes sick), and employees may become sick themselves and be unable to work.  

55 

Despite the plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a prolonged disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, Internet, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business. Additionally, we may experience disruptions in connection with the COVID-19 crisis, despite the steps we have taken to transition to a new working environment. Notwithstanding efforts to maintain business continuity, a disruptive event impacting our processing locations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If conditions related to COVID-19 improve and restrictions are lifted, similar uncertainties may arise with the return to work process. 

We depend on secure information technology, and a breach of our information technology systems could result in significant losses, disclosure of confidential customer information and reputational damage, which would adversely affect our business.  

Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal, confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures we deem reasonable and appropriate, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, malicious attacks and other events that could have a security impact beyond our control. These technologies, systems and networks, and those of third parties, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our business operations or those of our customers or other third parties. Information security risks for institutions that handle large numbers of financial transactions on a daily basis such as Navient have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties. In addition, our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks, and any failure by mobile or cloud technology service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential or propriety information. Moreover, the loss of confidential customer identification information could harm our reputation, result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers and subject us to liability under state, federal and international laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenues and substantial penalties. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect in January 2020 and provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents and statutory fines for data security breaches or other CCPA violations. 

If one or more of such events occur, personal, confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks could be jeopardized or could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations that could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information, some of it through third parties. We maintain secure transmission capability and work to ensure that third parties follow similar procedures. Nevertheless, an interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. In the event personal, confidential or other information is jeopardized, intercepted, misused or mishandled, we may need to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to fines, penalties, litigation and settlement costs and financial losses that may either not be insured against or not be fully covered through insurance. If one or more of such events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.  

We depend on third parties for a wide array of services, systems and information technology applications, and a breach or violation of law by one of these third parties could disrupt our business or provide our competitors with an opportunity to enhance their position at our expense.  

We depend on third parties for a wide array of services, systems and information technology applications. Third-party vendors are significantly involved in many aspects of our software and systems development, servicing systems, the timely transmission of information across our data communication network, and for other telecommunications, processing, remittance and technology-related services in connection with our servicing or payment services businesses. In addition to technology applications, we also utilize various third-party debt collectors in the collection of defaulted Private Education Loans and in other areas. If a service provider fails to provide the services required or expected, or fails to meet applicable contractual or regulatory requirements such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact our business by adversely affecting our ability to process customers’ transactions in a timely and accurate manner, otherwise hampering our ability to serve our customers, or subjecting us to litigation and regulatory risk for matters as diverse as poor vendor oversight or improper release or protection of personal information. Such a failure could also adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our networks and services and the quality of our brands, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.  

Our clients include federal, state and local governmental entities. This work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:  

•  

Government contractors are sometimes affected by the political or budgetary processes of the United States government. Sometimes the political process leads to government shutdown of all parts of the federal or state government. This can lead to temporary work stoppages or payment delays. Contracts may be cancelled or altered due to political or policy priorities.  

•  

Government entities in the United States often reserve the right to audit contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of business practices. These entities also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding systems, including systems of third parties, used in connection with the performance of the contracts. Negative findings from audits, investigations or inquiries could affect the contractor’s future revenues and profitability by preventing them, by operation of law or in practice, (i) from receiving new government contracts for some period of time or (ii) from being paid at the rate they believe is warranted.  

•  

If improper or illegal activities are found in the course of government audits or investigations, the contractor may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act. Additionally, we may be subject to administrative sanctions, which may include termination or non-renewal of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. Due to the inherent limitations of internal controls, it may not be possible to detect or prevent all improper or illegal activities.  

The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business or potential future business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.  

Our business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism, including a proxy contest or an unsolicited takeover proposal. 

We have been and may continue to be the subject of actions taken by activist shareholders. While we strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of our shareholders, and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all shareholders, we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist shareholders that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other shareholders. Responding to such actions may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, or divert the attention of our board of directors, management, and employees from the pursuit of our business strategies. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan.  

Even if we are successful in a proxy contest or in defending against any unsolicited takeover attempt, our business could be adversely affected by any such proxy contest or unsolicited takeover attempt because:  

•  

perceived uncertainties as to future direction may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or other strategic opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; 

•  

if individuals are elected or appointed to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our shareholders; and 

•  

if individuals are elected or appointed to our board of directors who do not agree with our strategic plan, the ability of our board of directors to function effectively could be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Uncertainties related to, or the results of, such actions could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our business. 

We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any matters relating to the foregoing actions by shareholders or the ultimate impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, and any of these matters or any further actions by this or other shareholders may impact and result in volatility or stagnation of the price of our stock. 

57 

REGULATORY, COMPLIANCE & LEGAL RISK.  

Our businesses are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways, and changes to such laws and regulations or changes in existing regulatory guidance or their interpretation or enforcement could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.  

Our businesses are subject to a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, rules, regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that these laws, rules, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models or objectives or in ways that affect our returns on investment by restricting existing activities or services, change how our companies operate or the characteristics of our assets, subjecting them to escalating costs or new or increased taxes or prohibiting them outright.  

The CFPB has authority with respect to our loan servicing business. It has authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to directly or indirectly enforce those laws and examine us for compliance. The CFPB also has examination and enforcement authority with respect to various federal consumer financial laws for some providers of consumer financial products and services, including us. New rules if implemented, could have a material effect on our loan servicing, consumer lending or asset recovery businesses and may result in significant capital expenditures to develop systems that enable us to comply with the new regulations.  

The CFPB is authorized to impose monetary penalties, collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. The review of products and practices to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the CFPB. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain, but it has resulted in, and could continue to result in, changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It has also resulted in, and could continue to result in, increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties.  

In addition, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers State Attorneys General and state regulators, under certain circumstances to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. If the CFPB or one or more State Attorneys General or state regulators believe that we have violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on us or our business. Since the CFPB filed its action against us in January of 2017, the Attorneys General of Illinois, Washington, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, California and New Jersey have filed separate actions alleging various violations of state and federal consumer protection laws.  

Loans serviced under the FFELP are subject to the HEA and related laws, rules, regulations and policies. Our servicing operations are designed and monitored to comply with the HEA, related regulations and program guidance; however, ED could determine that we are not in compliance for a variety of reasons, including that we misinterpreted ED guidance or incorrectly applied the HEA and its related laws, rules, regulations and policies. Failure to comply could result in fines, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on affected FFELP Loans, expenses required to cure servicing deficiencies, suspension or termination of our right to participate as a FFELP servicer, negative publicity and potential legal claims. The imposition of significant fines, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on a material number of FFELP Loans, the incurrence of additional expenses and/or the loss of our ability to participate as a FFELP servicer could individually or in the aggregate have a material, negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  

Our businesses are also subject to regulation and oversight by various state and federal agencies, particularly in the area of consumer protection, and are subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations. Several states have passed or proposed new student loan servicing rules or legislation and several other have imposed license requirements. Imposition of new laws, rules or regulations or the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, including litigation costs, and/or business sanctions including but not limited to termination or non-renewal of contracts.  

Expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of our businesses will increase our costs and risks.  

We are now, and may in the future be subject, to inquiries and audits from state and federal regulators as well as litigation from private plaintiffs. In recent years, we have entered into consent orders and other settlements. We have provided monetary and other relief in connection with the resolution of some of these actions and settlements. We have also enhanced our procedures and controls, expanded the risk and control functions within each line of business, invested in technology and hired additional risk, control and compliance personnel.  

If our risk and control procedures and processes fail to meet the heightened expectations of our regulators and other government agencies, we could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, provide additional monetary relief, or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our financial results.  

58 

We expect heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions to continue for us and for the financial services industry as a whole. Such actions can have significant consequences for a financial institution such as ours, including loss of customers and business and the inability to operate certain businesses.  

Further, legislative and regulatory responses to COVID-19 may have a significant impact on our education loan portfolios. In compliance with the CARES Act and related executive actions, payments and interest accrual on all loans owned by ED were suspended until September 30, 2021 and may be further suspended after such date. While the CARES Act applies only to loans owned by ED, several states have requested creditors and servicers to suspend payment obligations for other student loan borrowers in those states. Additionally, on March 25, 2020, ED announced that private collection agencies were required to stop making outbound collection calls and sending letters or billing statements to borrowers in default. In addition, in April 2020, various restrictions around the servicing and collection of consumer debts were enacted by certain states or voluntarily agreed to by many services, and some of these restrictions have been extended multiple times. The Company has announced that these practices are available to borrowers nationwide.  

Due to the uncertainty engendered by these new regulations, legislation, guidance and actions, coupled with the likelihood of additional changes or additions to the local, state and federal statutes, regulations and practices applicable to our business, we are not able to estimate the ultimate impact of changes in law on our financial results, business operations or strategies. We believe that the cost of responding to and complying with these evolving laws and regulations, as well as any guidance from enforcement actions, will continue to increase, as will the risk of penalties and fines from any enforcement actions that may be imposed on our businesses. Our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects could be materially and adversely affected as a result.  

GOVERNANCE RISK.  

Certain provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.  

Certain provisions of Delaware law and of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated by-laws are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by, among other things, encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate directly with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:  

•  

limitations on the ability of our shareholders to call a special meeting such that shareholder-requested special meetings will only be called upon the request of the holders of at least one-third of ours capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors;  

•  

rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;  

•  

the right of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without shareholder approval;  

•  

the inability of our shareholders to fill vacancies on our board of directors;  

•  

the requirement that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote thereon is required for shareholders to amend our amended and restated by-laws; and  

•  

the inability of our shareholders to cumulate their votes in the election of directors.  

In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation makes it subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 generally provides that, with limited exceptions, persons who acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the time at which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Being subject to Section 203 could cause a delay in or completely prevent a change of control that shareholders may favor.  

We believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our shareholders.  

Shareholders’ percentage ownership in Navient may be diluted in the future.  

In the future, shareholders’ percentage ownership in Navient may be diluted as a result of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including future equity awards that we may grant to our  

59 

directors, officers and employees. If made, these awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.  

In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors generally may determine the rights of preferred shareholders including their powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions. If our board were to approve the issuance of preferred stock in the future, the terms of one or more series of such preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all circumstances or upon the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, we could grant the preferred shareholders certain repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that could affect the value of the common stock.  

Our certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.  

Our certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our shareholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (DGCL) or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a shareholder in our company, holders of our common stock will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.  

REPUTATIONAL/POLITICAL RISK.  

Federal funding constraints and spending policy changes triggered by associated federal spending deadlines and ongoing lawmaker and regulatory efforts to change the student lending sector may result in disruption of federal payments for services we provide to the government, which could materially and adversely affect our business strategy or future business prospects.  

We receive payments from the federal government on our FFELP Loan portfolio and for other services it provides, including servicing loans under the Direct Student Loan Program (DSLP), providing default aversion and contingency collections to ED, and providing performance-based services to the IRS to support its national recovery program. Payments for these services may be affected by various factors, including the following:  

•  

The Budget Act enacted on December 26, 2013 requires that all servicing funding be provided through the annual appropriations process which is subject to certain limitations. Although the payments for our DSLP servicing contract are already funded from annual appropriations, the requirement to fund all servicing from the limited appropriated funding could have an effect on our future business in ways we cannot predict at this time.  

•  

Other Higher Education Legislation: As Congress and the current Administration consider the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, they may consider legislation that would reduce the payments to Guarantors or change the consolidation program in a way that would incentivize education loan borrowers to refinance their existing education loans, both private and federal. Such reforms could reduce our cash flows from servicing and interest income as well as our net interest margin.  

In June 2020, ED notified us that we were one of several entities selected to receive an award of a Next Generation (NextGen) Financial Services Business Process Outsourcing Contract. After careful analysis of the proposed contract and the differences between the proposed contract and the terms contained in the request for proposal, we determined that we could not accept the terms of the contract as presented and we notified ED of that decision. ED has canceled the NextGen Enhanced Procession Solution procurement and has suspended the NextGen Interim Servicing Solution procurement. We are currently servicing under our existing contract with ED with a period of performance that currently runs through June 2021, with ED having one remaining 6-month extension option. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 authorized the Secretary of Education to further extend any of the current servicing contracts for up to an additional two years after their currently scheduled expiration. However, at this time, we cannot predict whether any such extensions will occur or the nature or timing of the procurement process for replacement services. 

It is possible that the presidential administration and Congress in the future could engage in a debate linking the federal deficit, debt ceiling and other budget issues. If U.S. lawmakers in the future fail to reach agreement on these issues, the federal government could stop or delay payment on its obligations, including those on services we provide. Further, legislation to address the federal deficit and spending could impose proposals that would adversely affect FFELP and DSLP-related servicing businesses. A protracted reduction, suspension or cancellation of the  

60 

demand for the services we provide, or proposed changes to the terms or pricing of services provided under existing contracts with the federal government, including our contract with ED, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows, profitability and business outlook, and, as a result, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict how or what programs or policies will be impacted by any actions that the presidential administration, Congress or the federal government may take.  

Reputational risk and social factors may impact our results and damage our brand.  

Negative public opinion or damage to our brand could occur as a result of actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, security breaches (including the use and protection of customer information), corporate governance, and sales and marketing, and from actions taken by regulators or other persons. Such conduct could fall short of our customers’ and the public’s heightened expectations of companies of our size with rigorous data, privacy and compliance practices, and could further harm our reputation. In addition, third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us or the financial services industry. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the events discussed above will impact our reputation and business.  

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SPIN-OFF.  

Navient owes obligations, including service and indemnification obligations, to SLM BankCo under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Spin-Off. These obligations could be materially disruptive to Navient’s business or subject it to substantial liabilities, including contingent liabilities and liabilities that are presently unknown.  

In connection with the Spin-Off from SLM BankCo, Navient, SLM Corporation and SLM BankCo entered into various agreements.  

The separation and distribution agreement between Navient, SLM Corporation and SLM BankCo provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make Navient financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist whether incurred prior to or after the Spin-Off, relating to the business activities of SLM Corporation prior to the Spin-Off, other than those arising out of the consumer banking business and expressly assumed by SLM BankCo in the separation and distribution agreement. If Navient is required to indemnify SLM BankCo under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, Navient may be subject to substantial liabilities including liabilities that are accrued, contingent or otherwise and regardless of whether the liabilities were known or unknown at the time of the Spin-Off. SLM BankCo is party to various claims, litigation and legal, regulatory and other proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to its current and former operations. Previous business activities of SLM BankCo, including originations and acquisitions of various classes of consumer loans outside of Sallie Mae Bank, may also result in liability due to future laws, rules, interpretations or court decisions which purport to have retroactive effect, and such liability could be significant. SLM BankCo may also be subject to liabilities related to past activities of acquired businesses. It is inherently difficult, and in some cases impossible, to estimate the probable losses associated with contingent and unknown liabilities of this nature, but future losses may be substantial and may be borne by Navient in accordance with the terms of the separation and distribution agreement.  

STRATEGIC RISK.  

Legislation passed by Congress in 2010 ended new loan originations under the FFELP program and no new FFELP Loans are being originated, and, as a result, net income on our existing FFELP Loan portfolio is declining over time. We may not be able to develop revenue streams to fully replace the declining revenue from FFELP Loans.  

In 2010, Congress passed legislation ending the origination of education loans under the FFELP program. Since then, all federal education loans have been originated through the DSLP of the ED. While the 2010 law did not alter or affect the terms and conditions of existing FFELP Loans, it significantly impacted the education loan industry. As a result of this legislation, net income on our FFELP Loan portfolio is declining, and is anticipated to continue to decline, over time as those existing FFELP Loans are paid down, refinanced or repaid after default. 

Acquisitions or strategic investments that we pursue may not be successful and could harm our business and financial condition.  

Our growth strategy has included making opportunistic acquisitions of, or material investments in, loan portfolios and complementary businesses and products.  

All acquisitions of companies, operations or loan portfolios involve financial risks as well as operational risks. There may be additional risks if we enter into a line of business in which we have limited experience or which operates in a legal, regulatory or competitive environment with which we are not familiar. The expected benefits of acquisitions and investments also may not be realized for various reasons, including the loss of key personnel, customers or vendors.  

61 

If we fail to integrate or realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions or investments, we may lose the return on these acquisitions or investments or incur additional transaction costs, and our business and financial condition may be harmed as a result.  

GENERAL RISK FACTORS. 

Our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating the risk of loss.  

Our enterprise risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and returns. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, control and report the types of risk to which we are subject. We seek to monitor and control risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures, limits and reporting requirements. Management of risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. If the models we use to mitigate these risks are inadequate, we may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate risks, we could suffer unexpected losses, and our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  

We are subject to various legal proceedings and some of these legal proceedings or other contingencies may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results from operations.  

We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings in virtually every part of our business, including the legal proceedings described in the Legal Proceedings section of this Annual Report. While we believe we have adopted appropriate legal and risk management and compliance programs, the diverse nature of our operations, including operations of business we have recently acquired, means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. Some of these legal proceedings or other contingencies may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results from operations.  

Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our reported assets, liabilities, income, revenue or expenses.  

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenue or expenses during the reporting periods. Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management could adversely affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If we make incorrect assumptions or estimates, our reported financial results may be over or understated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

If we are unable to attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  

Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business. Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is very high. We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve our clients, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments, and grow and manage our business. As our business evolves, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained. If we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer.  

Our businesses operate in competitive environments and could lose market share and revenues if competitors compete more aggressively or effectively.  

We compete with for-profit and not-for-profit servicing, asset recovery and business processing businesses, many with strong records of performance. We compete based on price, effectiveness and customer service metrics. To the extent our competitors compete aggressively or more effectively than us, we could lose market share to them or Our service offerings may not prove to be profitable. Our business and financial condition may be harmed as a result.
