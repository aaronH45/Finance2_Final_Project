The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and the section titled “Forward-Looking Information is Subject to Risk and Uncertainty” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 ("Annual Report") for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Our Company

We are a world-leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers’ critical processes. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services supports global infrastructure industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management, as well as general industrial markets where our products and services add value. Through our manufacturing platform and global network of QRCs, we offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately 16,000 employees (“associates”) globally and a footprint of manufacturing facilities and Quick Response Centers in more than 50 countries.

Our business model is significantly influenced by the capital spending of global infrastructure industries for the placement of new products into service and maintenance spending for aftermarket services for existing operations. The worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue, where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes. We have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to drive customer investments in our offerings and use of our services to replace or repair installed products. The aftermarket portion of our business also helps provide business stability during various economic periods. The aftermarket business, which is primarily served by our network of 163 QRCs located around the globe, provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts, service solutions, product life cycle solutions and other value-added services. It is generally a higher margin business compared to our original equipment business and a key component of our profitable growth strategy. 

Our operations are conducted through two business segments that are referenced throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"):

•Flowserve Pump Division ("FPD") for custom, highly-engineered pumps, pre-configured industrial pumps, pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; and

•Flow Control Division ("FCD") for engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators and controls and related services. 

Our business segments share a focus on industrial flow control technology and have a high number of common customers. These segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications that provide us a net competitive advantage. Our segments also benefit from our global footprint, our 

30

economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively and shared leadership for operational support functions, such as research and development, marketing and supply chain. 

The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 50 well-respected brand names such as Worthington, IDP, Valtek, Limitorque, Durco, Argus, Edward, Valbart and Durametallic, which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry. Our products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than 10,000 companies, including some of the world’s leading engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users.

We continue to leverage our QRC network to be positioned as near to customers as possible for service and support in order to capture valuable aftermarket business. Along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell, install and service our equipment in remote regions, we continuously improve our global operations. Despite recent headwinds caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to enhance our global supply chain capability to increase our ability to meet global customer demands and improve the quality and timely delivery of our products over the long-term. Additionally, we continue to devote resources to improving the supply chain processes across our business segments to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to meet global customer demands. We also remain focused on improving on-time delivery and quality, while managing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations, through the assistance of a focused Continuous Improvement Process ("CIP") initiative. The goal of the CIP initiative, which includes lean manufacturing, six sigma business management strategy and value engineering, is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on-time delivery, reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity. 

COVID-19 Update

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an impact on human health, the global economy and society at large. The pandemic is expected to continue to adversely impact, for its duration, our operations and financial performance. In response, we continue to actively monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies. Our cross-functional crisis management team established during the first quarter of 2020 has continued monitoring and making recommendations to management to help us continue operating as an essential business across jurisdictions, while also protecting the health and safety of our associates.

Despite our evolving response, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our performance during the year, and we expect the impact will continue through at least the second quarter of 2021. While we cannot reasonably estimate with certainty the ongoing duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of any vaccine, or its ultimate impact on the global economy, our business or our financial condition and results, we nonetheless remain committed to providing the critical support, products and services that our customers rely on, and currently believe that we will emerge from these events well positioned for long-term growth.

Health and Safety of Our Associates

The health and safety of our associates, suppliers and customers around the world continues to be our first priority as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, including recent spikes in cases and returning work-from-home restrictions in various geographies in which we operate. We are incredibly proud of the great teamwork exhibited by our global workforce who have demonstrated strong resilience in adapting to continually evolving health and safety guidelines while addressing these challenging times and providing products and services to our customers.

We have implemented policies and practices to help protect our workforce so they can safely and effectively carry out their vital work, and we have continued to revise those policies and practices in light of guidance received from local and regional health authorities where appropriate. We instituted global restrictions on non-essential travel in March 2020 and the work-from-home policy for all non-essential employees who are able to do so has continued in effect in locations where health officials have advised such policies, including for our global headquarters in Irving, Texas, which will maintain its work-from-home policy at least through the second quarter of 2021. In those locations where employees are going to work in our facilities, we have continued taking steps, in light of guidelines from local and global health experts to protect our employees so that we can continue to manufacture critical technologies and equipment, including providing face coverings and other personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning of sites and implemented social distancing protocols. 

Our employees and facilities have a key role in keeping essential infrastructure and industries operating, including oil and gas, water, chemical, power generation and other essential industries, such as food and beverage and healthcare. While some of our facilities have experienced periods of temporary closures during 2020 in accordance with decrees, orders and laws in their respective countries and geographies, as of February 18, 2021, all of our facilities are open and operational, 

31

and are running close to pre-COVID-19 levels as we continue to make essential products and provide services for our customers. However, the measures described above, combined with continued employee costs and under-absorption of manufacturing costs as a result of temporary closures and work-from-home policies, have had and are expected to continue having an adverse impact on our financial performance throughout the remainder of the pandemic.

Customer Demand

During 2020 and into 2021 the reduction in global demand for oil and gas driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with excessive supply due to disagreements between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil producing nations in the first half of 2020, led to extreme volatility in global markets and in oil prices. These conditions have adversely impacted our customers, particularly in the oil and gas markets. For example, in the first half of 2020, these conditions drove a significant and broad-based decrease in customer planned capital spending, leading many of our large customers to announce double-digit capital expenditure budget decreases for the remainder of 2020. As a result, we saw overall bookings decline by approximately 20% during 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, resulting in a lower sequential backlog, though we have not seen a significant increase in the levels of customer cancellations in our existing backlog.

Additionally, the rapidly evolving impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and into 2021 have caused reduced activity levels in our aftermarket business due to deferred spending of our customers' repair and maintenance budgets, including the impact of restricted access to our customers' facilities. While we expect that these repair and maintenance projects will ultimately need to be completed, the timing will largely depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and how the virus and any variants continue to spread in our customers' various geographies.

These trends are likely to continue during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic as various actions implemented to combat the pandemic will continue to reduce demand for oil and gas. As a result, we have experienced decreased bookings, sales and financial performance and anticipate this continuing throughout the remainder of the pandemic. Additionally, we expect the headwinds in the oil and gas markets that have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, reduced capital expenditures and bookings for oil and gas customers to continue at least until oil demand and prices stabilize, which may not occur until after the pandemic subsides.

Supply Chain Impact

Since the onset of the pandemic, many of our suppliers have also experienced varying lengths of production and shipping conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which continue to exist in highly affected countries. These conditions have had an adverse effect on the speed at which we can manufacture and ship our products to customers, and have also led to an increase in logistics, transportation and freight costs, requiring that we diversify our supply chain and, in some instances, source materials from new suppliers. Additionally, these conditions have in some cases impacted our ability to deliver products to customers on time, which has in turn led to an increase in backlog at some of our manufacturing sites. Though some of these issues have abated in the second half of 2020 and into 2021 certain disruptions in our supply chain and their effects have continued through the year, and we expect they will continue as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. 

Operational Impacts

We have also engaged in a number of cost savings measures in order to help mitigate certain of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results, including certain realignment activities (further described below under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS"), a freeze on all non-essential open employment requisitions, cancellation of merit-based payroll increases for 2020, reduction of capital expenditures to approximately $60 million and cuts in other discretionary spending. Together, we planned for approximately $100 million of cost reductions, excluding realignment charges, in 2020 as compared to 2019, due in large part to our response to the effects of COVID-19, which partially offsets the increased costs and operational impacts of the safety protocols and procedures that we have implemented as described above under the heading "-Health and Safety of Our Associates." We continue to evaluate additional cost savings measures and will continue to implement such measures in the near term in order to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. 

We continue to monitor and assess the spread of COVID-19, including in areas that have seen recent increases in cases, and we will continue to adapt our operations to respond the changing conditions as needed. As we continue to manage our business through this unprecedented time of uncertainty and market volatility, we will remain focused on the 

32

health and safety of our associates, suppliers, customers, and will continue to provide essential products and services to our customers.

Our Markets 

Our products and services are used in several distinct industries: oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management, and several other industries, such as mining, steel and paper, that are collectively referred to as "general industries."

Oil and Gas 

The oil and gas industry, which represented approximately 34% and 41% of our bookings in 2020 and 2019, respectively, experienced a material decrease in capital spending in 2020 compared to the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to decreased project activity and short cycle investment resulting from the pandemic's negative impact on demand for refined products. Aftermarket opportunities in this industry also experienced a material decrease in 2020 due to deferred spending of our customers' repair and maintenance budgets and pandemic related challenges accessing our customers’ facilities. 

The outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the duration of the pandemic and its impact on fuel demand, demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies as well as changes in the regulatory environment. In the short-term, we believe that the pandemic will continue to negatively impact our customers’ capital investment and maintenance budgets. We further believe improved and stable oil prices provide support for increased demand for our aftermarket products and services. We believe the medium and long-term fundamentals for this industry remain attractive and see a stabilized environment with expected increased fuel demand on improved pandemic management, and as the industry works through current excess supply. In addition, we believe projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long-term demand growth will require additional investments. With our long-standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream, mid-stream and downstream applications, along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned to assist our customers in this improving environment. 

Chemical 

The chemical industry represented approximately 24% and 22% of our bookings in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The chemical industry is comprised of petrochemical, specialty chemical and pharmaceutical products. Capital spending in 2020 decreased materially primarily due to the pandemic's negative impact on demand for chemical products. The aftermarket opportunities also materially decreased in 2020 due to deferred spending of our customers' repair and maintenance budgets and pandemic related challenges accessing our customers’ facilities.

The outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions. As global economies and unemployment conditions improve, a rise in consumer spending should follow. An increase in spending would drive greater demand for petrochemical, specialty chemical and pharmaceutical products supporting improved levels of capital investment. We believe the chemical industry will continue to invest in North America and Middle East capacity additions, maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will selectively invest in capital infrastructure to meet current and future indigenous demand. We believe our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well-positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry.

Power Generation 

The power generation industry represented approximately 13% and 11% of our bookings in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, the power generation industry continued to experience softness in thermal power generation capital spending in the mature and key developing markets. China continued to curtail the construction of new coal-fired power generation over the last year, while in India and southeast Asia capital investment remained in place driven by increased demand forecasts.

Natural gas-fired combined cycle (“NGCC”) plants increased their share of the energy mix, driven by market prices for gas remaining low and stable (partially due to the increasing global availability of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”)), low capital expenditures, and the ability of NGCC to stabilize unpredictable renewable sources. With the potential of unconventional sources of gas, the global power generation industry is forecasting an increased use of this form of fuel for power generation plants.

33

Despite fewer new nuclear plants being constructed in recent years, nuclear power remains an important contributor to the global energy mix. We continue to support our significant installed base in the global nuclear fleet by providing aftermarket and life extension products and services. Due to our extensive history, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this ongoing source of aftermarket and new construction opportunities.

Political efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have some adverse effect on thermal power investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country. However, many proposed methods of capturing and limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services. At the same time, we continue to take advantage of new investments in concentrated solar power generating capacity, where our pumps, valves, and seals are uniquely positioned for both molten salt applications as well as the traditional steam cycle. 

We believe the long-term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth, growth of urbanization in developing markets and the increased use of electricity driven transportation. We also believe that our long-standing reputation in the power generation industry, our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods, our advancements in serving the renewable energy market and carbon capture methodologies, as well as our global service and support structure, position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry.

Water Management 

The water management industry represented approximately 3% and 4% of our bookings in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Water management industry activity levels decreased in 2020 primarily due to the pandemic's negative impact on government budgets across the globe. Worldwide demand for fresh water, water treatment and re-use, desalination and flood control are expected to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems, many of which require products that we offer, particularly pumps. With improved management of the pandemic, we expect capital and aftermarket spending to rise in developed and emerging markets with governments and private industry providing funding for critical projects when their priorities shift away from pandemic-management.

 The proportion of people living in regions that find it difficult to meet water requirements is expected to double by 2025. We believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continued investments, especially in North America and developing regions.

General Industries 

General industries represented, in the aggregate, approximately 26% and 22% of our bookings in 2020 and 2019, respectively. General industries comprise a variety of different businesses, including mining and ore processing, pulp and paper, food and beverage and other smaller applications, none of which individually represented more than 5% of total bookings in 2020 and 2019. General industries also include sales to distributors, whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve. Sales to distributors in 2020 were negatively impacted by decreased upstream oil and gas activity in North America.

The outlook for this group of industries is heavily dependent upon the condition of global economies and consumer confidence levels. The long-term fundamentals of many of these industries remain sound, as many of the products produced by these industries are common staples of industrialized and urbanized economies. We believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide continued business opportunities.

Outlook for 2021 

As the headwinds experienced during the year continue to impact our business, we experienced approximately a 20% decline in bookings as compared to the same period in 2019, with less of an impact on revenue, which declined approximately 5% as compared to the same period in 2019. We anticipate further pressure on revenue with a year over year decline of approximately 4% to 7% in 2021 as a result of lower bookings in 2020, resulting in lower customer backlog as we enter 2021. Despite these effects, however, we expect to maintain adequate liquidity over the next 12 months as we manage through the current market environment. We will continue to actively monitor the potential impacts of COVID-19 and related events on the credit markets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity and access to capital throughout 2021. 

Our future results of operations and other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties — in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross profit margin 

34

and costs, capital spending, expected cost savings from our transformation and realignment programs, global economic and political risk, depreciation and amortization, research and development expenses, potential impairment of assets, tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings. Our future results of operations may also be affected by employee incentive compensation including our annual program and the amount, type and valuation of share-based awards granted, as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" as well as the section titled “Forward-Looking Information is Subject to Risk and Uncertainty” of this Annual Report.

Our bookings were $3,411.6 million during 2020. Because a booking represents a contract that can be, in certain circumstances, modified or canceled, and can include varying lengths between the time of booking and the time of revenue recognition, there is no guarantee that bookings will result in comparable revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results. 

On December 31, 2020, we had $1,701.5 million of fixed-rate Senior Notes outstanding. We expect our interest expense in 2021 will be modestly higher compared with amounts incurred in 2020. Our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” of this Annual Report. 

We expect to generate sufficient cash from operations and have sufficient capacity under our Senior Credit Facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt payments and pension plan contributions in 2021. The amount of cash generated or consumed by working capital is dependent on our level of revenues, customer cash advances, backlog, customer-driven delays and other factors. We will seek to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory. In 2021, our cash flows for investing activities will be focused on strategic initiatives, information technology infrastructure, general upgrades and cost reduction opportunities and we currently estimate capital expenditures to be between $70 million and $80 million, before consideration of any acquisition activity. 

We currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plan will be approximately $20 million, excluding direct benefits paid, in 2021 in order to maintain fully-funded status as defined by applicable law. We currently anticipate that our contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $2 million in 2021, excluding direct benefits paid.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Throughout this discussion of our results of operations, we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have calculated currency effects on operations by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods. 

In October 2020, we entered into a settlement agreement with two insurance companies providing coverage for one of our heritage companies. Given the size of the settlement, and as part of the third quarter close process, we re-evaluated our accounting for asbestos-related matters and evaluated the amount of receivables that were currently recorded. We made certain adjustments primarily related to an incurred but not reported ("IBNR") liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims, but also included adjustments related to the associated receivables for expected insurance proceeds for asbestos settlement and defense costs from insurance coverage and the recognition as an expense the related legal fees that were previously estimated to be recoverable from insurance carriers for which coverage is not currently sufficient following the recognition of the IBNR for periods beginning with the year ended December 31, 2014 through the second quarter of 2020 and to correct certain other previously identified immaterial errors. These errors, individually and in the aggregate, are not material to any prior annual or interim period. However, the aggregate amount of the prior period errors would have been material to our quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2020 and the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and therefore we have revised our previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.

Realignment Activity

In the second quarter of 2018, we launched and committed resources to our Flowserve 2.0 Transformation, a program designed to transform our business model to drive operational excellence, reduce complexity, accelerate growth, 

35

improve organizational health and better leverage our existing global platform, which is further discussed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We anticipate that the Flowserve 2.0 Transformation will result in further restructuring charges, non-restructuring charges and other related transformation expenses. The Flowserve 2.0 Transformation expenses incurred primarily consist of professional services, project management and related travel costs recorded in SG&A expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred Flowserve 2.0 Transformation related expenses of $22.7 million and $28.0 million, respectively. 

In the second quarter of 2020, we identified and initiated certain realignment activities resulting from our Flowserve 2.0 Transformation Program to right-size our organizational operations based on the current business environment, with the overall objective to reduce our workforce costs. We anticipate a total investment in 2020 Realignment Program activities of approximately $80 million and that the majority of the charges were incurred in 2020 with the remainder to be incurred in early 2021. Based on actions initiated in 2020, we estimate that we have achieved cost savings of approximately $41 million as of December 31, 2020, with approximately $16 million of those savings in COS and approximately $25 million SG&A. Upon completion of the 2020 Realignment Program activities, we expect full year run-rate cost savings of approximately $100 million. Actual savings could vary from expected savings, which represent management’s best estimate to date. There are certain other realignment activities that are currently being evaluated, but have not yet been finalized. The realignment programs initiated in 2015 ("2015 Realignment Programs"), which consisted of both restructuring and non-restructuring charges, were substantially complete as of March 31, 2020, resulting in $362.4 million of total charges incurred through the completion of the programs.

The total charges incurred in 2020 related to our 2020 Realignment Program activities and Flowserve 2.0 Transformation by segment and the charges incurred in 2019 related to our 2015 Realignment Programs and Flowserve 2.0 Transformation by segment are presented in the following tables: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Bookings and Backlog

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

36

We define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer in regard to the manufacture, delivery, and/or support of products or the delivery of service. Bookings recorded and subsequently canceled within the same fiscal period are excluded from reported bookings. Bookings of $3.4 billion in 2020 decreased by $826.7 million, or 19.5%, as compared with 2019. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $24 million. The decrease was driven by lower bookings in the oil and gas, chemical, general, power generation and water management industries. Customer bookings were down significantly in both aftermarket and original equipment, which have decreased in light of the impacts of COVID-19 on customer spending and distressed oil prices on these industries. 

Bookings of $4.2 billion in 2019 increased by $218.5 million, or 5.4%, as compared with 2018. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $108 million. The increase was primarily driven by customer original equipment bookings. The increase was driven by higher bookings in the oil and gas, power generation, chemical and water management industries, partially offset by decreased bookings in the general industries. Bookings in 2018 included approximately $31 million related to the two FPD locations and associated product lines that were divested in the third quarter of 2018. 

Backlog represents the aggregate value of booked but uncompleted customer orders and is influenced primarily by bookings, sales, cancellations and currency effects. Backlog of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2020 decreased by $302.1 million, or 14.0%, as compared with December 31, 2019. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $54 million (currency effects on backlog are calculated using the change in period end exchange rates). Backlog related to aftermarket orders was approximately 36% and 33% of the backlog at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately 90% of December 31, 2020 backlog during 2021. Backlog includes our unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations related to contracts having an original expected duration in excess of one year of approximately $541 million as discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

Backlog of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2019 increased by $265.4 million, or 14.0%, as compared with December 31, 2018. Currency effects provided an increase of less than $1 million (currency effects on backlog are calculated using the change in period end exchange rates). Backlog related to aftermarket orders was approximately 33% and 36% of the backlog at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expected to recognize revenue on approximately 88% of December 31, 2019 backlog during 2020.

Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales in 2020 decreased by $211.6 million, or 5.4%, as compared with 2019. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $17 million. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by aftermarket sales, with decreased sales into North America, Europe, Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by increased sales into the Middle East.  

Sales in 2019 increased by $104.0 million, or 2.7%, as compared with 2018. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $94 million. The increase was more heavily-weighted to aftermarket sales, with increased sales into North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, partially offset by decreased sales into Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. Sales in 2018 included approximately $30 million related to the two FPD locations and associated product lines that were divested in the third quarter of 2018. 

Sales to international customers, including export sales from the U.S., were approximately 65% of total sales in 2020 and 63% in both 2019 and 2018. Sales into Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMA") were approximately 33% of total sales in 2020, 32% in both 2019 and 2018. Sales into Asia Pacific were approximately 22% of total sales for 2020, 21% for 2019 and 20% for 2018. Sales into Latin America were approximately 6% of total sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin

37

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Gross profit in 2020 decreased by $172.5 million, or 13.4%, as compared with 2019. Gross profit margin in 2020 of 30.0% decreased from 32.7% in 2019. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to a sales mix shift to lower margin original equipment sales, revenue recognized on lower margin original equipment orders as compared to the same period in 2019, increased realignment charges associated with our 2020 Realignment Program and the unfavorable impact of underutilized capacity from the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in $15.0 million of manufacturing costs being expensed and other related costs, partially offset by increased savings related to our 2020 Realignment Program. Aftermarket sales represented approximately 49% of total sales, as compared with approximately 50% of total sales for the same period in 2019. 

Gross profit in 2019 increased by $98.4 million, or 8.3%, as compared with 2018. Gross profit margin in 2019 of 32.7% increased from 31.0% in 2018. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to the favorable impact of revenue recognized on higher margin projects, lower realignment charges associated with our Realignment Programs, improvements in operational efficiency and a $7.7 million charge related to the write-down of inventory in the second quarter of 2018 that did not recur. Aftermarket sales represented approximately 50% of total sales in both 2019 and 2018. 

SG&A

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SG&A in 2020 decreased by $35.0 million, or 3.8%, as compared with 2019. Currency effects yielded a decrease of approximately $1 million. In 2020, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points as compared with the same period in 2019. The decrease in in SG&A, including currency, was due to a decrease in travel and selling-related expenses and increased savings related to our 2020 Realignment Program, partially offset by increased charges related to our 2020 Realignment Program as compared to the same period in 2019 and an $8.5 million write-down of accounts receivables and contract assets related to a contract with an oil and gas customer in Latin America during the first quarter of 2020.

SG&A in 2019 increased by $53.4 million, or 5.5%, as compared with 2018. Currency effects yielded a decrease of approximately $18 million. In 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 200 basis points as compared with the same period in 2018 primarily due to lower charges related to our Flowserve 2.0 Transformation and Realignment Programs, decreased broad-based annual incentive compensation expense, gains from the sales of non-strategic manufacturing facilities during the year, favorable impacts resulting from the 2018 divestiture of two FPD locations and a $9.7 million impairment charge related to long-lived assets in the second quarter of 2018 that did not recur.

Loss on Sale of Business

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The loss on sale of business in 2018 of $7.7 million resulted from the divestiture of two FPD locations and related product lines. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on this sale.

Net Earnings from Affiliates

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net earnings from affiliates represents our net income from investments in six joint ventures (one located in each of Chile, China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates) that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Net earnings from affiliates in 2020 increased by $1.3 million, or 12.4%, as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased earnings of our FPD joint venture in South Korea. Net earnings from affiliates in 2019 decreased by $0.6 million, or 5.4%, as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of decreased earnings of our FPD joint venture in India. 

Operating Income

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating income in 2020 decreased by $136.3 million, or 35.3%, as compared with 2019. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $9 million. The decrease was primarily a result of the $172.5 million decrease in gross profit, partially offset by the $35.0 million decrease in SG&A. 

Operating income in 2019 increased by $158.9 million, or 69.8%, as compared with 2018. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $12 million. The increase was primarily as result of the $98.4 million increase in gross profit driven primarily by reduced demand and other impacts of the pandemic, as well as reduced oil prices, the $53.4 million decrease in SG&A and the loss of $7.7 million from the divestiture of two FPD locations and related product lines in the third quarter of 2018 that did not recur.

Interest Expense and Interest Income

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest expense in 2020 increased by $2.4 million as compared with 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to interest expense associated with the senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2020, partially offset by the net impact of our partial tender of our 1.250% EUR Senior Notes due 2022 ("2022 Euro Senior Notes"). Interest income in 2020 decreased by $4.2 million as compared to 2019. The decrease in interest income was partially due to lower interest rates on our average cash balances compared with same period in 2019. 

Interest expense in 2019 decreased by $3.2 million as compared with 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower borrowings in 2019 and currency impacts on interest expense associated with our outstanding Euro-denominated senior notes, as compared to the same period in 2018. Interest income in 2019 increased by $1.9 million as compared to 2018. The increase in interest income was primarily attributed to higher average cash balances compared with same period in 2018. 

Other Income (Expense), net

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

39

Other expense, net decreased $7.3 million as compared to 2019, due to a $12.4 million increase in gains from transactions in currencies other than our sites' functional currencies, partially offset by a $3.8 million increase in losses from foreign exchange contracts. The net change was primarily due to the foreign currency exchange rate movements in the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Euro and Brazilian real in relation to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with the same period in 2019.

Other expense, net decreased $2.0 million in 2019, due to a $7.6 million decrease in losses from transactions in currencies other than our sites' functional currencies, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in losses from foreign exchange contracts. The net change was primarily due to the foreign currency exchange rate movements in the Euro, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar and Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period in 2018.

Tax Expense and Tax Rate

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our effective tax rate of 32.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased from 23.4% in 2019 primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets given the current and anticipated impact to the Company's operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the distressed oil prices. The 2020 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance described above. The 2019 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state tax and foreign audit assessments, partially offset by the net impact of foreign operations. The 2018 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, including losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was provided. 

Our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings and estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location. Changes in any of these and other factors, including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses or results from tax audits, could impact the tax rate in future periods. As of December 31, 2020, we have foreign tax credits of $35.9 million, expiring in 2026 and 2028-2030 tax years, against which we recorded a valuation allowance of $35.9 million. Additionally, we have recorded other net deferred tax assets of $30.5 million, which relate to net operating losses, tax credits and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods, most of which do not have a definite expiration. Should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses, our effective tax rate would increase.

Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net earnings in 2020 decreased by $122.5 million to $116.3 million, or to $0.89 per diluted share, as compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income of $136.3 million and a $6.6 million increase in interest expense, net, partially offset by a $7.3 million decrease in other expense, net and a $15.5 million decrease in tax expense. 

Net earnings in 2019 increased by $134.3 million to $238.8 million, or to $1.81 per diluted share, as compared with 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income of $158.9 million, a $2.0 million decrease in other expense, net and a $5.1 million decrease in interest expense, net, partially offset by a $28.9 million increase in tax expense.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Other comprehensive income (loss) in 2020 decreased by $0.8 million from a loss of $9.8 million in 2019. The decreased loss was primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting primarily from exchange rate movements of the Euro, Chinese yuan, British pound and Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2020 as compared with 2019. 

Other comprehensive income (loss) in 2019 decreased by $58.0 million as compared with 2018. The decreased loss was primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting primarily from exchange rate movements of the Euro, British pound, Chinese yuan and Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2019 as compared with 2018. 

Business Segments

We conduct our operations through two business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment’s operating income. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our segments. The key operating results for our two business segments, FPD and FCD, are discussed below.

Flowserve Pump Division Segment Results

Our largest business segment is FPD, through which we design, manufacture, pre-test, distribute and service specialty and highly-engineered custom and pre-configured pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals and auxiliary systems (collectively referred to as "original equipment"). FPD includes longer lead time, highly-engineered pump products and mechanical seals that are generally manufactured within shorter lead times. FPD also manufactures replacement parts and related equipment and provides aftermarket services. FPD primarily operates in the oil and gas, petrochemical, chemical, power generation, water management and general industries. FPD operates in 48 countries with 39 manufacturing facilities worldwide, 13 of which are located in Europe, 12 in North America, eight in Asia Pacific and six in Latin America, and we have 137 QRCs, including those co-located in manufacturing facilities and/or shared with FCD.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Bookings in 2020 decreased by $649.5 million, or 21.6%, as compared with 2019. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $20 million. The decrease in customer bookings was driven by decreased orders in the oil and gas, chemical, power generation and general industries. Decreased customer bookings of $288.0 million into North America, $146.8 million into the Middle East, $79.9 million into Asia Pacific, $68.1 million into Europe, $39.1 million into Africa and $21.6 million into Latin America. The decrease in customer bookings was primarily driven by customer original equipment bookings which have decreased in light of the impacts of COVID-19 on customer spending and distressed oil prices on these industries. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated 

41

bookings as disclosed above) increased $3.1 million. Of the $2.4 billion of bookings in 2020, approximately 37% were from oil and gas, 27% from general industries, 20% from chemical, 12% from power generation and 4% from water management. 

 Bookings in 2019 increased by $254.4 million, or 9.2%, as compared with 2018. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $79 million. Bookings in 2018 included approximately $31 million related to the two FPD locations and associated product lines that were divested in the third quarter of 2018. The increase in customer bookings was primarily driven by the oil and gas, chemical and power generation industries, partially offset by decreased bookings in the general industries. Increased customer bookings of $100.4 million into North America, $78.1 million into the Middle East, $72.1 million into Asia Pacific, $18.6 million in Latin America and $11.5 million into Africa, were partially offset by decreased customer bookings of $49.9 million into Europe. The increase was primarily driven by customer original equipment bookings. Of the $3.0 billion of bookings in 2019, approximately 44% were from oil and gas, 22% from general industries, 19% from chemical, 10% from power generation and 5% from water management. 

Sales in 2020 decreased $30.6 million, or 1.1%, as compared with 2019. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $19 million. The decrease was driven by aftermarket sales, resulting from decreased customer sales of $43.6 million into North America, $16.3 million into Africa, $13.5 million into Europe and $10.2 million into Latin America, partially offset by increased sales of $39.4 million into Asia Pacific and $20.7 million into the Middle East. 

Sales in 2019 increased $83.0 million, or 3.2%, as compared with 2018. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $66 million. Sales in 2018 included approximately $30 million related to the two FPD locations and associated product lines that were divested in the third quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily driven by aftermarket sales, resulting from increased customer sales of $45.3 million into North America, $28.6 million into Europe, $16.8 million into the Middle East and $8.8 million into Africa, partially offset by decreased sales of $17.8 million into Latin America and $4.0 million into Asia Pacific. 

Gross profit in 2020 decreased by $87.9 million, or 9.8%, as compared with 2019. Gross profit margin in 2020 of 30.3% decreased from 33.2% in 2019. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to a sales mix shift to lower margin original equipment sales as compared to the same period in 2019, the increased charges related to our 2020 Realignment Program and the unfavorable impact of underutilized capacity from the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in $9.2 million of manufacturing costs being expensed and other related costs, partially offset by increased savings related to our 2020 Realignment Program. 

Gross profit in 2019 increased by $123.6 million, or 15.9%, as compared with 2018. Gross profit margin in 2019 of 33.2% increased from 29.6% in 2018. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to revenue recognized on higher margin projects, lower realignment charges associated with our Realignment Programs, sales mix shift to higher margin aftermarket sales, improvements in operational efficiency and a $7.7 million charge related to the write-down of inventory in the second quarter of 2018 that did not recur. 

SG&A in 2020 decreased by $14.1 million, or 2.5%, as compared with 2019. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $1 million. The decrease in SG&A, including currency, was due to favorable impacts on SG&A due to a decrease in travel and selling-related expenses, increased savings related to our 2020 Realignment Program as compared to the same period in 2019 and the favorable impacts resulting from gains from the sales of non-strategic manufacturing facilities in the first quarter of 2019 that did not recur, partially offset by an $8.5 million write-down of accounts receivables and contract assets related to a contract with an oil and gas customer in Latin America during the first quarter of 2020.

SG&A in 2019 decreased by $12.6 million, or 2.2%, as compared with 2018. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $13 million. The decrease in SG&A, including currency, was due to favorable impacts on SG&A due to gains from the sales of non-strategic manufacturing facilities during the year, the 2018 divestiture of two FPD locations and a $9.7 million impairment charge related to the long-lived assets in the second quarter of 2018 that did not recur, partially offset by an increase in selling-related expenses and collections of previously reserved bad debts in 2018 that did not recur. 

The loss on sale of business in 2018 of $7.7 million resulted from the divestiture of two FPD locations and related product lines. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on this sale. 

Operating income in 2020 decreased by $72.5 million, or 21.1%, as compared with 2019. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $9 million. The decrease was due to the $87.9 million decrease in gross profit, partially offset by the $14.1 million decrease in SG&A. 

42

Operating income in 2019 increased by $142.5 million, or 70.9%, as compared with 2018. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $10 million. The increase was due to the $123.6 million increase in gross profit, the $12.6 million decrease in SG&A and the $7.7 million loss from the divestiture of two FPD locations and related product lines in the third quarter of 2018 that did not recur. 

Backlog of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 decreased by $324.0 million, or 20.8%, as compared with December 31, 2019. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $36 million.  Backlog of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2019 increased by $274.7 million, or 21.4%, as compared with December 31, 2018. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $5 million.

We believe that FCD is the second largest industrial valve supplier in the world.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Bookings in 2020 decreased $175.1 million, or 14.1%, as compared with 2019. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $3.4 million. The decrease was driven by lower bookings in the oil and gas, general, chemical and power generation industries. Decreased customer bookings of $140.9 million into North America, $33.4 million into Europe, $20.4 million into the Middle East and $9.0 million into Africa, were partially offset by increased bookings of $17.5 million into Asia Pacific and $6.7 million into Latin America. The decrease was more heavily weighted towards original equipment bookings. Of the $1.1 billion of bookings in 2020, approximately 31% were from chemical, 29% were from oil and gas, 25% from general industries and 15% from power generation. 

Bookings in 2019 decreased $33.4 million, or 2.6%, as compared with 2018. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $29 million. The decrease in customer bookings in the general and chemical industries were partially offset by increases in the power generation, oil and gas and water management industries. Decreased customer bookings of $27.3 million into North America, $8.2 million into Asia Pacific and $2.6 million into Europe were partially offset by increased bookings of $24.1 million into the Middle East. The decrease was more heavily weighted towards customer aftermarket bookings. Of the $1.2 billion of bookings in 2019, approximately 34% were from oil and gas, 29% from chemical, 24% from general industries and 13% from power generation.

Sales in 2020 decreased by $181.4 million, or 14.6%, as compared with 2019. The decrease included currency benefits of approximately $1 million and was primarily driven by decreased customer original equipment sales. Sales decreased $113.9 million into North America, $45.9 million into Asia Pacific, $32.0 million into Europe and $2.6 million into Latin America and were partially offset by increased customer sales of $8.8 million into the Middle East and $2.7 million into Africa. 

Sales in 2019 increased by $20.1 million, or 1.6%, as compared with 2018. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $28 million and was driven by increased customer original equipment sales. Sales increased $40.2 

43

million into Asia Pacific, $17.6 million into Europe, $6.5 million into Latin America and $3.5 million into North America and were partially offset by decreased customer sales of $23.5 million into the Middle East and $15.9 million into Africa. 

Gross profit in 2020 decreased by $83.6 million, or 20.6%, as compared with 2019. Gross profit margin in 2020 of 30.4% decreased from 32.7% in 2019. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower sales volume and revenue recognized on lower margin original equipment orders as compared to the same period in 2019, increased charges related to our 2020 Realignment Program and the unfavorable impact of underutilized capacity from the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in $5.8 million of manufacturing costs and other related costs being expensed, partially offset by increased savings related to our 2020 Realignment Program.

 Gross profit in 2019 decreased by $14.4 million, or 3.4%, as compared with 2018. Gross profit margin in 2019 of 32.7% decreased from 34.5% in 2018. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to a mix shift to more original equipment sales and revenue recognized on lower margin original equipment orders as compared to the same period in 2018. 

SG&A in 2020 decreased by $17.3 million, or 8.1% as compared with 2019. Currency effects provided a decrease of less than $1 million. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to increased savings related to our 2020 Realignment Program as compared to the same period in 2019 and a decrease in travel and selling-related expenses from our cost saving initiatives in response to COVID-19. 

SG&A in 2019 decreased by $1.4 million, or 0.7% as compared with 2018. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $4 million. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to currency effects as compared to 2018.

Operating income in 2020 decreased by $66.3 million, or 34.5%, as compared with 2019. The decrease included negative currency effects of less than $1 million. The decrease was primarily due to the $83.6 million decrease in gross profit, partially offset by the decrease in SG&A of $17.3 million. 

Operating income in 2019 decreased by $12.3 million, or 6.0%, as compared with 2018. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $3 million. The decrease was primarily due to the $14.4 million decrease in gross profit, partially offset by the decrease in SG&A of $1.4 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flow Analysis

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Existing cash, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our senior credit facility are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our total cash balance at December 31, 2020 was $1,095.3 million, compared with $671.0 million at December 31, 2019 and $619.7 million at December 31, 2018.

Our cash provided by operating activities was $310.5 million, $324.1 million and $190.8 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which provided cash to support short-term working capital needs. Cash flow provided by working capital increased in 2020 due primarily to cash provided by lower accounts receivable of $45.6 million, higher accrued liabilities and income taxes payable of $50.2 million, lower inventory of $15.3 million and lower contract assets, net of $4.3 million, partially offset by cash used by lower accounts payable of $22.6 million and lower contract liabilities of $34.1 

44

million. Cash flow used by working capital increased in 2019 due primarily to cash used by higher contract assets of $45.2 million, higher inventory of $31.1 million, lower accounts receivables of $2.9 million and lower accrued liabilities and income taxes payable of $12.4 million, partially offset by cash provided by higher contract liabilities of $19.7 million. During 2020, we contributed $15.9 million to our defined benefit pension plans as compared to $37.3 million in 2019. 

Decreases in accounts receivable provided $45.6 million and $2.9 million of cash flow in 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared with cash flow used of $25.4 million in 2018.  For the fourth quarter of 2020 our days' sales outstanding ("DSO") was 69 days as compared to 67 days for 2019 and 72 days for 2018. We have not experienced a significant increase in customer payment defaults in 2020.

Decreases in inventory provided $15.3 million of cash flow in 2020, as compared with cash used of $31.1 million and $29.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The cash used from inventory in 2019 was due to an increase in raw materials and work in process. Inventory turns were 4.1 times at December 31, 2020, as compared with 4.3 times for 2019 and 4.2 times for 2018. Our calculation of inventory turns does not reflect the impact of advanced cash received from our customers. 

Decreases in contract assets provided $4.3 million of cash flow and decreases in contact liabilities used $34.1 million of cash flow in 2020. Increases in contract assets used $45.2 million of cash flow and increases in contact liabilities provided $19.7 million of cash flow in 2019. 

Decreases in accounts payable used $22.6 million of cash flow in 2020 compared with cash provided of $24.7 million and $7.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Increases in accrued liabilities and income taxes payable provided $50.2 million of cash flow in 2020 compared to $12.4 million 2019 and cash used of $15.2 million in 2018.

Cash used by investing activities were $41.7 million in 2020, as compared to $33.4 million and $81.5 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of cash used in 2020 was primarily due to lower proceeds provided from the disposal of assets during the year of $13.8 million, compared to $42.3 million in 2019. Capital expenditures were $57.4 million, $75.7 million and $84.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2021, we currently estimate capital expenditures to be between $70 million and $80 million, before consideration of any acquisition activity. 

Cash provided by financing activities were $147.6 million in 2020 compared to cash flow used of $231.5 million and $173.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash inflows during 2020 resulted primarily from the $498.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes due October 1, 2030 ("2030 Senior Notes"), partially offset by a $191.3 million in payments on long-term debt resulting from our partial tender offer of our 2022 Euro Senior Notes, $104.2 million of dividend payments and the repurchase of $15.0 million of our common stock. Cash outflows during 2019 resulted primarily from $105.0 million in payments on long-term debt and $99.6 million of dividend payments. Cash outflows during 2018 resulted primarily from $99.4 million of dividend payments and $60.0 million in payments on long-term debt. On February 17, 2021, we announced that we will redeem the outstanding balance of our 2022 Euro Senior Notes on March 19, 2021. We will use the remaining net proceeds from the public offering of the 2030 Senior Notes for the redemption. 

 In 2020 we repurchased 1,057,115 shares of our outstanding common stock for $32.1 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had $113.6 million of remaining capacity under our share repurchase plan previously approved by the Board of Directors. 

Our cash needs for the next 12 months, including for our estimated 2021 capital expenditures described above, are expected to be lower than those of 2020 due to anticipated benefits from working capital reductions and savings from 2020 Realignment Program, discussed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We believe cash flows from operating activities, combined with availability under our senior credit facility and our existing cash balances, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by a continued decrease in the rate of general global economic growth and an extended decrease in capital spending of our customers, as well as economic, political and other risks associated with sales of our products, operational factors, competition, regulatory actions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates, among other factors. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our credit agreements are also sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for periods beyond the next 12 months.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise economical capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation.

Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report contains a discussion of our disposition activity.

Financing

Our credit agreement provides for a $800.0 million unsecured senior credit facility with a maturity date of July 16, 2024 (“Senior Credit Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility includes a $750.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $30.0 million sublimit for swing line loans. We have the right to increase the amount of the Senior Credit Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed $400.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the lenders under our Senior Credit Facility of any such increase. 

The interest rates per annum applicable to the Senior Credit Facility (other than with respect to swing line loans) are LIBOR plus between 1.000% to 1.750%, depending on our debt rating by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s ("S&P") Ratings, or, at our option, the Base Rate (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) plus between 0.000% to 0.750% depending on our debt rating by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings. At December 31, 2020 the interest rate on the Senior Credit Facility was LIBOR plus 1.375% in the case of LIBOR loans and the Base Rate plus 0.375% in the case of Base Rate loans. In addition, a commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears on the daily unused portions of the Senior Credit Facility. The commitment fee will be between 0.090% and 0.300% of unused amounts under the Senior Credit Facility depending on our debt rating by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings. Certain financing arrangements contain provisions that may result in an event of default if there was a failure under other financing arrangements to meet payment terms. Such provisions are referred to as "cross default" provisions. A discussion of our debt and related covenants is included in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We were in compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2020.

 Liquidity Analysis

Our cash balance increased by $424.3 million to $1,095.3 million as of December 31, 2020 as compared with December 31, 2019. The cash increase included $310.5 million in operating cash inflows, $498.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes due October 1, 2030 ("2030 Senior Notes") and $13.8 million from the sale of non-strategic manufacturing facilities that are included in our Realignment Programs, partially offset by $191.3 million in payments on long-term debt, $104.2 million in dividend payments, $57.4 million in capital expenditures and the repurchase of $32.1 million of our common stock. Proceeds received during 2019 included $42.3 million of proceeds from the sale of non-strategic manufacturing facilities that were included in our 2015 Realignment Programs.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, as a result of the values of the plan’s assets and our contributions to the plan, our U.S. pension plan was fully-funded as defined by applicable law. After consideration of our funded status, we elected to make no contributions attributable to the U.S. pension plan in 2020. As of December 31, 2020 direct benefits paid by the U.S. pension plan were less than $1.0 million. We continue to maintain an asset allocation consistent with our strategy to maximize total return, while reducing portfolio risks through asset class diversification. 

COVID-19 Liquidity Update

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1,837 million of liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $1,095 million and $742 million of borrowings available under our Senior Credit Facility. In light of the liquidity currently available to us, and the costs savings measures planned and already in place, we expect to be able to maintain adequate liquidity over the next 12 months as we manage through the current market environment. We will continue to actively monitor the potential impacts of COVID-19 and related events on the credit markets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity and access to capital throughout 2020.

We expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS

Plan Descriptions

We and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 62% of total defined benefit pension plan assets and approximately 51% of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the U.S. qualified plan as of December 31, 2020. Unless specified otherwise, the 

47

references in this section are to all of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans. None of our common stock is directly held by these plans.

Our U.S. defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of equity and fixed income securities. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets include a significant concentration of United Kingdom ("U.K.") fixed income securities, as discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We monitor investment allocations and manage plan assets to maintain an acceptable level of risk. At December 31, 2020, the estimated fair market value of U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans increased to $765.0 million from $745.1 million at December 31, 2019. Assets were allocated as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The projected benefit obligation ("Benefit Obligation") for our defined benefit pension plans was $957.4 million and $897.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on participants’ compensation and years of credited service. 

We sponsor defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the U.S. These plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies. We fund the plans as benefits are paid, such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented. Accordingly, we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets. The benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees.

The Benefit Obligation for our defined benefit postretirement medical plans was $18.6 million and $18.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions

We account for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments.

48

Our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We, in consultation with our actuaries, evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits, such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets for funded plans, mortality rates, retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases, and determine such assumptions as of December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. See discussion of our accounting for and assumptions related to pension and postretirement benefits in the “Our Critical Accounting Estimates” section of this MD&A.

In 2020, the service cost component of the pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in operating income was $32.9 million compared with $29.0 million in 2019 and $29.4 million in 2018. The non-service cost portion of net pension expense (e.g., interest cost, actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets) for our defined benefit pension plans included in other income (expense), net was $4.0 million, compared to $1.8 million in 2019 and a benefit of $1.2 million in 2018. 

The following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2020:

The following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the U.S. qualified and aggregate non-U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement plans.

Effect of Discount Rate Changes and Constancy of Other Assumptions:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Effect of Changes in the Expected Return on Assets and Constancy of Other Assumptions:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As discussed below, accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees or over the remaining expected lifetime for plans with only inactive participants.

49

At December 31, 2020, as compared with December 31, 2019, we decreased our discount rate for the U.S. plan from 3.41% to 2.62% based on an analysis of publicly-traded investment grade U.S. corporate bonds, which had lower yields due to current market conditions. The average discount rate for the non-U.S. plans decreased from 1.61% to 1.23% based on analysis of bonds and other publicly-traded instruments, by country, which had lower yields due to market conditions. The average assumed rate of compensation increased to 3.63% for the U.S. plan and decreased to 3.11% from 3.12% for our non-U.S. plans. To determine the 2020 pension expense, the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets remained constant at 6.00% and we decreased our average rate of return on non-U.S. plan assets from 3.37% to 2.37%, primarily based on our target allocations and expected long-term asset returns. As the expected rate of return on plan assets is long-term in nature, short-term market fluctuations do not significantly impact the rate. For all U.S. plans, we adopted the Pri-2012 mortality tables and the MP-2020 improvement scale published in October 2020. We applied the Pri-2012 tables based on the constituency of our plan population for union and non-union participants. We adjusted the improvement scale to utilize the Proxy SSA Long Term Improvement Rates ("LTIR"), consistent with assumptions adopted by the Social Security Administration trustees, based on long-term historical experience. Currently, we believe this approach provides the best estimate of our future obligation. Most plan participants elect to receive plan benefits as a lump sum at the end of service, rather than an annuity. As such, the updated mortality tables had an immaterial effect on our pension obligation. 

We expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately $3.3 million lower in 2021 than the $37.0 million in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in interest costs and expected return on assets with no anticipated special events. We have used discount rates of 2.62%, 1.23% and 2.32% at December 31, 2020, in calculating our estimated 2021 net pension expense for the U.S. pension plans, non-U.S. pension plans and postretirement medical plans, respectively.

The assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were 7.0% for 2020, 7.5% for 2019 and 7% for 2018, with a gradual decrease to 5.0% for 2029 and future years. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care.

Plan Funding

Our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs. We contributed $15.9 million, $37.3 million and $48.1 million to our defined benefit plans in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. After consideration of our intent to remain fully-funded based on standards set by law, we currently anticipate that our contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2021 will be approximately $20 million, excluding direct benefits paid. We expect to contribute approximately $2 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2021, excluding direct benefits paid.

For further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions, including our historical experience, where relevant. The most significant estimates made by management include: timing and amount of revenue recognition; deferred taxes, tax valuation allowances and tax reserves; reserves for contingent loss; pension and postretirement benefits; and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The significant estimates are reviewed at least annually if not quarterly by management. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements, actual results may differ from the estimates, and the difference may be material.

Our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting estimates and policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control to a customer. Transfer of control is evaluated based on the customer’s ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits of a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized either over time or at a point in time, depending on the specific facts and circumstances for each contract, including the terms and conditions of the contract as agreed with the customer and the nature of the products or services to be provided. 

Our primary method for recognizing revenue over time is the percentage of completion (“POC”) method, whereby progress towards completion is measured by applying an input measure based on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. If control of the products and/or services does not transfer over time, then control transfers at a point in time. We determine the point in time that control transfers to a customer based on the evaluation of specific indicators, such as title transfer, risk of loss transfer, customer acceptance and physical possession. For a discussion related to revenue recognition refer to Note 3 included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves 

We recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of the valuation allowances, if necessary. We assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. Implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could, if successful, result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances. 

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from uncertain tax positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

While we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities. To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.

Reserves for Contingent Loss

We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits that seek to recover damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products formerly manufactured and/or distributed by heritage companies of the Company. We have estimated that the liability for pending and future claims not yet asserted, and which are probable and estimable, could be experienced through 2049, which represents the expected end of our asbestos liability exposure with no further ongoing claims expected beyond that date. This estimate is based on the Company's historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed based on anticipated levels of unique plaintiff asbestos-related claims in the U.S. tort system against all defendants, the diminished volatility and consistency of observable claims data, the period of time that has elapsed since we stopped manufacturing products that contained encapsulated asbestos and an expected downward trend in claims due to the average age of our claimants. This estimate is not discounted to present value. In light of the uncertainties and variables inherent in the long-term projection of the total asbestos liability, as part of our ongoing review of asbestos claims, each year we will reassess the projected liability of unasserted asbestos claims to be filed through 2049, and we will continually reassess the time horizon over which a reasonable estimate of unasserted claims can be projected. 

We assess the sufficiency of the estimated liability for pending and future claims on an ongoing basis by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed, settled and dismissed, and amounts paid in settlements. In addition to claims and settlement experience, we consider additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation, the legal 

51

environment and the Company's defense strategy. In connection with our ongoing review of asbestos-related claims, we have also reviewed the amount of potential insurance coverage for such claims, taking into account the remaining limits of such coverage, the number and amount of claims on our insurance from co-insured parties, ongoing litigation against the Company’s insurers, potential remaining recoveries from insolvent insurers, the impact of previous insurance settlements and coverage available from solvent insurers not party to the coverage litigation. Continuously, we review ongoing insurance coverage available for a significant amount of the potential future asbestos-related claims and in the future could secure additional insurance coverage as deemed necessary. 

The study from the Company's actuary, based on data as of September 30, 2020, provided for a range of possible future liability from approximately $80.1 million to $131.7 million. The Company does not believe any amount within the range of potential outcomes represents a better estimate than another given the many factors and assumptions inherent in the projections and therefore the Company has recorded the liability at the actuarial central estimate of approximately $99.5 million as of December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company has recorded estimated insurance receivables of approximately $69.5 million as of December 31, 2020. The amounts recorded for the asbestos-related liability and the related insurance receivables are based on facts known at the time and a number of assumptions. However, projecting future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the length of time it takes to defend, resolve, or otherwise dispose of such claims, coverage issues among insurers and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the United States, could cause the actual liability and insurance recoveries for us to be higher or lower than those projected or recorded. Additionally, we have claims pending against certain insurers that, if resolved more favorably than reflected in the recorded receivables, would result in discrete gains in the applicable year. Changes recorded in the estimated liability and estimated insurance recovery based on projections of asbestos litigation and corresponding insurance coverage, result in the recognition of additional expense or income. For a discussion pertaining to the activity related to asbestos claims refer to Note 16 included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Liabilities are recorded for various non-asbestos contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is reasonably estimable. Assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in-house experts, including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations. The recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter, changes in political environments, legal venue and other factors. Recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties, technological innovation and regulatory environment changes. 

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

We provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, including former employees, and their beneficiaries. The assets, liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, expected rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates, turnover, rates of compensation increases and other factors.

The assumptions utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These assumptions are assessed annually in consultation with independent actuaries and investment advisors as of December 31 and adjustments are made as needed. We evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained, including appropriate rates of return, interest rates and medical inflation (health care cost trend) rates. We ensure that our significant assumptions are within the reasonable range relative to market data. The methodology to set our significant assumptions includes:

•Discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments. For the U.S. the discount rate is obtained from an analysis of publicly-traded investment-grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate. For plans in the U.K. and the Eurozone we use the discount rate obtained from an analysis of AA-graded corporate bonds used to generate a yield curve. For other countries or regions without a corporate AA bond market, government bond rates are used. Our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term high-quality debt securities, as well as the duration of our plans’ liabilities.

52

•The expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies, expected long-term performance of asset classes, risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. These rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. Changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates.

•The expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels, seniority, age and other factors.

Depending on the assumptions used, the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. 

We evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations, cash flow requirements and other factors. We discuss our funding assumptions with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors.

Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets 

The initial recording of goodwill and intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. We test the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31 each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. 

The test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units. The identification of our reporting units began at the operating segment level and considered whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purpose of testing goodwill for impairment based on certain conditions. These conditions included, among other factors, (i) the extent to which a component represents a business and (ii) the aggregation of economically similar components within the operating segments and resulted in three reporting units. Other factors that were considered in determining whether the aggregation of components was appropriate included the similarity of the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the methods of distribution and the types of industries served. 

Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350 allows an optional qualitative assessment, prior to a quantitative assessment test, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. We generally do not attempt a qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is impaired and an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market participants. 

We did not record an impairment of goodwill in 2020, 2019 or 2018; however, the estimated fair value of our Pump reporting unit has reduced moderately during the year due to decreased broad-based capital spending resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and to a lesser extent the heightened pricing pressure experienced in the oil and gas markets, both of which are anticipated to continue in the near to mid-term. The Pump reporting unit is a component of EPD reporting segment and is primarily focused on highly engineered custom and pre-configured pump products and systems. As of December 31, 2020, our Pump reporting unit had approximately $482.7 million of goodwill and an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 46% as compared to approximately $468.8 million of goodwill and an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 131% as of December 31, 2019. The key factors considered in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units included the annual operating plan and forecasted operating results, successful execution of our current continuous improvement and identified strategic initiatives, a constant cost of capital, continued stabilization and mid to long-term improvement of the macro-economic conditions of the oil and gas market, and a relatively stable global gross domestic product. Although we have concluded that there is no impairment on the goodwill associated with our Pump reporting unit as of December 31, 2020, we will continue to closely monitor their performance and related market conditions for future indicators of potential impairment and reassess accordingly.

53

We also considered our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill. Our market capitalization decreased as compared with 2019, however this did not indicate a potential impairment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2020. 

Impairment losses for indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Fair values are calculated for trademarks using a "relief from royalty" method, which estimates the fair value of a trademark by determining the present value of estimated royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark. This method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that have a significant impact on the fair value and are substantially consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting unit discussed above. We did not record a material impairment of our trademarks in 2020, 2019 or 2018.

The recoverable value of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, is reviewed when indicators of potential impairments are present. The recoverable value is based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing assumptions similar to those for goodwill. Additional considerations related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization.

Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
