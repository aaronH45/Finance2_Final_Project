PART I

Item 1. Business 

Fluor Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in September, 2000. However, through our predecessors, we have been in business for over a century.

Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "FLR".

Fluor Corporation is a holding company that owns a number of subsidiaries, as well as interests in joint ventures. Acting through these entities, we are one of the largest professional services firms providing engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, operations, maintenance and asset integrity, as well as project management services, on a global basis. We provide these services to our clients in a diverse set of industries worldwide including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, mining and metals, infrastructure, life sciences, advanced manufacturing and advanced technologies. We are also a service provider to the U.S. federal government and governments abroad; and, we perform operations, maintenance and asset integrity activities globally for major industrial clients.

At December 31, 2020, we operated our business through six principal segments. The six segments were: Energy & Chemicals; Mining & Industrial; Infrastructure & Power; Government; Diversified Services; and Other. Fluor Constructors International, Inc., which is organized and operates separately from the rest of our business, provides unionized management and construction services in the United States and Canada, both independently and as a subcontractor on projects in each of our segments.

In January 2021, we introduced our new strategy, "Building a Better Future" during a Strategy Day event with investors. At our Strategy Day, we outlined four strategic priorities for driving value creation for our shareholders:

•Drive growth across our portfolio, by growing markets outside of the traditional oil and gas sector, including energy transition, advanced technology and life sciences, high-demand metals, infrastructure and mission solutions;

•Pursue contracts with fair and balanced commercial terms that reward value, with a bias towards reimbursable contracts;

•Reinforce financial discipline, maintaining a solid balance sheet by generating predictable cash flow and earnings; and

•Foster a high-performance culture with purpose, by advancing our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and promoting social progress and sustainability.

Competitive Strengths

As a world-class provider of our services, we believe that we bring capital efficient business solutions that combine excellence in execution, safety, cost containment and experience to our clients. In that regard, we believe that our business strengths and global positioning provide us with significant competitive advantages:

Safety. One of our core values is our constant focus on safety. Maintaining a safe and secure workplace is a key business driver for us and our clients. In our experience, whether in an office or at a jobsite, a safe environment decreases risks, assures a proper environment for all workers, enhances morale, improves productivity, reduces project cost and generally improves client relations. We believe that our commitment to safety is one of our most distinguishing features.

Global Execution Platform. As one of the larger publicly-traded EPC companies, we have a global footprint with employees situated throughout the world. Our global presence allows us to build local relationships to capitalize on opportunities near these locations. We believe it also allows us to mobilize quickly to project sites around the world and to draw on our local knowledge and talent pools. We continue to form strategic alliances with local partners, leverage our supply chain expertise and emphasize local training programs. We also provide services from our distributed execution centers on a cost-efficient basis.

Excellence in Execution. We believe that our ability to execute, maintain and manage complex projects, often in geographically challenging locations, gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We strive to complete our projects meeting or exceeding all client specifications. We have continued to shift toward data-driven execution, which we expect will enhance our ability to meet our clients' needs.

Market Diversity. We serve multiple markets across a broad spectrum of industries around the globe. We feel that our market diversity helps to mitigate the impact of the cyclicality in the markets we serve. Just as important, our concentrated 

3
attention on market diversification should allow us to achieve more consistent growth and deliver solid financial returns. We believe that maintaining a good mixture within our entire business portfolio permits us to both focus on our more stable business markets and to capitalize on cyclical markets when the timing is appropriate.

Client Relationships. We actively pursue relationships with new clients while also building on our long-term relationships with existing clients. We believe that long-term relationships with existing clients serve us well by allowing us to better understand and be more responsive to their requirements. Regardless of whether our clients are new or have been with us for many decades, our ability to successfully foster relationships is a key strength.

Risk Management. In combination with our new pursuit criteria and guidelines we believe we have enhanced our ability to assess, mitigate and manage project risk, especially in difficult locations or circumstances. We have an experienced management team, and utilize a systematic and disciplined approach towards identifying, assessing and managing risks. We believe that our risk management approach helps us control costs and meet clients' schedules.

General Operations

Our services fall into six broad categories (outlined below). Our services can range from basic consulting activities, often at the early stages of a project, to complete design-build, operations and maintenance contracts.

•In engineering and design, we develop solutions to address our clients’ most complex problems. Our engineering services range from traditional engineering disciplines such as piping, mechanical, electrical, control systems, civil, structural and architectural to advanced engineering specialties including process engineering, chemical engineering, simulation, integrated automation processes and interactive 3-D modeling. Through our design solutions, we can provide clients with varied offerings which can include front-end engineering, conceptual design, estimating, feasibility studies, permitting, process simulation, technology and licensing evaluation, scope definition and siting.

•Our procurement offerings include procurement and supply chain solutions aimed at improving product quality and performance while also reducing project cost and schedule. Our clients draw upon our global sourcing and supply expertise, global purchasing power, technical knowledge, processes, systems and experienced global resources. Our procurement activities include strategic sourcing, material management, contracts management, buying, expediting, supplier quality inspection and logistics.

•In construction, we mobilize, execute, commission and demobilize projects on a self-perform or subcontracted basis. Generally, we are responsible for the completion of a project, often in difficult locations and under challenging circumstances. We are frequently designated as a program manager, and serve as such without regard to whether the client has facilities in multiple locations, complex phases in a single project location, or a large-scale investment in a facility.

•We also provide a variety of fabrication and modularization services, including integrated engineering and modular fabrication and assembly, as well as modular construction and asset support services to clients around the globe from our joint venture yards. By operating our own fabrication yards in key regions of the world, our off-site fabrication solutions can help our clients achieve cost and schedule savings by reducing on-site craft needs and shifting work to inherently safer and more controlled work environments.

•We offer operations, maintenance and asset integrity services intended to improve the performance and extend the life of our clients’ facilities. This may include the global delivery of total maintenance services, facility management, plant readiness, commissioning, start-up and maintenance technology, small capital projects, and turnaround and outage services. Among other things, we can provide key management, staffing and management skills to clients on-site at their facilities. These activities also include routine and outage/turnaround maintenance services, general maintenance and asset management, emissions reduction technologies and services, and restorative, repair, predictive and prevention services.

•Project management involves managing all aspects of the effort to deliver projects on schedule and within budget, and is critical on every project. We are often hired as the overall program manager on large complex projects where various contractors and subcontractors are involved and multiple activities need to be integrated to ensure the success of the overall project. Our services include logistics, development of project execution plans, detailed schedules, cost forecasts, progress tracking and reporting, and the integration of EPC efforts. Project management is accountable to the client to deliver the safety, functionality and financial performance requirements of the project.

4
Business Segments (as of December 31, 2020)

Energy & Chemicals

Our Energy & Chemicals segment focuses on opportunities in the upstream, midstream, downstream, chemical, petrochemical, offshore and onshore oil and gas production, LNG and pipeline markets. We have long served a broad spectrum of industries offering a full range of design, engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and project management services. While we perform projects that range greatly in size and scope, we believe that one of our distinguishing features is that we are one of the few companies that have the global strength and experience to perform extremely large projects in difficult locations. As the locations of large scale energy and chemicals projects have become more challenging geographically, geopolitically or otherwise, we believe that clients will continue to look to us based upon our size, strength, global reach, experience and track record to manage their complex projects.

With each specific project, our role can vary. We may be involved in providing front-end engineering, program management and final design services, construction management services, self-perform construction, or oversight of other contractors, and we may also assume responsibility for the procurement of materials, equipment and subcontractors. We have the capacity to design, fabricate and construct new facilities, upgrade, modernize and expand existing facilities, and rebuild facilities following fires and explosions. We also provide consulting services ranging from feasibility studies to process assessments to project finance structuring and studies.

In the upstream sector, our clients need to develop additional and new sources of supply. Our typical projects in the upstream sector revolve around the production, processing and transporting of oil and gas resources, including the development of infrastructure associated with major new fields and pipelines. We are also involved in offshore production facilities and in conventional and unconventional gas projects in various geographic locations.

In the downstream sector, our clients have been modernizing and modifying existing refineries to increase capacity, improve margins and improve environmental performance. We continue to play a key role in each of these markets. We are also focused on sustainable markets, such as clean fuels, green energy and carbon sequestration, where an increasing number of clients and countries are implementing stronger environmental standards and goals.

We have been very active for several decades in the chemicals and petrochemicals market, with major projects involving the expansion of ethylene-based derivatives as well as specialty chemicals. The most active markets have been in the United States, Middle East and Asia, where there is significant demand for chemical products.

Mining & Industrial

The Mining & Industrial segment provides design, engineering, procurement, construction and project management services to the mining and metals, life sciences, advanced manufacturing and advanced technologies sectors.

In mining and metals, we provide a full range of services to our clients who produce a variety of commodities, including bauxite, copper, gold, iron ore, diamond, nickel, alumina, aluminum and phosphates. Our services include conceptual and feasibility studies through detailed engineering, design, procurement, construction, commissioning and startup support. Many of these opportunities are being developed in remote and logistically challenging environments, such as the Andes Mountains, Western Australia and Africa. We believe we are one of the few companies with the size, regional presence and experience to execute large scale mining and metals projects in these difficult and remote locations. 

For the advanced manufacturing and technologies market, we provide design, engineering, procurement, construction and construction management services to a wide variety of industries on a global basis. We specialize in designing projects that incorporate lean manufacturing concepts while also satisfying client sustainability goals. Our experience spans a wide variety of market segments ranging from traditional manufacturing to advanced technology projects, such as data centers.

In life sciences, we provide design, engineering, procurement, construction and construction management services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. We also specialize in providing validation and commissioning services where we not only bring new facilities into production, but we also keep existing facilities operating. We believe the ability to complete projects on a large scale basis, especially in a business where time to market is critical, enables us to better serve our clients and is a key competitive advantage.

Infrastructure & Power

The Infrastructure & Power segment provides design, engineering, procurement, construction and project management services to the infrastructure sector.

5
We are an industry leader in developing infrastructure projects such as roads, highways, bridges and rail for governments, with particular interest in large, complex projects. We provide a broad range of services including consulting, design, planning, financial structuring, engineering and construction. We also provide long-term operation and maintenance services for transit and highway projects. Our projects may involve the use of public/private partnerships, which allow us to develop and finance deals in concert with public entities for projects such as toll roads and rail lines that would not have otherwise been undertaken with public funding alone. The replacement and expansion of aging infrastructure in North America continues to drive project opportunities.

Historically, we have also offered a full range of services including engineering, procurement, construction, program management, startup and commissioning and technical services to utilities, independent power producers, original equipment manufacturers and other third parties.

Government

The Government segment provides engineering and construction services, logistics and life-support, as well as contingency operations support, to the defense sector. We support military logistical and infrastructure needs around the world, including life-support, engineering, procurement, construction and logistical augmentation services to the U.S. military and coalition forces in various international locations. This segment also provides full life-cycle infrastructure support to the U.S. intelligence community globally.

The Government segment also provides support to the U.S. Department of Energy and National Nuclear Security Administration that includes management, mission operations, environmental remediation, decommissioning, engineering and construction services that address the many environmental and regulatory challenges associated with legacy and operational nuclear sites.

We also provide support to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This includes supporting the U.S. government’s rapid response capabilities to address security issues and disaster relief, the latter primarily through our long-standing relationship with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and in support of the Army Corps of Engineers.

Diversified Services

The Diversified Services segment provides a wide array of asset maintenance, asset integrity and staffing services. These services are provided around the world during both the project delivery phase as well as to new or existing client production assets.

Through our subsidiary, Stork, we provide asset maintenance and asset integrity services to the oil and gas, chemicals, life sciences, power, mining and metals, consumer products and manufacturing industries. We focus on asset management solutions, as well as providing asset services in areas such as electrical, instrumentation, mechanical and piping. We also provide asset integrity services, including new asset readiness solutions, inspection of existing assets, and asset turnaround and modification solutions. This business, driven by our clients' annual operating expenditures, often benefits from large projects that originate in another of our segments, which can lead to long-term operations or maintenance opportunities. Our long-term maintenance contracts can also lead to larger capital projects for our other business segments when those needs arise. Our goal is to help clients improve the performance of their assets, including late-life management solutions. In the first quarter of 2021, we announced a plan to sell Stork, which we expect will be reported as a discontinued operation beginning with the first quarter of 2021.

The segment's staffing services are provided through TRS Staffing Solutions®. TRS is a global enterprise of staffing specialists that provides the company and third party clients with technical, professional and craft resources either on a contract or permanent placement basis.

Other

Our Other segment includes the financial information for NuScale, as well as two lump-sum projects for which the U.S. government is either the client or ultimate client.

NuScale, a small modular nuclear reactor (“SMR”) technology company, is a leader in the development of light water, passively safe SMRs, which we believe will provide us with significant future project opportunities. NuScale received final design certification by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in August 2020.

6
Discontinued Operations

In the third quarter of 2019, we implemented a number of strategic initiatives and organizational changes to strengthen our financial position and improve operational performance. Among those initiatives, we committed to a plan to sell substantially all of our AMECO business, which is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.

AMECO provides integrated construction equipment, tool, scaffolding and fleet service solutions to the company and third party clients in a focused number of locations around the world for construction projects and client production assets.

Business Segments (as of January 1, 2021)

At December 31, 2020, we operated our business through six principal business segments described above. In the first quarter of 2021, we announced an updated organizational and reporting structure. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we will operate through three business segments: Energy Solutions, Urban Solutions and Mission Solutions. Energy Solutions will focus on energy transition, chemicals and traditional oil and gas opportunities. Urban Solutions will focus on mining, metals, advanced technologies, manufacturing, life sciences, infrastructure and our professional staffing services. Mission Solutions will focus on delivering solutions to federal agencies across the U.S. government and to select international opportunities.

Other Matters

Backlog

Backlog represents the total amount of revenue we expect to record in the future based upon contracts that have been awarded to us. Backlog is stated in terms of gross revenues and may include significant estimated amounts of third-party, subcontracted and pass-through costs.

Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the value of work to be performed on contracts already awarded and those in progress.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1)With respect to our ongoing operations and maintenance and asset integrity contracts in the Diversified Services segment, backlog includes the amount of revenue we expect to recognize for the remainder of the current year renewal period plus up to three additional years if we consider renewal to be probable. The equipment and temporary staffing businesses in the Diversified Services segment do not report backlog or new awards.

(2)Includes backlog of $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion for projects in a loss position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(3)For projects related to proportionately consolidated joint ventures, we include only our percentage ownership of each joint venture's backlog.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________________________________________________

7
Although backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations, deferrals or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and project deferrals, as appropriate. The terms and conditions of some contracts include elements of both lump-sum and reimbursable contracts. Also, certain contracts may be converted from reimbursable to lump-sum. Due to additional factors outside of our control, such as changes in project schedules, we cannot accurately predict the exact timing that our December 31, 2020 backlog will be earned as revenue. Accordingly, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future earnings or revenues and no assurances can be provided that we will ultimately realize revenue on our backlog.

The following table sets forth our changes in consolidated backlog:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1)Adjustments and cancellations during 2019 included the cancellation of two infrastructure projects as well as the suspension of certain contracts associated with our joint venture in Mexico.

In 2021, we expect to perform approximately 50% of our total backlog reported as of December 31, 2020, which is in line with the last three years. 

Types of Contracts

While the basic terms and conditions of the contracts that we perform may vary considerably, we typically perform our work under two types of contracts: (a) reimbursable contracts and (b) lump-sum or guaranteed maximum contracts. In some markets, we are seeing hybrid contracts containing both lump-sum and reimbursable elements. As of December 31, 2020, the following table summarizes contract type within our ending backlog:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of our client. In such situations, our contracts typically provide for the payment of fees earned through the date of termination and the reimbursement of costs incurred including demobilization costs.

Under reimbursable contracts, the client reimburses us based upon negotiated rates and pays us a pre-determined fee, or a fee based upon a percentage of the cost incurred in completing the project. Our profit may be in the form of a fee, a simple markup applied to labor cost incurred in performing the contract, or a combination of the two. The fee element may also vary. The fee may be an incentive fee based upon achieving certain performance factors, milestones or targets; it may be a fixed amount in the contract; or it may be based upon a percentage of the cost incurred. In some cases, reimbursable contracts may be converted into lump-sum contracts.

Our Government segment, primarily acting as a prime contractor or a major subcontractor for a number of government programs, generally performs its services under reimbursable contracts subject to applicable statutes and regulations. In many cases, these contracts include incentive fee arrangements. The programs may span many years and may be implemented by awards under multiple contracts. Some of our government contracts are known as indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) agreements. Under these arrangements, we work closely with the government to define the scope and amount of work required based upon an estimate of the maximum amount that the government desires to spend. While the scope is often not initially fully defined or does not require any specific amount of work, once the project scope is determined, additional work may be awarded to us without the need for further competitive bidding.

Under lump-sum contracts, we typically bid based upon specifications provided by the client. This type of contracting presents risks because it requires us to predetermine the work to be performed, the project execution schedule and all costs 

8
associated with the work. Another type of lump-sum contract is a negotiated fixed-price contract, under which we are selected as contractor first, and then we negotiate price with the client. Negotiated fixed-price contracts frequently occur in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some of the work before negotiating the total price for the project. Another type of lump-sum contract is a unit price contract under which we are paid a set amount for every “unit” of work performed. If we perform well under these types of contracts, we can benefit from cost savings. However, if the project does not proceed as originally planned, we may not be able to recover cost overruns except in certain situations.

Guaranteed maximum price contracts are reimbursable contracts except that the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price. We can be responsible for some or all of the total cost of the project if the cost exceeds the guaranteed maximum price. Where the total cost is less than the negotiated guaranteed maximum price, we may receive the benefit of the cost savings based upon a negotiated agreement with the client.

Some of our contracts, regardless of type, may operate under joint ventures or other teaming arrangements. Typically, we enter into these arrangements with reputable companies with whom we have worked previously. These arrangements are generally made to strengthen our market position or technical skills, or where the size, scale or location of the project directs the use of such arrangements.

Competition

We are one of the world’s larger providers of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, operations, maintenance and asset integrity, and project management services. The markets served by our business are highly competitive and, for the most part, require substantial resources and highly skilled and experienced technical personnel. A large number of companies compete against us, including U.S.-based companies such as AECOM, Bechtel Group, Inc., EMCOR Group, Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., KBR, Inc., Kiewit Corporation, Granite Construction, Inc. and Quanta Services, Inc., and international-based companies such as ACS Actividades de Construccion y Servicios, Balfour Beatty plc, Chiyoda Corporation, Hyundai Engineering & Construction Company, Ltd., JGC Corporation, McDermott International, Inc., Petrofac Limited, SNC-Lavalin Group, Inc., Samsung Engineering, Stantec Inc., TechnipFMC plc, Wood Group plc, and WorleyParsons Limited.

Competition for our Energy & Chemicals, Mining & Industrial and Infrastructure & Power segments is based on an ability to provide the design, engineering, planning, management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe, timely and cost-efficient manner. We believe our engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction business derives its competitive strength from our diversity, excellence in execution, reputation for quality, technology, cost-effectiveness, worldwide procurement capability, project management expertise, geographic coverage, ability to meet client requirements by performing construction on either a union or an open shop basis, ability to execute complex projects of varying sizes, strong safety record and lengthy experience with a wide range of services and technologies.

The various markets served by the Diversified Services segment, while having some similarities to other segments, tend also to have discrete issues impacting individual business lines. Each of the markets we serve has a large number of competing companies. In the operations and maintenance markets, barriers to entry are both financially and logistically low, resulting in a fragmented industry with no single company being dominant. Competition in those markets is generally driven by reputation, price and the capacity to perform. Temporary staffing is a highly fragmented market with over 1,000 companies competing globally. The key competitive factors in this business line are price, service, quality, client relationships, breadth of service and the ability to identify and retain qualified personnel and geographic coverage.

In the Government segment, key competitive factors are primarily centered on performance, reputation and the ability to provide the design, engineering, planning, management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe, timely, cost-efficient and compliant manner. 

The AMECO business, which operates in numerous markets, is highly fragmented and very competitive, with a large number of competitors mostly operating in specific geographic areas. The competition in the equipment business for larger capital project services is more narrow and limited to only those capable of providing comprehensive equipment, tool and management services. 

Raw Materials

The principal products we use in our business include structural steel, metal plate, concrete, cable and various electrical and mechanical components. These products and components are subject to raw material (aluminum, copper, nickel, iron ore, etc.) availability and pricing fluctuations, which we monitor on a regular basis. We have access to numerous global supply sources, and we do not foresee any unavailability of these items that would have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term. However, the availability of these products, components and raw materials may vary significantly from year to year due to various factors including client demand, producer capacity, market conditions and specific material shortages.

9
Compliance with Government Regulations, Including Environmental, Safety and Health Matters

We provide services at sites throughout the world. Work at some of these sites involves activities related to nuclear facilities, hazardous waste, hydrocarbon production, distribution and transport, the military and infrastructure. Some of our work can be performed adjacent to environmentally sensitive locations such as wetlands, lakes and rivers. We also contract with governments to remediate hazardous materials, including chemical agents and weapons, as well as to decontaminate and decommission nuclear sites. These activities can require us to manage, handle, remove, treat, transport and dispose of toxic, radioactive or hazardous substances, and are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

We believe that we are generally compliant with all environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We further believe that any accruals with respect to future environmental costs are adequate and that any future costs will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Some factors, however, could result in additional expenditures or the provision of additional accruals in expectation of such expenditures. These include the imposition of more stringent requirements under environmental laws or regulations, new developments or changes regarding site cleanup costs or the allocation of such costs among potentially responsible parties, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at sites other than those currently identified.

Human Capital Management

We promote a high performance culture with purpose and foster a diverse and inclusive workplace as a business imperative because we consider people to be our single greatest asset. A high performance culture, where everyone is treated fairly and respectfully and has equal access to opportunities based on capabilities and performance, regardless of background, raises both the individual and collective performance of our company. Our culture drives employee engagement, productivity and a sustainable competitive advantage.

The following summarizes our human capital information as of December 31, 2020:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The number of craft and hourly employees can vary in relation to the number, size and phase of execution of our projects. We have employees in the following regions:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Health and Safety

Safety is one of our core values. We are committed to taking care of our employees and preventing injuries in our offices and project locations. Our robust programs and procedures help us mitigate the hazards inherent in the work we do. We are committed to fostering a caring, preventative culture founded on proactive action by engaged employees. We call this Safer TogetherSM. Our 2020 safety performance resulted in a total case incident rate of 0.38 (calculated in accordance with OSHA record keeping requirements), outperforming our goal of less than 0.40 and well below the comparable industry benchmarks. From 2019 to 2020, we also experienced reductions in the number of work-related life-altering injuries, lost time injuries and injuries requiring medical treatment or work restriction.

In response to COVID-19, we implemented a number of measures to protect the well-being of our employees and mitigate COVID-19 transmission within our offices and on our projects. We established a global COVID-19 task force in January 2020 and implemented actions to empower remote working, restrict non-essential business travel, enhance sanitation at our offices and project sites, and other return-to-work measures. We have an employee assistance program to support employee well-being with a focus on mental health. We also created a Workplace Flexibility global task force to define the workplace of the future.

10
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We are committed to advancing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DE&I"). We believe that every voice matters, and we value DE&I at every level. We embrace different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds. We listen actively, respect one another and foster an environment with a deep sense of pride and belonging. We are focused on four key impact pillars to advance DE&I:

•Champion an inclusive culture;

•Recruit, develop and retain talent; 

•Enhance employee experience; and

•Improve social progress and impact.

We engage and partner with select organizations that represent and support gender, racial and ethnic diversity in the engineering profession, and we work with a variety of university student associations to reach targeted populations. We extend our job postings to the appropriate state workforce agencies as well as a syndicated network of partner sites, in order to reach a diverse pool of candidates.

Development Opportunities

One of our top priorities is to provide ongoing training and development for our employees through multiple venues, including Fluor University, our online learning platform. Employees can select from among a wide variety of self-paced, online training courses and have options to sign up for location-specific, instructor-led and virtual courses. Topics range from discipline-specific and targeted technical learning to general knowledge topics, such as leadership, business acumen, communication and inclusive management. In 2020, our employees earned more than 98,000 credit hours through Fluor University.

We have also developed several programs to help employees advance their careers, including Fluor Fellows for our technical experts and Mentoring Circles. In addition, we currently have three employee resource groups: Growing Representation & Opportunity for Women ("GROW"), Graduates Advancing to Professionalism ("GAP") and Emerging Leaders Group ("ELG").

Community Responsibility

Part of building a high-performance culture with purpose is offering employees robust and enriching opportunities to help build a better future through volunteerism and philanthropy. For more than 40 years, our employee volunteer program, Fluor Cares, has given employees a conduit for giving back to the communities where we live and work. In 2020, employees volunteered more than 24,000 hours to charitable organizations and causes. Additionally, employees pledged $3.6 million, which included a 25 percent company match, through our North America employee giving campaign. 

We remained true to our legacy of giving back even as COVID-19 continued to impact lives and communities in far-reaching and profound ways. Our employees continued to exhibit compassion and generosity for those affected by the virus. Local community relations teams directed financial resources to the most significant COVID-19 relief efforts in their local communities with contributions exceeding $0.7 million to local COVID-19 relief funds organized by our community partners in support of meal service charities, critical human needs and schools.
