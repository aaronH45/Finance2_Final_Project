BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The Company’s six reporting segments are described below. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Digital Real Estate Services 

The Company’s Digital Real Estate Services segment consists of its 61.4% interest in REA Group, a publicly-traded company listed on ASX (ASX: REA), and its 80% interest in Move. The remaining 20% interest in Move is held by REA Group. 

REA Group 

REA Group is a market-leading digital media business specializing in property, with operations focused on property and property-related advertising and services, as well as financial services. 

Property and Property-Related Advertising and Services 

REA Group advertises property and property-related services on its websites and mobile apps across Australia and Asia. REA Group’s Australian operations include leading residential, commercial and share property websites realestate.com.au, realcommercial.com.au and Flatmates.com.au. Additionally, REA Group operates media display and data services businesses, serving the display media market and markets adjacent to property, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2021, average monthly visits to realestate.com.au were more than 121.9 million. Launches of the realestate.com.au app increased 49% to 55.0 million average monthly launches in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year, with consumers spending almost four times longer on the app than any other property app in Australia according to Nielsen Digital Content Ratings. Realcommercial.com.au remains Australia’s leading commercial property site across website and app. In fiscal 2021, the realcommercial.com.au app was launched 12.7 times more than the nearest competitor, and consumers spent 10.4 times longer on the realcommercial.com.au app based on Nielsen Digital Content Ratings data. Flatmates.com.au is the largest site for share accommodation in Australia, with average monthly visits of almost 2.9 million and more than 300,000 new members during fiscal 2021.

Realestate.com.au and realcommerical.com.au derive the majority of their revenue from their core property advertising listing products and monthly advertising subscriptions from real estate agents and property developers. Realestate.com.au and 

2
realcommercial.com.au offer a product hierarchy which enables real estate agents and property developers to upgrade listing advertisements to increase their prominence on the site, as well as a variety of targeted products, including media display advertising products. Flatmates.com.au derives the majority of its revenue from advertising listing products and membership fees. The media business offers unique advertising opportunities on REA Group’s websites to property developers and other relevant markets, including utilities and telecommunications, insurance, finance, automotive and retail. REA Group also provides residential property data services to the financial sector through its Proptrack (formerly Hometrack) data services business, primarily on a monthly subscription basis. 

REA Group’s international operations consist of digital property assets in Asia, including wholly-owned property portals in Hong Kong and China, a 65.5% interest in Elara Technologies Pte. Ltd. (“Elara”), a leading digital real estate services provider in India that owns and operates PropTiger.com and Housing.com (News Corp holds a 34.3% interest in Elara), and an 18% interest in PropertyGuru Pte. Ltd. (“PropertyGuru”), a leading digital property technology company operating marketplaces in Southeast Asia. REA Group acquired its interest in PropertyGuru in August 2021 in exchange for all shares of REA Group’s entities in Malaysia and Thailand. In connection with the PropertyGuru transaction, REA Group entered into an agreement to sell its 27% interest in its existing joint venture with 99.co. REA Group’s other assets include a 20% interest in Move, as referenced above. REA Group’s international businesses derive the majority of their revenue from their property advertising listing products and monthly advertising subscriptions from real estate agents and property developers.

Financial Services 

REA Group’s financial services business encompasses an end-to-end digital property search and financing experience and mortgage broking services under its Smartline – personal mortgage advisers brand. REA Group has accelerated its financial services strategy through the recent acquisitions of Mortgage Choice Limited, a leading Australian mortgage broking business, 

and a 34% interest in Simpology Pty Limited, a leading provider of mortgage application and electronic filing solutions. The financial services business generates revenue primarily through fees and commissions from lenders, mortgage brokers and other customers.

Move 

Move is a leading provider of digital real estate services in the U.S. Move primarily operates realtor.com®, a premier real estate information, advertising and services platform, under a perpetual agreement and trademark license with the National Association of Realtors® (“NAR”). Through realtor.com®, consumers have access to over 142 million properties across the U.S., including an extensive collection of homes, properties and apartments listed and displayed for sale or for rent and a large database of “off-market” properties. Realtor.com® and its related mobile apps display approximately 99% of all Multiple Listing Services (“MLS”)-listed, for-sale and rental properties in the U.S., which are primarily sourced directly from relationships with MLSs across the country. Realtor.com® also sources new construction and rental listing content from a variety of sources, including directly from homebuilders and landlords, as well as from listing aggregators. Approximately 95% of its for-sale listings are updated at least every 10 minutes, on average, with the remaining listings updated daily. Realtor.com®’s content attracts a large and highly engaged consumer audience. Based on internal data, realtor.com® and its mobile sites had over 100 million average monthly unique users during the quarter ended June 30, 2021. See “Part I. Business—Explanatory Note Regarding Certain Metrics.”

Realtor.com® generates the majority of its revenues through the sale of listing advertisement and lead generation products, including ConnectionsSM Plus and AdvantageSM Pro, as well as its real estate referral-based services. Listing advertisement and lead generation products allow real estate agents, brokers and franchises to enhance, prioritize and connect with consumers on for-sale property listings within the realtor.com® website and mobile apps. Listing advertisement and lead generation products are typically sold on a subscription basis. The real estate referral-based business model leverages Move’s proprietary technology and platform to connect real estate professionals and other service providers, such as lenders and insurance companies, to pre-vetted consumers who have submitted inquiries via the realtor.com® website and mobile apps, as well as other online sources. The real estate referral-based services that connect real estate agents and brokers with these consumers typically generate fees upon completion of the associated real estate transaction, while the referral-based services that give other service providers, including lenders and insurance companies, access to the same highly qualified home shoppers are generally provided on a subscription basis. Realtor.com® also derives revenue from sales of non-listing advertisement, or Media, products to real estate, finance, insurance, home improvement and other professionals that enable those professionals to connect with realtor.com®’s highly engaged and valuable consumer audience. Media products include sponsorships, display advertisements, text links, directories and other advertising and lead generation services. Non-listing advertisement pricing models include cost per thousand, cost per click, cost per unique user and subscription-based sponsorships of specific content areas or targeted geographies. 

3
In addition to realtor.com®, Move also offers online tools and services to do-it-yourself landlords and tenants, as well as professional software and services products. These include Avail, a platform that improves the renting experience for do-it-yourself landlords and tenants with online tools, educational content and world-class support. Avail employs a variety of pricing models, including subscription fees, as well as fixed- or variable-pricing models. 

The Company’s digital real estate services businesses operate in highly competitive markets that are evolving rapidly in response to new technologies, business models, product and service offerings and changing consumer and customer preferences. The success of these businesses depends on their ability to provide products and services that are useful for consumers and real estate, mortgage and other related services professionals and attractive to their advertisers, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information they provide and brand awareness and reputation. These businesses compete primarily with companies that provide real-estate focused technology, products and services in their respective geographic markets, including other real estate and property websites in Australia, the United States and Asia. 

Subscription Video Services 

The Company’s Subscription Video Services segment provides sports, entertainment and news services to pay-TV and streaming subscribers and other commercial licensees, primarily via cable, satellite and internet distribution. This segment consists of (i) the Company’s 65% interest in NXE Australia Pty Limited, which, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the “Foxtel Group” (the remaining 35% interest in the Foxtel Group is held by Telstra Corporation Limited), and (ii) Australian News Channel (“ANC”). 

The Foxtel Group 

The Foxtel Group is the largest Australian-based subscription television provider, with a suite of offerings targeting a wide range of consumers. These include (i) its Foxtel premium pay-TV aggregation and Foxtel Now streaming services, which deliver nearly 200 channels1, including a number of owned and operated channels, covering sports, general entertainment, movies, documentaries, music, children’s programming and news, and (ii) its sports and entertainment streaming services, Kayo Sports and BINGE. Through Foxtel, Foxtel Now and Kayo, the Foxtel Group broadcasts and streams approximately 15,000 hours of live sports programming each year, encompassing both live national and international licensed sports events such as National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Australia and various motorsports programming. Live sports programming also includes other featured original and licensed premium sports content tailored to the Australian market such as events from ESPN and beIN Sports. Entertainment content provided by the Foxtel Group through the Foxtel, Foxtel Now and BINGE services includes television programming from HBO, FOX, NBCUniversal, Warner Bros., BBC and Discovery, as well as Foxtel-produced original dramas and lifestyle shows. 

The Foxtel Group’s content is available through channels and on-demand and is currently distributed to broadcast subscribers using either cable networks accessed through Telstra or Optus’s satellite platform via Foxtel’s set-top boxes, including the iQ4 (satellite and Internet Protocol (IP) only) and iQ3. The Foxtel Group intends to migrate all broadcast subscribers to satellite or internet delivery over the next several years. Broadcast subscribers can also access Foxtel’s content using Foxtel GO, a companion service app on mobile devices and tablets. In addition, the Foxtel Group offers video content via the internet through its Kayo, BINGE and Foxtel Now streaming services, which are available on a number of devices. The Foxtel Group also offers a bundled broadband product, which consists of Foxtel’s broadcast pay-TV service, sold together with an unlimited broadband service (predominantly on the National Broadband Network), and an option for customers to add home phone services. In addition to its subscription television services, the Foxtel Group operates foxsports.com.au, a leading general sports news website in Australia, and Watch NRL and Watch AFL, subscription services that provide live streaming and on-demand replays of National Rugby League and Australian Football League matches internationally. 

The Foxtel Group generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue from its pay-TV and streaming services as well as advertising revenue. For the year ended June 30, 2021, subscription revenues from the Foxtel Group’s streaming services, which include Kayo, BINGE, Foxtel Now and other streaming products, represented 14% of total circulation and subscription revenues at the Subscription Video Services segment. The Foxtel Group’s business generally is not highly seasonal, though results can fluctuate due to the timing and mix of its local and international sports programming, as expenses associated with licensing certain programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information regarding certain key performance indicators for the Foxtel Group. 

1 Channel count includes standard definition channels, high definition versions of those channels, audio channels and two 4K Ultra HD channels.

4
The Foxtel Group competes primarily with a variety of other video content providers, such as traditional Free To Air (“FTA”) TV operators in Australia, including the three major commercial FTA networks and two major government-funded FTA broadcasters, and content providers that deliver video programming over the internet to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile and other devices. These providers include IP television, or IPTV, subscription video-on-demand, or SVOD, and broadcast video-on-demand, or BVOD, services; streaming services offered through digital media providers; as well as programmers and distributors that provide content, including smaller, lower-cost or free programming packages, directly to consumers over the internet. The Company believes that the Foxtel Group’s premium service and exclusive content, wide array of products and services, set-top box features that enable subscribers to record, rewind, discover and watch content, its integration of third-party apps and its investment in On Demand capability and programming enable it to offer subscribers a compelling alternative to its competitors. Its streaming services, including Kayo, BINGE and Foxtel Now, provide a diversified portfolio of subscription television services that allow the Foxtel Group to provide services targeted at a wide range of Australian consumers.

Australian News Channel 

ANC operates nine channels and has carriage rights for two additional channels in Australia featuring the latest in news, politics, sports, entertainment, public affairs, business and weather. ANC is licensed by Sky International AG to use Sky trademarks and domain names in connection with its operation and distribution of channels and services. ANC’s channels consist of Fox Sports News, Sky News Live, Sky News Weather, Sky News Extra, Sky News Extra 1, Sky News Extra 2, Sky News Extra 3, Sky News New Zealand and Sky News on WIN. ANC channels are distributed throughout Australia and New Zealand and available on Foxtel and Sky Network Television NZ. Sky News on WIN is available on the regional FTA WIN network in Australia. ANC also owns and operates the international Australia Channel IPTV service and offers content across a variety of digital media platforms, including web, mobile and third party providers. ANC primarily generates revenue through monthly affiliate fees received from pay-TV providers based on the number of subscribers and advertising. 

ANC competes primarily with other news providers in Australia and New Zealand via its subscription television channels, third party content arrangements and free domain website. Its Australia Channel IPTV service also competes against subscription-based streaming news providers in regions outside of Australia and New Zealand. 

Dow Jones

The Company's Dow Jones segment is a global provider of news and business information, which distributes its content and data through a variety of media channels including newspapers, newswires, websites, apps for mobile devices, tablets and e-book readers, newsletters, magazines, proprietary databases, live journalism, video and podcasts.

The Dow Jones segment’s revenue is diversified across business-to-consumer and business-to-business subscriptions, circulation, advertising, including custom content and sponsorships, licensing fees for its print and digital products and participation fees for its live journalism events. Advertising revenues at the Dow Jones segment are subject to seasonality, with revenues typically highest in the Company’s second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season

Consumer Products

Through its premier brands and authoritative journalism, the Dow Jones segment’s products targeting individual consumers provide insights, research and understanding that enable consumers to stay informed and make educated financial decisions. As consumer preferences for content consumption evolve, the Dow Jones segment continues to capitalize on new digital distribution platforms, technologies and business models for these products, including distribution of content through licensing arrangements with third party subscription and non-subscription platform providers such as Facebook and Google, which is referred to as off-platform distribution. With a focus on the financial markets, investing and other professional services, many of these products offer advertisers an attractive consumer demographic. Products targeting consumers include the following:

•The Wall Street Journal (WSJ). WSJ, Dow Jones’s flagship product, is available in print, online and across multiple mobile, tablet and e-book devices. WSJ covers national and international news and provides analysis, commentary and opinions on a wide range of topics, including business developments and trends, economics, financial markets, investing, science and technology, lifestyle, culture and sports.

WSJ’s digital products offer both free content and premium, subscription-only content and are comprised of WSJ.com, WSJ mobile products, including a responsive design website and apps for multiple mobile devices (WSJ Mobile), and live and on-demand video through WSJ.com and other platforms such as YouTube, internet-connected television and set-top boxes (WSJ Video), as well as podcasts. For the year ended June 30, 2021, WSJ Mobile (including WSJ.com accessed via mobile devices, 

5
as well as apps, and excluding off-platform distribution) accounted for approximately 67% of visits to WSJ’s digital news and information products according to Adobe Analytics.

•Barron’s Group. The Barron’s Group focuses on Dow Jones consumer brands outside of The Wall Street Journal franchise, including Barron’s and MarketWatch, among other properties.

The Dow Jones segment offers a number of in-person and virtual conferences and events each year, including WSJ Tech D-Live, its C-suite conferences such as CEO and CFO Council, the Women In series, the Future Of series, Global Food Forum and Barron’s Group Summits. These live journalism events offer advertisers and sponsors the opportunity to reach a select group of influential leaders from industry, finance, government and policy. Many of these programs also earn revenue from participation fees charged to attendees.*

* Due to the impacts of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, certain live journalism events that were scheduled to take place in person have instead been offered as interactive virtual events and others have been postponed or cancelled.

This content also reaches millions of individual investors via customer portals and the intranets of brokerage and trading firms, as well as digital media publishers. Dow Jones Newswires is also increasingly used as an input for algorithms supporting automated trading.

The Dow Jones segment’s businesses compete with a wide range of media businesses, including print publications, digital media and information services.

The Dow Jones segment’s consumer products, including its newspapers, magazines, digital publications, podcasts and video, compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and app-based media, magazines, social media sources and podcasts, as well as other media such as television, radio stations and outdoor displays. Competition for 

7
subscriptions and circulation is based on news and editorial content, data and analytics content in research tools, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. Competition for advertising is based upon advertisers’ judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors, including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates, advertising effectiveness and brand strength and reputation. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, and corresponding changes in consumer behavior, the consumer-focused businesses within the Dow Jones segment continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue, including from a variety of alternative news and information sources. These include both paid and free websites, digital apps, news aggregators, customized news feeds, blogs, podcasts, search engines, social media networks, programmatic advertising buying channels, as well as other emerging media and distribution platforms, including off-platform distribution of its products. Shifts in consumer behavior require the Company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. The Company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges, and that it is well positioned to leverage its global reach, brand recognition and proprietary technology to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes.

The Dow Jones segment’s professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers and global financial newswires, including Reuters News, LexisNexis and Refinitiv, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data.

Book Publishing 

The Company’s Book Publishing segment consists of HarperCollins, the second largest consumer book publisher in the world based on global revenue, with operations in 17 countries. HarperCollins publishes and distributes consumer books globally through print, digital and audio formats. Its digital formats include e-books and downloadable audio books for tablets, e-book readers and mobile devices. HarperCollins owns more than 120 branded imprints, including Harper, William Morrow, HarperCollins Children’s Books, Avon, Harlequin and Christian publishers Zondervan and Thomas Nelson. In May 2021, HarperCollins acquired Houghton Mifflin Harcourt’s Books & Media segment (“HMH”), adding renowned and awarded children’s, young adult, fiction, non-fiction, culinary and reference titles to its extensive catalog. 

HarperCollins publishes works by well-known authors such as Harper Lee, George Orwell, Agatha Christie and Zora Neale Hurston, as well as global author brands including J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Daniel Silva, Karin Slaughter and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It is also home to many beloved children’s books and authors, including Goodnight Moon, Curious George, Little Blue Truck, Pete the Cat and David Walliams.

HarperCollins publishes fiction and nonfiction, with a focus on general, children’s and religious content. Additionally, in the U.K., HarperCollins publishes titles for the equivalent of the K-12 educational market. 

As of June 30, 2021, HarperCollins offered approximately 140,000 publications in digital formats, and nearly all of HarperCollins’ new titles, as well as the majority of its entire catalog, are available as e-books. Digital sales, comprising revenues generated through the sale of e-books as well as downloadable audio books, represented approximately 22% of global consumer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. With the widespread adoption of electronic formats by consumers, HarperCollins is publishing a number of titles in digital formats before, or instead of, publishing a print edition. 

During fiscal 2021, HarperCollins U.S. had 197 titles2 on the New York Times print and digital bestseller lists, with 29 titles hitting number one, including The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse by Charlie Mackesy, The Duke and I and The Viscount Who Loved Me by Julia Quinn, The Order by Daniel Silva, The Hate U Give and Concrete Rose by Angie Thomas, The One and Only Bob and The One and Only Ivan by Katherine Applegate, They Both Die at The End by Adam Silvera, Class Act and New Kid by Jerry Craft, I Am Enough by Grace Byers, Magnolia Table, Volume 2 by Joanna Gaines, Strange Planet by Nathan W Pyle, The Women of The Bible Speak by Shannon Bream, Realm Breaker by Victoria Aveyard, Forgiving What You Can’t Forget by Lysa TerKeurst and The Happy in a Hurry Cookbook by Steve and Kathy Doocy. 

HarperCollins derives its revenue from the sale of print and digital books to a customer base that includes global technology companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble and Tesco. Revenues at the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of HarperCollins’ books in the marketplace, and are typically highest during the Company’s second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies.

The book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations. HarperCollins competes with other large publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster and Hachette Livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants as barriers to entry in book publishing are low. In addition, HarperCollins competes for consumers with other media formats and sources such as movies, television programming, magazines and mobile content. The Company believes HarperCollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies. 

News Media

The Company’s News Media segment consists primarily of News Corp Australia, News UK and the New York Post. This segment also includes Wireless Group, operator of talkSPORT, the leading sports radio network in the U.K., and Virgin Radio, and Storyful, a social media content agency that enables the Company to source real-time video content through social media platforms. The News Media segment generates revenue primarily through sales of print and digital advertising and circulation and subscription sales of its print and digital products. Advertising revenues at the News Media segment are subject to seasonality, with revenues typically highest in the Company’s second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies.

News Corp Australia

News Corp Australia is one of the leading news and information providers in Australia by readership, with both print and digital mastheads covering a national, regional and suburban footprint.

Governmental Regulation

General

Various aspects of the Company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company’s products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on the Company’s interests.

Australian Media Regulation

The Company’s subscription television interests are subject to Australia’s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry, including the Australian Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (the “Broadcasting Services Act”) and the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) (the “Telecommunications Act”) and associated Codes. The key regulatory body for the Australian broadcasting industry is the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

Key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions—currently under the ‘anti-siphoning’ provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act, subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the Olympic Games and certain Australian Rules football and cricket matches) unless national or commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event or the rights are held by commercial television licensees whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50% of the Australian population or the rights are held by one of Australia’s two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) other parts of the Broadcasting Services Act that may impact the Company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. Foxtel is also subject to various consumer protection regimes under the Telecommunications Act and associated Codes, which apply to Foxtel as a telecommunications service provider.

Data Privacy and Security

The Company’s business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. For example, in the U.S., certain of the Company’s websites, mobile apps and other online business activities are subject to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which prohibits the collection of personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements. More state and local governments are also expanding, enacting or proposing data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and increase penalties and afford private rights of action to individuals in certain circumstances for failure to comply, and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which will amend the CCPA in January 2023, establish certain transparency rules, put greater restrictions on how the Company can collect, use and share personal information of California residents and provide California residents with certain rights regarding their personal information. The CCPA and forthcoming CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Similarly, the recently-enacted Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”) imposes transparency and other obligations with respect to personal data of Virginia consumers and provides Virginia residents with similar rights, with the exception of a private right of action.

Similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the European Union, the U.K. and Australia. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which provides a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the European Union, and the U.K. adopted the Data Protection Act of 2018 (the “UK DPA”), implementing the GDPR. The GDPR and the UK DPA expand the regulation of the collection, processing, use, sharing and security of personal data, contain stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthen the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continue to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, require companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, require mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increase maximum penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million Euros or 17 million pounds, as applicable, or 4% of an entity’s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increase the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. The European Union also plans to replace its existing e-Privacy Directive with a new e-Privacy Regulation that will complement the GDPR and amend certain rules, including with respect to cookies and other similar technologies that the Company utilizes to obtain information from visitors to the Company’s various digital 

11
properties. It is not yet clear whether the U.K. will make corresponding changes to its existing Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, which implemented the e-Privacy Directive in the U.K.

The Company and some of its service providers rely on certain mechanisms to address the European data protection requirements for transfers of data, such as the European Union Standard Contractual Clauses, that are evolving and often subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. In June 2021, the European Commission adopted new sets of European Union Standard Contractual Clauses, which regulate the relationship between controller and processor in accordance with the GDPR and international data transfers to a third country in the absence of an adequacy decision under the GDPR. The European Data Protection Board also adopted recommendations on measures that supplement data transfer tools to ensure compliance with the level of personal data protection required in Europe, including requirements for data exporters to assess the risks related to the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area and to implement, if necessary, additional contractual, organizational and technical measures such as encryption and pseudonymization. Such evolving frameworks could cause the Company to incur additional costs, require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services.

In Australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration.

Industry participants in the U.S., Europe and Australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the Company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior.

The interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain, in flux, and evolving in the United States and internationally. Moreover, data privacy and security laws vary between local, state, federal and international jurisdictions and may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The Company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the Company’s data privacy and security compliance programs.

U.K. Press Regulation

As a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, a Press Recognition Panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established. Once approved by the Press Recognition Panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. In addition to the Press Recognition Panel, certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and, if Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 is commenced, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances.

Press regulator IMPRESS was recognized as an approved regulator by the Press Recognition Panel on October 25, 2016. However, publications representing the majority of the industry in the U.K., including News UK, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, or IPSO, in September 2014. IPSO currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the Press Recognition Panel. IPSO has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. IPSO oversees the Editors’ Code of Practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the Editors’ Code of Practice and levy fines of up to £1 million. IPSO has also introduced an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. The burdens IPSO imposes on its print media members, including the Company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the U.K., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance.

U.K. Radio Broadcasting Regulation

The Company’s radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the Company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. Although the Company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Non-compliance by the Company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions.

12
Intellectual Property

The Company’s intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, video programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. These licenses include: (1) the sports programming rights licenses for the National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Australia, V8 Supercars, Formula One and other broadcasting rights described in Note 16 to the Financial Statements; (2) licenses from various third parties of patents and other technology for the set-top boxes and related operating and conditional access systems used in the Company’s subscription television business; (3) the trademark license for the realtor.com® website address, as well as the REALTOR® trademark (the “NAR License”); and (4) the trademark licenses for the use of FOX formative trademarks used in the Company’s pay-TV business in Australia (the “Fox Licenses”). In addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. The Company derives value and revenue from its intellectual property assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, subscriptions to its pay-TV services and distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to other television services, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services and the operation of websites and other digital properties.

The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other foreign territories. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. Policing unauthorized use of the Company’s products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Company’s intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit the threat of piracy by, among other means, preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions. The Company also seeks to limit such threat to its intellectual property by pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. However, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company also engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement.

Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company’s intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations.

Raw Materials

As a major publisher of newspapers, magazines and books, the Company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. In order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the Company’s paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. The Company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate.

Human Capital

News Corp provides communities with the news, information and entertainment they need and demand, and its workforce is critical to the creation and delivery of its premium and trusted content and the success of the company. The Company’s ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees with the skills and capabilities needed by its businesses is a key component of its long-term strategy to become more global and more digital.

As of June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately 24,000 employees, of whom approximately 8,500 were located in the U.S., 5,000 were located in the U.K. and 7,500 were located in Australia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company transitioned approximately 90% of its employees to remote working, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. Of the Company’s employees, approximately 4,500 were represented by various employee unions. The contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. The Company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good. 

13
The capabilities of the Company’s workforce have continued to evolve along with the Company’s business and strategy, including becoming more digital. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pace of this evolution increased, as changing consumer behavior accelerated the shift in the Company’s workforce allocation towards digital products and services. The Company also implemented a transformation initiative to streamline operations and reduce costs across back office functions, including the introduction of common technology platforms, standardizing internal processes, outsourcing various activities and rationalizing its real estate footprint, which it expects to increase collaboration across its businesses worldwide and optimize the productivity and efficiency of its workforce. 

Culture and Values

The delivery of quality news, information and entertainment to customers is a passionate, principled and purposeful enterprise. The Company believes people around the globe turn to News Corp because they trust its dedication to those values and to conducting business with integrity. The Company is always mindful that one of its greatest assets is its reputation, and ethical conduct is part of the vision, strategy and fabric of the Company. The Company has established a Compliance Steering Committee that oversees the Company’s global compliance-related policies, protocols and guidance and reports directly to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee. Performance on ethics and compliance objectives is evaluated in determining the payout of incentive compensation for executive officers. In addition, all employees are required to regularly complete training on, and affirm compliance with, the News Corp Standards of Business Conduct, which confirm the Company’s policy to conduct its affairs in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and observe the highest standards of business ethics. The Standards of Business Conduct are reviewed regularly and approved by the Board of Directors, and are complemented by business-unit and topic-specific policies and trainings, including with respect to workplace conduct, conflicts of interest, anti-corruption and anti-bribery and insider trading. 

Diversity and Inclusion

The Company recognizes that the unique experiences and perspectives of its employees across its various businesses are critical to creating brands and products that reflect a diversity of viewpoints and engage and inspire customers all over the world, and the Company seeks to foster an environment where all employees can feel valued, included and empowered to bring great ideas to the table. To achieve this, the Company is committed to cultivating diversity and broadening opportunities for inclusion across its businesses. As of December 31, 2020, women represented 48% of News Corp’s global workforce, 40% of its senior executives6 and 33% of its Board of Directors. Although the Company has made progress in its workforce diversity representation, it seeks to continuously improve in this area through its recruitment practices, employee development and mentoring and inclusivity programs, and all of the Company’s business units have implemented diversity and inclusion programs and practices tailored to their respective industries and geographies. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors assesses the Company’s progress towards its diversity and inclusion objectives on an annual basis and reports on its review to the Board of Directors.

Compensation and Benefits

News Corp’s compensation and benefits programs, which vary based on business unit and geographic location, are focused on attracting, retaining and motivating the top talent necessary to achieve its mission in ways that reflect its diverse global workforce’s needs and priorities. In addition to competitive salaries, the Company and its businesses have established short- and long-term incentive programs designed to motivate and reward performance against key business objectives and facilitate retention. News Corp also provides a range of retirement benefits based on competitive regional benchmarks and other comprehensive benefit options to meet the needs of its employees, including healthcare benefits, tax advantaged savings vehicles, life and disability insurance, paid time off, flexible working arrangements, generous parental leave policies and a company match for charitable donations. To support their employees through the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of business units provided enhanced benefits and implemented additional wellness programs, such as: the launch of a Community Online Academy, which offers free virtual classes weekly to help employees and their families improve their physical and mental well-being, as well as flexible work schedules, home office equipment reimbursements, enhanced child care benefits and ClassPass at Home, through which employees can access free live-streaming and on-demand exercise programs.

Training and Development

News Corp invests significant resources in training and development programs designed to enable its employees to develop the skills and leadership necessary to execute on the Company’s strategy and engage and retain top talent. News Corp employees 

6 Comprising the Company’s Executive Chairman, Chief Executive, headquarters leadership team and chief executive officers of its primary operating companies, and executives directly reporting to each of the foregoing.

14
have access to a range of training opportunities, including workshops and classes on a variety of topics, webinars, job-specific training and other continuing education resources. The Company further supports and develops its employees through career planning resources and programs that build and strengthen employee leadership skills. In addition, the Company and its businesses have implemented programs to support regular performance reviews for employees to highlight their strengths and identify the skills and growth areas necessary to advance their careers. These programs help the Company identify and invest in the next generation of leadership and represent an important component in the development of its talent pipeline.

Explanatory Note Regarding Certain Metrics

Unique Users

For purposes of this Annual Report, the Company counts unique users the first time an individual accesses a product’s website using a browser during a calendar month and the first time an individual accesses a product’s mobile or tablet app using a mobile or tablet device during a calendar month. If the user accesses more than one of a product’s desktop websites, mobile websites, mobile apps and/or tablet apps, the first access to each such website or app is counted as a separate unique user. In addition, users accessing a product’s websites through different browsers, users who clear their browser cache at any time and users who access a product’s websites and apps through different devices are also counted as separate unique users. For a group of products such as WSJDN, a user accessing different products within the group is counted as a separate unique user for each product accessed.

Broadcast Subscribers

Broadcast subscribers consist of residential subscribers and commercial subscribers, which are calculated as described below.

Residential Subscribers

Total number of residential subscribers represents total residential subscribers to the Company’s pay-TV services through cable and satellite distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships.

Commercial Subscribers

Commercial subscribers for the Company’s pay-TV business are calculated as residential equivalent business units, which are derived by dividing total recurring revenue from these subscribers by an estimated average Broadcast ARPU which is held constant through the year. Total number of commercial subscribers represents total commercial subscribers to the Company’s pay-TV services through cable and satellite distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships.

Broadcast ARPU

The Company calculates Broadcast ARPU for its pay-TV business by dividing broadcast package revenues for the period, net of customer credits, promotions and other discounts, by average cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period and dividing by the number of months in the period. Average cable and satellite residential subscribers, or “Average Broadcast Subscribers,” for a given period is calculated by first adding the beginning and ending cable and satellite residential subscribers for each month in the period and dividing by two and then adding each of those monthly average subscriber numbers and dividing by the number of months in the period.

Broadcast Subscriber Churn

The Company calculates Broadcast Subscriber Churn for its pay-TV business by dividing the total number of disconnected cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period, net of reconnects and transfers, by the Average Broadcast Subscribers for the period, calculated as described above. This amount is then divided by the number of days in the period and multiplied by 365 days to present churn on an annual basis.

Paid Subscribers

A paid subscriber to the Company’s streaming services is one for which the Company recognized subscription revenue. A subscriber ceases to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Paid subscribers excludes customers receiving service for no charge under certain new subscriber promotions.
