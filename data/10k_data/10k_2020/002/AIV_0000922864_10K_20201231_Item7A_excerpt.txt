ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our chief market risks are refunding risk, that is the availability of property debt or other cash sources to refund maturing property debt, including the Notes Payable to AIR, and repricing risk, that is the possibility of increases in base interest rates and credit risk spreads. We use long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing, non-recourse property debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short-term borrowings. We use working capital primarily to fund short-term uses. We make limited use of derivative financial instruments and we do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes. 

Market Risk  

As of December 31, 2020, we had $55.0 million of variable-rate property-level debt outstanding. We estimate that a change in 30-day LIBOR of 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads would reduce or increase interest expense by approximately $0.6 million on an annual basis.  

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $298.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, a portion of which bears interest at variable rates. 

We estimate the fair value of debt instruments as described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. The estimated fair value of total indebtedness, including our Notes Payable to AIR, was approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020.
