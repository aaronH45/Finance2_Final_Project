PART I

Item 1. Business. 

Overview

Founded in 1904, Coty Inc. is one of the world’s largest beauty companies with an iconic portfolio of brands across fragrance, color cosmetics, and skin and body care. Through targeted strategic transactions, the Company has strengthened and diversified its presence across the countries, categories and channels in which we compete, building a strong beauty platform. The King Kylie and Kim Kardashian West transactions complement our existing portfolio as personality-led Direct-to-Consumer (“DTC”) business models with strong social media engines. As we transform the Company, we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities, including stabilizing our consumer beauty brands through leading innovation and improved execution, accelerating our prestige fragrance brands and ongoing expansion into prestige cosmetics, building a comprehensive skincare portfolio leveraging existing brands, enhancing our e-commerce and DTC capabilities, expanding our presence in China through prestige products and select consumer beauty brands, and establishing Coty as an industry leader in sustainability.

On November 30, 2020, the Company completed the previously announced strategic transaction with Rainbow UK Bidco Limited (“KKR Bidco”) (an affiliate of funds and/or separately managed accounts (“KKR Funds”) advised and/or managed by Kolberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and its affiliates (“KKR”)), for the sale of a majority stake in Coty’s Professional and Retail Hair business, including the Wella, Clairol, OPI and ghd brands, (together, the “Wella Business”). As a result Coty owns a 40% stake in Rainbow JVCO LTD and subsidiaries (together, “Wella”).

As previously reported, we are implementing a comprehensive transformation agenda (the “Transformation Plan”) which aims to stabilize and accelerate revenue growth, improve our profitability through gross margin growth and cost control, optimize our operating model for speed and agility, accelerate e-commerce and digital growth, and deleverage our balance sheet. This Transformation Plan is designed to adjust our cost base to allow us to exit the post-COVID recovery phase as a financially and operationally stronger, more nimble company, which is well positioned to capture growth opportunities. We are continually reviewing ways to accelerate and amplify the transformation of the Company, including through the implementation of additional initiatives in connection with our Transformation Plan.

All dollar amounts in the following discussion are in millions of United States (“U.S.”) dollars, unless otherwise indicated.

Segments

Operating and reportable segments (referred to as “segments”) reflect the way the Company is managed and for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company has designated its Chief Executive Officer as the CODM.

The Company’s three segments for its continuing operations are: Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific include the businesses focused on prestige fragrances, prestige skin care, prestige cosmetics, mass color cosmetics, mass fragrance, mass skin care and body care, and are supported by central marketing teams.

As previously disclosed, the Company’s CODM is in the process of finalizing her organization structure and how she will assess performance, and the Company has concurrently evaluated the potential impact to its segment reporting. Based on this evaluation, the Company has determined that it is appropriate to realign its reportable segments from the current regional structure to a principally product category-based structure, comprised of a prestige business segment and a consumer beauty business segment. The Company is in the process of making corresponding changes, as needed, to its management structure and operating responsibilities as well as to its information systems to enable appropriate internal and external financial reporting reflecting such newly identified segments by the first quarter of its fiscal year 2022.

For segment financial information and information about our long-lived assets, see Note 5— Segment Reporting in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and for information about recent acquisitions or dispositions, see Note 4—Business Combinations, Asset Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Brands 

The following chart reflects our iconic brand portfolio:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Marketing

We have a diverse portfolio of brands, some owned and some licensed, and we employ different models to create a distinct image and personality suited to each brand’s equity, distribution, product focus and consumer. For our licensed brands, we work with licensors to promote brand image. Each of our brands is promoted with logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and the uniqueness of each brand. We manage our creative marketing work through a combination of our in-house teams and external agencies that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand. 

We promote our brands through various channels to reach and engage beauty consumers, through traditional media, through in-store displays, on digital and social media, and through collaborations, product placements and events. In addition, we seek editorial coverage for products and brands in both traditional media and digital and social media to drive influencer amplification and to build brand equity. We also leverage our relationships with celebrities and on-line influencers to endorse certain of our products. Our marketing efforts benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers, often in connection with in-store marketing activities designed to engage consumers so that they try, or purchase, our products, including sampling and “gift-with-purchase” programs designed to stimulate product trials. 

We have dedicated marketing and sales forces in most of our significant markets. These teams leverage local insights to strategically promote our brands and product offerings and tailor our creative marketing to fit local tastes and resonate with consumers most effectively.

We utilize in-depth brand and market data analytics to develop branding, merchandising and marketing execution strategies to maximize the consumer experience and build a better business. We have begun to concentrate working media resources in a select number of brand/country combinations, which we believe represents a significant opportunity for revenue and gross margin improvement, and to implement a tactical, in-store strategy for the others.

Distribution Channels and Retail Sales

We market, sell and distribute our products in approximately 130 countries and territories, with dedicated local sales forces in most of our significant markets. We have a balanced multi-channel distribution strategy which complements our product categories. Our mass beauty brands are primarily sold through hypermarkets, supermarkets, drug stores and pharmacies, mid-tier department stores, traditional food and drug retailers, and dedicated e-commerce retailers. The prestige products are primarily sold through prestige retailers, including perfumeries, department stores, e-retailers, direct-to-consumer websites and duty-free shops. Due to the impact of COVID-19 and as part of our strategic initiatives, we have focused on expanding our e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels. We also sell our products through third-party distributors. In fiscal 2021, no retailer accounted for more than 10% of our global net revenues; however, certain retailers accounted for more than 10% of net revenues within certain geographic markets and segments. In fiscal 2021, Walmart, our top retailer, accounted for approximately 7% of total Coty Inc. net revenues from continuing operations. 

Innovation

Innovation is a pillar of our business. We innovate through brand-building and new product lines, as well as through new technology. Our research and development teams work with our marketing and operations teams to identify recent trends and consumer needs and to bring products quickly to market. 

We are continuously innovating to increase our sales by elevating our digital presence, including e-commerce and digital, social media and influencer marketing designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement. We have also focused our efforts on meeting evolving consumer shopping preferences and behaviors, both on-line and in-store. We have introduced new ways to customize the consumer experience, including using artificial intelligence-powered tools to provide personalized advice on selecting and using products, and augmented reality tools that invite customers to virtually try products with curated looks, tutorials and product recommendations. 

In addition, we continuously seek to improve our products through research and development. Our basic and applied research groups, which conduct longer-term and “blue sky” research, seek to develop proprietary new technologies for first-to-market products and for improving existing products. This research and development is done both internally and through affiliations with various universities, technical centers, supply partners, industry associations and technical associations. A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology. In addition, several of our products and/or packaging for our products are covered by design rights protections.

Our principal research and development centers are located in the U.S. and Europe. See “Item 2. Properties.”

We do not perform, nor do we commission any third parties on our behalf to perform, testing of our products or ingredients on animals except where required by law.

Supply Chain

During fiscal year 2021, we continued to manufacture and package approximately 85% of our products, primarily in facilities located in the United States, Brazil, China, Mexico and various countries in Europe. We recognize the importance of our employees at our manufacturing facilities and have in place programs designed to ensure operating safety. In addition, we implement programs designed to ensure that our manufacturing and distribution facilities comply with applicable environmental rules and regulations. To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis who produce approximately 15% of our finished products. As part of our ongoing Transformation Plan, we are exploring options to further optimize our supply chain operations.

The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are primarily essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals. The essential oils in our fragrance products are generally sourced from fragrance houses. As a result, we realize material cost savings and benefits from the technology, innovation and resources provided by these fragrance houses.

We purchase the raw materials for all our products from various third parties. We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications. We collaborate with our suppliers to meet our stringent design and creative criteria. We believe that we currently have adequate sources of supply for all our products. 

We have experienced disruptions in our supply chain from time to time, including in connection with our past restructuring efforts, and we work to anticipate and respond to actual and potential disruptions.

Competition

There is significant competition within each market where our products are sold. We compete against manufacturers and marketers of beauty products, salon professional nail products and personal care products. In addition to the established multinational brands against which we compete, small targeted niche brands continue to enter the beauty market. We also have competition from private label products sold by retailers.

We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of perceived value, including pricing and innovation, product efficacy, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce initiatives, direct sales and other activities (including influencers). It is difficult for us to predict the timing, scale and effectiveness of our competitors’ actions in these areas or the timing and impact of new entrants into the marketplace. For additional risks associated with our competitive position, see “Risk Factors—The beauty industry is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation could suffer”. 

Intellectual Property

We generally own or license the trademark rights in key sales countries in Trademark International Class 3 (covering cosmetics and perfumery) for use in connection with our brands. When we license trademark rights we generally enter into long-term licenses, and we are generally the exclusive trademark licensee for all Class 3 trademarks as used in connection with our products. We or our licensors, as the case may be, actively protect the trademarks used in our principal products in the U.S. and significant markets worldwide. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be essential to our business.

A number of our products also incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology in their respective formulations and/or packaging, and in some cases our product packaging is subject to copyright, trade dress or design protection. While we consider our patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of related patents or copyrights, is material to the conduct of our business. 

Products representing 61% of our fiscal 2021 net revenues from continuing operations are manufactured and marketed under exclusive license agreements granted to us for use on a worldwide and/or regional basis. As of June 30, 2021, we maintained 25 brand licenses. In addition, approximately 51% of our fiscal 2021 net revenues from continuing operations were attributable to prestige fragrance, of which approximately 80% was from our top six prestige fragrance brands.

Our licenses impose obligations and restrictions on us that we believe are common to many licensing relationships in the beauty industry, such as paying annual royalties on net sales of the licensed products, maintaining the quality of the licensed products and the image of the applicable trademarks, achievement of minimum sales levels, promotion of sales and qualifications and behavior of our suppliers, distributors and retailers. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with the terms of our material brand license agreements.

Most brand licenses have renewal options for one or more terms, which can range from two to ten years. Certain brand licenses provide for automatic extensions, so long as minimum annual royalty payments are made, while renewal of others is contingent upon attaining specified sales levels or upon agreement of the licensor. Three of our brand licenses are up for renewal during fiscal 2022 and require licensor approval. These three licenses together accounted for less than 1% of fiscal 2021 revenues from continuing operations. None of our top eight licenses is up for renewal contingent on licensor consent within the next five years. For additional risks associated with our licensing arrangements, see “Risk Factors—Our brand licenses may be terminated if specified conditions are not met, and we may not be able to renew expiring licenses on favorable terms or at all” and “Risk Factors—Our failure to protect our reputation, or the failure of our brand partners or licensors to protect their reputations, could have a material adverse effect on our brand images”.

Human Capital

Workforce. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 11,430 full-time employees in over 36 countries. In addition, we typically employ a large number of seasonal contractors during our peak manufacturing and promotional season. During fiscal year 2020, and to a lesser extent in fiscal year 2021, we adjusted our workforce through furlough or other reduction as we implemented our response to COVID-19. We expect our overall headcount, as well as the use of seasonal contractors, to decrease as we continue our efforts to restructure and rationalize our business in connection with our Transformation Plan, including through outsourcing initiatives and strategic transactions.

Our employees in the U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our employees in certain countries in Europe are subject to works council arrangements and collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a material strike or work stoppage in the U.S. or any other country where we have a significant number of employees.

Our employees are a key source of competitive advantage and their actions, guided by our Code of Conduct and our global compliance program, Behave Beautifully, are critical to the long-term success of our business. We recognize the importance of our employees to our business and believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. As a beauty company, we believe that it is important for our workforce to reflect the diversity of our consumers and to be representative of society as a whole. We firmly believe that an inclusive work environment is essential for a successful and thriving business, by enabling us to better understand our consumers and to drive innovation and creativity. We recognize the importance of diversity at a leadership level and throughout our organization – including diversity of gender, ethnicity, ability, background, gender identity and sexual orientation. 

Our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy is one of the three pillars of our dedicated sustainability strategy, Beauty that Lasts. Launched in February 2020, this strategy includes time-bound targets to accelerate our progress on a number of issues including diversity, equal pay, advocacy and awareness, training and community outreach. As part of our overall efforts to increase the diversity of our leadership team, we aspire to reach a 50:50 gender balance in our leadership positions and to reduce gender pay gaps across our organization by 2025. We are progressing towards this goal; since Sue Nabi joined as Chief Executive Officer in September 2020, we have a majority representation of women at the executive committee level. 

Oversight. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight on certain human capital matters including diversity and inclusion strategy, executive compensation, retention and succession planning and human resources strategies in connection with talent management. In addition, in connection with the Beauty that Lasts program, we established a Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion project team responsible for developing and implementing a three-year roadmap with both global and local strategic objectives relating to our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. 

Sustainability

We launched our dedicated sustainability strategy, Beauty That Lasts, in February 2020, which is guided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to manage and reduce our environmental impact and accelerate positive change. During fiscal 2021, we affirmed this commitment by including our goal of becoming a beauty leader in sustainability as one of the six strategic pillars driving our overall strategy. We report annually on our progress towards our sustainability targets, and our sustainability reports and other information on our sustainability initiatives and achievements are available on our website. The content of our sustainability reports and information on our website are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. 

Government Regulation

We and our products are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies as well as by various state and local regulatory authorities and by the applicable regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, labeling, manufacturing, packaging, advertising and marketing and sales and distribution of our products. Because we have commercial operations overseas, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) as well as other countries’ anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act.

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to land and surface waters, generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. Compliance with such laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, environmental and social responsibility laws and regulations have tended to become increasingly stringent and, to the extent regulatory changes occur in the future, they could result in, among other things, increased costs and risks of non-compliance for us. For example, certain states in the U.S., such as California, and the U.S. Congress have proposed legislation relating to chemical disclosure and other requirements related to the content of our products. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business or products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Seasonality

The Company’s sales generally increase during the second fiscal quarter as a result of increased demand associated with the winter holiday season. Financial performance, working capital requirements, sales, cash flows and borrowings generally experience variability during the three to six months preceding the holiday season. Product innovations, new product launches and the size and timing of orders from the Company’s customers may also result in variability. However, the mix of product sales can vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of products, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors, as evidenced by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
