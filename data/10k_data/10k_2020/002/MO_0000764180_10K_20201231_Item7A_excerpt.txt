Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement are expected to be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or a mutually agreed upon benchmark rate, plus a percentage based on the higher of the ratings of Altria’s long-term senior unsecured debt from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. The applicable percentage based on Altria’s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings at December 31, 2020 for borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 1.0%. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Altria had no borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
