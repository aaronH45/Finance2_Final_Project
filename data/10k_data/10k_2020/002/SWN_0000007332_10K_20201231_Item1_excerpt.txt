PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Southwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively, “we”, “our”, “us”, “the Company” or “Southwestern”) is an independent energy company engaged in exploration, development and production activities, including the related marketing of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) produced in our operations. Southwestern is a holding company whose assets consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and whose business is conducted substantially through, its subsidiaries. Currently we operate exclusively in the United States. Our common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SWN.”

Southwestern, which is incorporated in Delaware, has its executive offices located at 10000 Energy Drive, Spring, Texas 77389, and can be reached by phone at 832-796-1000. The Company also maintains offices in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, Morgantown, West Virginia, and Zanesville, Ohio. 

Our Business Strategy

We aim to deliver sustainable and industry-leading returns through excellence in exploration and production and marketing performance from our extensive resource base and targeted expansion of our activities and assets along the hydrocarbon value chain. Our Company’s formula embodies our corporate philosophy and guides how we operate our business:

Our formula, “The Right People doing the Right Things, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying Assets will create Value+,” also guides our business strategy. We always strive to attract and retain strong talent, to work safely and act ethically with unwavering vigilance for the environment and the communities in which we operate, and to creatively apply technical skills, which we believe will grow long-term value for our shareholders. The arrow in our formula is not a straight line: we acknowledge that factors may adversely affect quarter-by-quarter results, but the path over time points to value creation.

In applying these core principles, we concentrate on:

•Financial Strength. We are committed to rigorously managing our balance sheet and financial risks. We budget and dynamically manage our operations in order to ensure that our investments do not exceed our cash flow from operations (net of changes in working capital) in each calendar year, protect our projected cash flows through hedging and continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. Our capital investment program in 2020 was supplemented with the remaining earmarked proceeds from the sale of our Fayetteville Shale assets in December 2018.

•Increasing Margins. We apply strong technical, operational, commercial and marketing skills to reduce costs, improve the productivity of our wells and pursue commercial arrangements to extract greater value. We believe our demonstrated ability to maximize margins, especially by leveraging the scale of our large assets, gives us a competitive advantage as we move into the future.

•Exercising Capital Allocation Discipline. We continually assess market conditions in order to adjust our capital allocation decisions to maximize shareholder returns. This allocation process includes consideration of multiple alternatives including but not limited to the development of our natural gas and oil assets, strategic mergers or acquisitions, reducing debt and returning capital to our shareholders.

•Operational Value Creation. We prepare an economic analysis for our drilling programs and other investments based upon the expected Internal Rate of Return. We target projects that generate the highest returns in excess of our cost of capital. This disciplined investment approach governs our investment decisions at all times, including the current lower-price commodity market.

•Dynamic Management of Assets Throughout Life Cycle. We own large-scale, long-life assets in various phases of development. In early stages, we ramp up development through technical, operational and commercial skills, and as they grow we look for ways to maximize their value through efficient operating practices along with applying our commercial and marketing expertise.

•Deepening Our Inventory. We continue to expand the inventory of properties that we can develop profitably by converting our extensive resources into proved reserves, targeting additions whose productivity largely has been demonstrated and improving efficiencies in production.

•The Hydrocarbon Value Chain.  We believe that our vertical integration enhances our margins and provides us competitive advantages. For example, we own and operate drilling rigs and well stimulation equipment and have invested in a water transportation project in West Virginia. These activities provide operational flexibility, lower our well costs, minimize the risk associated with the lack of availability of these resources from third parties and capture additional value over time.

•Technological Innovation. Our people constantly search for the next revolutionary technology and other operational advancements to capture greater value in unconventional hydrocarbon resource development. These developments – whether single, step-changing technologies or a combination of several incremental ones – can reduce finding and development costs and thus increase our margins.

•Environmental Solutions and Policy Formation.  We are a leader in identifying and implementing innovative solutions to unconventional hydrocarbon development to minimize the environmental and community impacts of our activities. We work extensively with governmental, non-governmental and industry stakeholders to develop responsible and cost-effective programs. We demonstrate that a company can operate responsibly and profitably, putting us in a better position to comply with new regulations as they evolve.

During 2020 we executed on these business strategies by:

•Expanding our portfolio in Appalachia by acquiring Montage Resources Corporation through an accretive all-stock transaction, increasing our economic inventory while recognizing immediate cost structure savings;

•Dynamically managing our operational focus from liquids to dry gas in response to adverse economic conditions, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to take advantage of more favorable commodity pricing;

•Lowering our costs through drilling, completions and operational efficiencies and optimizing gathering and transportation costs;

•Continuing to identify and implement structural, process and organizational changes to further reduce general and administrative costs;

•Maintaining a robust multi-year hedging program to ensure a certain level of cash flow;

•Focusing on delivering operational excellence with improved well productivity and economics from enhanced completion techniques, innovative water sourcing, optimization of surface equipment and managing reservoir drawdown;

•Repurchasing approximately $107 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for $72 million, recognizing a gain on the extinguishment of debt of $35 million; and

•Publishing our 7th Annual Corporate Responsibility report for 2019 (available at www.swn.com). Key environmental highlights include:

◦We reported the lowest greenhouse gas intensity among our Appalachian peers in the annual Environmental Health and Safety Survey;

◦Our methane intensity was 85% better than the target set by ONE Future (a coalition of 37 natural gas companies working together to voluntarily lower methane emissions); and

◦We were fresh water neutral for the fifth year in a row; 100% of our fresh water usage was offset through recycling and conservation projects.

Note that the information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this filing.

The bulk of our operations, which we refer to as “Exploration and Production” (“E&P”), are focused on the finding and development of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our marketing business, which we refer to as “Marketing.”

Exploration and Production

Overview

Our primary business is the exploration for, and production of, natural gas, oil and NGLs, with our current operations solely within the United States. We are currently focused on the development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Our operations in northeast Pennsylvania (herein referred to as “Northeast Appalachia”) are primarily focused on the unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale, and our operations in West Virginia, southwest Pennsylvania and Ohio (herein referred to as “Southwest Appalachia”) are focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas, oil and NGL reservoirs. Collectively, our properties located in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia are herein referred to as “Appalachia.”

•Our E&P segment recorded operating loss of $2,864 million in 2020, compared to operating income of $283 million in 2019. Our E&P segment operating income (loss) decreased $3,147 million in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to $2,825 million of non-cash full cost ceiling test impairments. Excluding the impact of ceiling test impairments, operating income (loss) decreased $322 million compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower margins associated with decreased commodity pricing.

•Our cash flow from operations was $372 million in 2020, compared to $781 million in 2019. This $409 million decrease was primarily due to a 20% decrease in weighted average commodity prices, including derivatives, partially offset by a 13% increase in production volumes. 

Oilfield Services Vertical Integration

We provide certain oilfield services that are strategic and economically beneficial for our E&P operations when our E&P activity levels and market pricing support these activities. This vertical integration lowers our well costs, allows us to operate efficiently, provides agility to our operations allowing us to react quickly to rapid changes in market conditions and helps us to mitigate certain operational and environmental risks. These services include drilling, completions and water management and movement. As of December 31, 2020, we operated a fleet of drilling rigs and leased two pressure pumping spreads with a total capacity of 72,000 horsepower. These assets provide us greater flexibility to align our operational activities with commodity prices. In 2020, we provided drilling rigs for all of our 98 drilled wells. In addition, we provided completions services utilizing one pressure pumping spread in Southwest Appalachia.

Our Proved Reserves

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Our existing tax attributes, including net operating losses and remaining depreciable tax basis related to our natural gas and oil properties, more than offset our future net operating income, resulting in no tax effect to our PV-10 calculation for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Table of Contents  

Index to Financial Statements

Our reserve estimates and the after-tax PV-10 measure, or standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserve quantities, are highly dependent upon the respective commodity price used in our reserve and after-tax PV-10 calculations.

•Our reserves decreased 6% in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in commodity pricing, partially offset by the reserves acquired from Montage.

•Our after-tax PV-10 value decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 as lower reserve levels resulted primarily from a decrease in SEC 12-month backward-looking commodity prices.

•We are the designated operator of approximately 97% of our reserves, based on the pre-tax PV-10 value of our proved developed producing reserves, and our reserve life index was approximately 11.3 years at year-end 2020, using an estimate of full year production from our recently acquired Montage properties.

The following table presents the PV-10 value of our reported year-end 2020 reserves balance using SEC 12-month backward-looking prices and the 12-month forward-looking strip prices as of January 4, 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Adjusted for market differentials.

The difference in after-tax PV-10 and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is reconciled in the 2020 Proved Reserves by Category and Summary Operating Data table below) is the discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows. Our existing tax attributes, including net operating losses and remaining depreciable tax basis related to our natural gas and oil properties, more than offset our future net operating income, resulting in no tax effect to our PV-10 calculation for the year ended December 31, 2020.

We believe that the pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our estimated proved reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax PV-10 value. Pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors that are comparable from company to company, while the after-tax PV-10 is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company. We understand that securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of a company’s current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. We refer you to “Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures” in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of our standardized measure of discounted future cash flows related to our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, to the risk factor “Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties. Any material change to these uncertainties or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measures and estimated reserve data.

Lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices reduce the value of our assets, both by a direct reduction in what the production could be sold for and by making some properties uneconomic, resulting in decreases to the overall value of our reserves and potential non-cash impairment charges to earnings. Further non-cash impairments in future periods could occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices decrease as compared to the average used in prior periods.

The following table provides an overall and categorical summary of our natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, as of year-end 2020 based on average year prices, and our well count, net acreage and PV-10 as of December 31, 2020, and sets forth 2020 annual information related to production and capital investments for each of our operating areas:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Other reserves and acreage consists primarily of properties in Colorado. 

(2)We have no reserves from synthetic gas, synthetic oil or nonrenewable natural resources intended to be upgraded into synthetic gas or oil. We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methodologies in determining estimates of material properties, including performance and test date analysis, offset statistical analogy of performance data, volumetric evaluation, including analysis of petrophysical parameters (including porosity, net pay, fluid saturations (i.e., water, oil and gas) and permeability) in combination with estimated reservoir parameters (including reservoir temperature and pressure, formation depth and formation volume factors), geological analysis, including structure and isopach maps and seismic analysis, including review of 2-D and 3-D data to ascertain faults, closure and other factors.

(3)Other capital investments includes $9 million related to our water infrastructure project, $16 million related to our E&P service companies and $2 million related to other developmental activities.

(4)Excludes 587 wells in Northeast Appalachia and 99 wells in Southwest Appalachia in which we only have an overriding royalty interest. These wells were included in the December 31, 2020 reserves calculation.

(5)Excludes exploration licenses for 2,518,519 net acres in New Brunswick, Canada, which have been subject to a moratorium since 2015. We are currently working with Canadian officials to extend our licenses, although we cannot assure that the licenses will be extended past March 2021.

(6)Pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure) is one measure of the value of a company’s proved reserves that we believe is used by securities analysts to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. The reconciling difference in pre-tax PV-10 and the after-tax PV-10, or standardized measure, is the discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows from our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. Our existing tax attributes, including net operating losses and remaining depreciable tax basis related to our natural gas and oil properties, more than offset our future net operating income, resulting in no tax effect to our PV-10 calculation for the year ended December 31, 2020.

(7)Includes future asset retirement obligations outside of Appalachia.

Lease Expirations

The following table summarizes the leasehold acreage expiring over the next three years, assuming successful wells are not drilled to develop the acreage and leases are not extended:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)We have no reported proved undeveloped locations expiring in 2021.

(2)The leasehold acreage expiring includes 8,907 acres acquired through the Montage Merger that are subject to annual extension options at our sole discretion. Excluding this acreage, of the remaining leasehold acreage expiring, 17,460 net acres in 2021, 6,173 net acres in 2022 and 5,573 net acres in 2023 can be extended for an average 4.9 years.

(3)Exploration licenses were extended through March 2021 but have been subject to a moratorium since 2015. We are currently working with Canadian officials to extend our licenses, although we cannot assure that the licenses will be extended past March 2021. We fully impaired our investment in New Brunswick in 2016.

We refer you to “Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures” in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves as well as our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. We also refer you to the risk factor “Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

Presented below is a summary of changes in our proved undeveloped reserves for 2019 and 2020:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Primarily due to changes associated with the analysis of updated data collected in the year and decreases related to current year production.

(2)Consists of reserves associated with planned wells that were PUD at the beginning of the year but were subsequently reclassified to unproved due to changes in the drilling plan, in accordance with the SEC five-year rule.

Performance, production and price revisions consist of revisions to reserves associated with wells having proved reserves in existence as of the beginning of the year. Extensions, discoveries and other additions include new reserves locations added in the current year.

•As of December 31, 2020, we had 3,787 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves, all of which we expect will be developed within five years of the initial disclosure as the starting reference date. During 2020, we invested $674 million in connection with converting 1,487 Bcfe, or 24%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2019 into proved developed reserves and added 474 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. As a result of the commodity price environment in 2020, we had downward price revisions of 3,288 Bcfe. These reductions were partially offset by a 567 Bcfe increase due to performance and production revisions.

•As of December 31, 2019, we had 6,300 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. During 2019, we invested $638 million in connection with converting 1,235 Bcfe, or 19%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2018 into proved developed reserves and added 1,004 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. As a result of the commodity price environment in 2019, we had downward price revisions of 407 Bcfe. In addition, we also had 109 Bcfe that was reclassified to unproven. These reductions were more than offset by a 683 Bcfe increase due to performance and production revisions. Certain planned wells that were proved undeveloped as of the beginning of 2019 were rescheduled beyond five years. Accordingly, the proved undeveloped reserves associated with these planned wells were removed in 2019 as they fell outside of the SEC mandated five-year development window. We expect these previous proved undeveloped reserves to be added back in future years.

Our December 31, 2020 proved reserves included 2,437 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves from 138 locations that have a positive present value on an undiscounted basis in compliance with proved reserve requirements but do not have a positive present value when discounted at 10%. These properties have a negative present value of $207 million when discounted at 10%. We have made a final investment decision and are committed to developing these reserves within five years from the date of initial booking.

Index to Financial Statements

We expect that the development costs for our proved undeveloped reserves of 3,787 Bcfe as of December 31, 2020 will require us to invest an additional $1.6 billion for those reserves to be brought to production. Our ability to make the necessary investments to generate these cash inflows is subject to factors that may be beyond our control. The commodity price environment over the past year has resulted, and could continue to result, in certain reserves no longer being economic to produce, leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flows. We refer you to the risk factors “Natural gas, oil and NGL prices greatly affect our revenues and thus profits, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets” and “Significant capital investment is required to replace our reserves and conduct our business” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks.

Our Reserve Replacement

The reserve replacement ratio measures the success of an E&P company in adding new reserves to replace the reserves that are being depleted by its current production volumes. The reserve replacement ratio, which we discuss below, is an important analytical measure used by investors and peers in the E&P industry to evaluate performance results and long-term prospects. There are limitations as to the usefulness of this measure, as it does not reflect the type of reserves or the cost of adding the reserves or indicate the potential value of the reserve additions. 

In 2020, we replaced 84% of our production volumes with 741 Bcfe of proved reserve additions, all of which were from Appalachia. The impact of the reserve decrease associated with price revisions was substantially offset by the positive performance and production revisions and reserves acquired in the Montage acquisition. The following table summarizes the changes in our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves for the year ended December 31, 2020:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Other includes properties outside of Appalachia.

Our ability to add reserves depends upon many factors that are beyond our control. We refer you to the risk factors “Significant capital investment is required to replace our reserves and conduct our business” and “If we are not able to replace reserves, our production levels and thus our revenues and profits may decline.” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report and to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks.

Our Operations

Northeast Appalachia

Northeast Appalachia represented 54% of our total 2020 net production and 41% of our total reserves as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, our reserves in Northeast Appalachia increased by 79 Bcf, which included net additions of 672 Bcf, acquisitions of 223 Bcf and net upward performance revisions of 46 Bcf, partially offset by net downward price revisions of 389 Bcf and production of 473 Bcf. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 217,296 net acres in Northeast Appalachia and had a total of 677 wells on production that we operated. Below is a summary of Northeast Appalachia’s operating results for the latest two years: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Our undeveloped acreage position as of December 31, 2020 had an average royalty interest of 15%.

(2)Excludes 587 and 516 wells as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in which we have only an overriding royalty interest.

(3)Excludes 27 and 3 wells as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in which we have only an overriding royalty interest.

For 2020 as compared to 2019:

•Our average completed well cost per foot decreased primarily due to increased lateral lengths and operational execution.

Our ability to bring our Northeast Appalachia production to market depends on a number of factors including the construction of and/or the availability of capacity on gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. We refer you to “Marketing” in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of our gathering and transportation arrangements for Northeast Appalachia production.

Southwest Appalachia

Southwest Appalachia represented 46% of our total 2020 net production and 59% of our total reserves as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, our reserves in Southwest Appalachia decreased by 810 Bcfe, as net downward price revisions of 3,981 Bcfe and production of 407 Bcfe were only partially offset by acquisitions of 2,131 Bcfe, net upward performance revisions of 1,378 Bcfe and net additions of 69 Bcfe. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 571,922 net acres in Southwest Appalachia and had a total of 1,670 wells on production that we operated. Below is a summary of Southwest Appalachia’s operating results for the latest two years:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Our undeveloped acreage position as of December 31, 2020 had an average royalty interest of 15%.

(2)Approximately 405 Bcfe and 317 Bcfe for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were produced from the Marcellus Shale formation.

(3)Excludes 99 and 5 wells as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in which we have only an overriding royalty interest.

(4)Excludes 27 wells as of December 31, 2020 in which we have only an overriding royalty interest.

(5)Excludes $9 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to our water infrastructure project.

(6)Average completed well cost and average lateral length for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include both Marcellus wells and Upper Devonian wells.

For 2020 as compared to 2019:

•Our average completed well cost per foot decreased primarily due to increased lateral lengths, operational execution and savings from vertical integration.

Other

Excluding 2,518,519 acres in New Brunswick, Canada, which have been subject to a government-imposed drilling moratorium since 2015, we held 9,764 net undeveloped acres for the potential development of new resources as of December 31, 2020 in areas outside of Appalachia. This compares to 27,334 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2019, excluding the New Brunswick acreage.

We limited our activities in areas beyond our assets in Appalachia during 2020 and 2019 as a result of the commodity price environment as we focused our capital allocation on these more economically competitive plays. There can be no assurance that any prospects outside of our development plays will result in viable projects or that we will not abandon our initial investments. 

New Brunswick, Canada. We currently hold exclusive licenses to search and conduct an exploration program covering 2,518,519 net acres in New Brunswick. In 2015, the provincial government in New Brunswick imposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing until it is satisfied with a list of conditions. In response to this moratorium, we requested and were granted an extension of its licenses to March 2021. In May 2016, the provincial government announced that the moratorium would continue indefinitely. Given this development, we fully impaired our investment in New Brunswick in 2016. We are currently working with Canadian officials to extend our licenses, although we cannot assure that the licenses will be extended past March 2021. Unless and until the moratorium is lifted, we will not be able to develop these assets.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

In November 2020, we completed a merger with Montage Resources Corporation (the “Merger”) pursuant to which Montage merged with and into Southwestern, with Southwestern continuing as the surviving company. At the effective time of the Merger we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock in Montage in exchange for 1.8656 shares of our common stock per share of Montage common stock. The Merger expanded our footprint in Appalachia by supplementing our Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia operations and by expanding our operations into Ohio. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report for more information on the Merger.

During 2019, we sold non-core acreage for $38 million. There was no production or proved reserves associated with this acreage.

Capital Investments

(1)Includes $9 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 related to our water infrastructure project.

•The decrease in 2020 E&P capital investing, as compared to the prior year, resulted from reduced average well costs as well as our commitment to invest within our cash flows from operations, which are heavily dependent on commodity prices, supplemented by the remaining proceeds from the Fayetteville Shale sale.

•In 2020, we drilled 98 wells (86 of which were spud in 2020), completed 96 wells, placed 100 wells to sales and had 42 wells in progress at year-end. 

•Of the 42 wells in progress at year-end, 26 and 16 were located in Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia, respectively.

We refer you to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Investing” within Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for additional discussion of the factors that could impact our planned capital investments in 2021.

Sales. The following tables present historical information about our production volumes for natural gas, oil and NGLs and our average realized natural gas, oil and NGL sales prices:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The increase in production in 2020 resulted primarily from a 88 Bcfe increase in net production in Southwest Appalachia and a 14 Bcf increase in production in Northeast Appalachia. These increases included 28 Bcfe in production from our acreage newly acquired through the Merger.

Sales of natural gas, oil and NGL production are conducted under contracts that reflect current prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for these commodities, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand for our production. We regularly enter into various derivative and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected production to support certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. We limit derivative agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings, and our policies prohibit speculation.

As of December 31, 2020, we had the following commodity price derivatives in place on our targeted future production:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of February 25, 2021, we had the following commodity price derivatives in place on our targeted 2020 and future production:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We intend to use derivatives to limit the impact of price volatility on a large portion of expected future production volumes to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow. We refer you to Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” for further information regarding our derivatives and risk management as of December 31, 2020.

During 2020, the average price we received for our natural gas production, excluding the impact of derivatives and including the cost of transportation, was approximately $0.74 per Mcf lower than average New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, prices. Differences between NYMEX and price realized (basis differentials) are due primarily to locational differences and transportation cost. 

As of December 31, 2020, we have entered into physical sales arrangements to limit the impact of basis volatility on approximately 217 Bcf and 65 Bcf of our 2021 and 2022 expected natural gas production, respectively, at a basis differential to NYMEX natural gas price of approximately ($0.24) per MMBtu and ($0.35) per MMBtu for 2021 and 2022, respectively.

We have also entered into financial basis swaps for approximately 219 Bcf, 139 Bcf, 47 Bcf, 11 Bcf and 4 Bcf of our 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 expected natural gas production, respectively, at a basis differential to NYMEX natural gas price of approximately ($0.21) per MMBtu, ($0.33) per MMBtu, ($0.45) per MMBtu, ($0.60) per MMBtu and ($0.59) per MMBtu for 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.

We refer you to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities.

Delivery Commitments. As of December 31, 2020, we had natural gas delivery commitments of 486 Bcf in 2021 and 113 Bcf in 2022 under existing agreements. These amounts are well below our expected 2021 natural gas production from Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia and expected 2022 production from our available reserves, which are not subject to any priorities or curtailments that may affect quantities delivered to our customers or any priority allocations or price limitations imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond our control that may affect our ability to meet our delivery commitments other than those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of Part I of this Annual Report. We expect to be able to fulfill all of our short-term and long-term delivery commitments to provide natural gas from our own production of available reserves; however, if we are unable to do so, we may have to purchase natural gas at market to fulfill our obligations.

Customers. Our E&P production is marketed primarily by our Marketing segment. Our customers include major energy companies, utilities and industrial purchasers of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2020, one purchaser accounted for 10% of our revenues. A default on this account could have a material impact on the Company, but we do not believe that there is a material risk of default. No other purchasers accounted for greater than 10% of consolidated revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, no single third-party purchaser accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. We believe that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our natural gas, oil and NGL production.

Competition

All phases of the natural gas and oil industry are highly competitive. We compete in the acquisition and disposition of properties, the search for and development of reserves, the production and marketing of natural gas, oil and NGLs, and the securing of labor, services and equipment required to conduct our operations. Our competitors include major oil and natural gas companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources that substantially exceed those available to us. Consequently, we will encounter competition that may affect both the price we receive and contract terms we must offer. We also face competition in accessing pipeline and other services to transport our product to market. Likewise, there are substitutes for the commodities we produce, such as other fuels for power generation, heating and transportation, and those markets in effect compete with us.

We cannot predict whether and to what extent any regulatory changes initiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, or any other new energy legislation or regulations will achieve the goal of increasing competition, lessening preferential treatment and enhancing transparency in markets in which our natural gas production is sold. Similarly, we cannot predict whether legal constraints that have hindered the development of new transportation infrastructure, particularly in the northeastern United States, will continue. However, we do not believe that we will be disproportionately affected as compared to other natural gas and oil producers and marketers by any action taken by the FERC or any other legislative or regulatory body or the status of the development of transportation facilities.

Regulation

Producing natural gas, oil and NGL resources and transporting and selling production historically have been heavily regulated. For example, state governments regulate the location of wells and establish the minimum size for spacing units. Permits typically are required before drilling. State and local government zoning and land use regulations may also limit the locations for drilling and production. Similar regulations can also affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market. In addition, various suppliers of goods and services may require licensing.

Currently in the United States, the price at which natural gas, oil or NGLs may be sold is not regulated. Congress has imposed price regulation from time to time, and there can be no assurance that the current, less stringent regulatory approach will continue. In 2015, the federal government repealed a 40-year ban on the export of crude oil. The export of natural gas continues to require federal permits. Broader freedom to export could lead to higher prices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and the rules that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, (the “CFTC”), the SEC, and certain other regulators have issued thereunder regulate certain swaps, futures and options contracts in the major energy markets, including for natural gas, oil and NGLs

Producing and transporting natural gas, oil and NGLs is also subject to extensive environmental regulation. We refer you to “Other – Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report and the risk factor “We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.

Marketing

We engage in marketing activities which primarily support our E&P operations and generate revenue through the marketing of natural gas, oil and NGLs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Operating loss decreased $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to a $2 million decrease in operating costs and expenses. In addition, marketing operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a $3 million impairment of non-core gathering assets, a $2 million loss on the sale of operating assets and $1 million in gas storage gains recorded in other operating revenues.

•Marketing revenues decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily as a 27% decrease in the price received for volumes marketed more than offset a 37 Bcfe increase in marketed volumes.

•Cash flow from operations of $317 million generated by our Marketing segment decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, as a $706 million decrease in cash operating costs and expenses was offset by a $705 million decrease in operating revenues and a $441 million decrease primarily related to timing differences of payables and receivables between the respective periods.

Marketing

We attempt to capture opportunities related to the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs primarily involving the marketing of our own equity production and that of royalty owners in our wells. Additionally, we manage portfolio and locational, or basis, risk, acquire transportation rights on third-party pipelines and, in limited circumstances, purchase third-party natural gas to fulfill commitments specific to a geographic location.

Northeast Appalachia. Our transportation portfolio in Northeast Appalachia is highly diversified and allows us to access premium city-gate markets as well as to deliver natural gas from the Appalachian basin area to the southeast United States. The capacity agreements contain multiple extension and reduction options that allow us to right-size our transportation portfolio as needed for our production or to capture future market opportunities. The table below details our firm transportation, firm sales and total takeaway capacity over the next three years as of February 25, 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)We have extension options and potential contract renewal capacity of 332,000 MMBtu per day for 2022 and 559,000 MMBtu per day for 2023 for Northeast Appalachia.

Southwest Appalachia. Our transportation portfolio for all products in Southwest Appalachia, including commitments acquired through the Montage Merger, allows us to capitalize on strengthening markets and provides a path for production growth. Agreements with ET Rover Pipeline LLC and Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc.’s Mountaineer Xpress and Gulf Xpress pipelines allow us to access high-demand markets along the Gulf Coast while also capturing materially improving in-basin pricing, and our agreements with Rockies Express Pipeline LLC provide access to premium Midwest markets. In addition to our natural gas transportation, we have ethane take-away capacity that provides direct access to Mont Belvieu pricing. The table

below details our natural gas firm transportation, firm sales and total takeaway capacity over the next three years as of February 25, 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)We have extension options and potential contract renewal capacity of 76,900 MMBtu per day for 2022 and 76,900 MMBtu per day for 2023 for Southwest Appalachia.

Demand Charges

As of December 31, 2020, our obligations for demand and similar charges under the firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements totaled approximately $8.5 billion, $531 million of which related to access capacity on future pipeline and gathering infrastructure projects that still require the granting of regulatory approvals and additional construction efforts. We also have guarantee obligations of up to $923 million of that amount. In February 2020, we were notified that the proposed Constitution pipeline project was cancelled and that we were released from a firm transportation agreement with its sponsor.

In the first quarter of 2019, we agreed to purchase firm transportation with pipelines in Appalachia starting in 2021 and running through 2032 totaling $357 million in total contractual commitments, of which the seller has agreed to reimburse us for $133 million.

We refer you to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further details on our demand charges and the risk factor “We have made significant investments in oilfield services businesses, including our drilling rigs, water infrastructure and pressure pumping equipment, to lower costs and secure inputs for our operations and transportation for our production. If our development and production activities are curtailed or disrupted, we may not recover our investment in these activities, which could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely impact our relationships with third-party providers” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.

Competition

Our marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services, many of which possess larger financial and other resources than we have. Some of these competitors are other producers and affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to end users. Other factors affecting competition are the cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand and the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities. We believe that our ability to compete effectively within the marketing segment in the future depends upon establishing and maintaining strong relationships with customers.

Customers

Our marketing customers include major energy companies, utilities and industrial purchasers of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2020, one purchaser accounted for 10% of our revenues. A default could have a material impact on the Company, but we do not believe that there is a material risk of default. No other purchasers accounted for greater than 10% of consolidated revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, no single third-party purchaser accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. We believe that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our natural gas, oil and NGL production.

Regulation

The transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs is heavily regulated. FERC regulates the rates and the terms and conditions of transportation service provided by interstate natural gas, crude oil and NGL pipelines. State governments typically must authorize the construction of pipelines for intrastate service. Moreover, the rates charged for intrastate transportation by pipeline are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Currently, all pipelines we own are intrastate and immaterial to our operations.

State and local permitting, zoning and land use regulations can affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market, and the lack of new pipeline capacity can limit our ability to reach relevant markets for the sale of the commodities we produce.

The transportation of natural gas and oil is also subject to extensive environmental regulation. We refer you to “Other – Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report and the risk factor “We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.

Other

We currently have no significant business activity outside of our E&P and Marketing segments.

Environmental Regulation

General. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations require permits for drilling wells and the maintenance of bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and also regulate the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters. We maintain insurance for clean-up costs in limited instances arising out of sudden and accidental events, but otherwise we may not be fully insured against all such risks. Although future environmental obligations are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that future developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws or enforcement thereof, will not cause us to incur material environmental liabilities or costs.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and the imposition of injunctive relief. Certain laws and legal principles can make us liable for environmental damage to properties we previously owned, and although we generally require purchasers to assume that liability, there is no assurance that they will have sufficient funds should a liability arise. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes may result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transportation, disposal or cleanup requirements. We do not expect continued compliance with existing requirements to have a material adverse impact on us, but there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future. We refer you to “Other – Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report and the risk factor “We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject.

Generation and Disposal of Wastes.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the “Superfund law,” imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of a site where the release occurred, as well as persons that transported or disposed, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and production of natural gas and oil. RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil, natural gas or geothermal energy.” However, legislative and regulatory initiatives have been considered from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. If such measures were to be enacted, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste.

The Clean Water Act, as amended, or CWA, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into regulated waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. The CWA and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges 

20

Table of Contents  

Index to Financial Statements

of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. The EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans.

The Oil Pollution Act, as amended, or OPA, and regulations promulgated thereunder impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills into regulated waters. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. Although oil accounted for only 4% of our total production in 2020 and 2019 and 2% in 2018, we expect this percentage to increase as we continue to develop our Southwest Appalachia assets.

We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated with the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us and/or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control. Under CERCLA, the CWA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial plugging or closure operations to prevent future contamination.

Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act, as amended, restricts emissions into the atmosphere. Various activities we conduct as part of our operations, such as drilling, pumping and the use of vehicles, can result in emissions to the environment. We must obtain permits, typically from local authorities, to conduct various regulated activities. Federal and state governmental agencies are looking into the issues associated with methane and other emissions from oil and natural gas activities, and further regulation could increase our costs or restrict our ability to produce. Although methane emissions are not currently regulated at the federal level, we are required to report emissions of various greenhouse gases, including methane.

Threatened and Endangered Species. The Endangered Species Act and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction. Protection of threatened and endangered species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining drilling and other permits and may include restrictions on road building and other activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats. Based on the species that have been identified to date, we do not believe there are any species protected under the Endangered Species Act that would materially and adversely affect our operations at this time.

Hydraulic Fracturing. We utilize hydraulic fracturing in drilling wells as a means of maximizing their productivity. It is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids from dense and deep rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.

In the past several years, there has been an increased focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, both in the United States and abroad. In the United States, hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but federal agencies have started to assert regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, issued final rules effective as of October 15, 2012 that subject oil and gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAP programs. In May 2016, the EPA finalized additional regulations to control methane and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from certain oil and gas equipment and operations. In September 2018, the EPA issued proposed revisions to those regulations, which would reduce certain obligations thereunder. In September 2020, the EPA finalized further amendments to the standards that removed the transmission and storage segments from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. Several lawsuits were filed challenging these amendments, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered an administrative stay of these amendments shortly after they were finalized. Although the administrative stay was lifted in October 2020, which brought the amendments into effect, the amendments may be subject to reversal under a new presidential administration. As a result, we cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to 

21

Table of Contents  

Index to Financial Statements

comply with such requirements. The EPA also finalized pretreatment standards that would prohibit the indirect discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works. Based on our current operations and practices, management believes such newly promulgated rules will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view may change in the future.

In addition, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. A number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead federal and state governments and agencies to develop and implement additional regulations.

Although the prior administration relaxed many regulations adopted in the latter part of the prior administration, that trend is likely to reverse under the new administration. In January 2021, the new administration announced a 60-day suspension of new oil and gas leasing and drilling permits on federal lands, and subsequently signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. In addition, some states in which we operate have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, waste disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling and/or completion of wells.

Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process has led to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids including from the development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, various officials and candidates at the federal, state and local levels, including some presidential candidates, have proposed banning hydraulic fracturing altogether. We refer you to the risk factor “We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.

In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for seismic activity to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in others. We utilize third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations. These third parties may operate injection wells and may be subject to regulatory restrictions relating to seismicity. 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions. In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established on a case-by case basis. One of our subsidiaries operates compressor stations, which are facilities that are required to adhere to the PSD or Title V permit requirements. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.

22

Table of Contents  

Index to Financial Statements

The EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. Although Congress from time to time has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time.

The adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions or install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At the same time, new laws and regulations are prompting power producers to shift from coal to natural gas, which is increasing demand.

Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (the “Paris Agreement”). The Paris Agreement entered into effect in November 2016 after more than 70 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement. In November 2019, the United States initiated the year-long process of formally withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, which resulted in an effective exit date of November 2020. However, in January 2021, the new administration announced that the U.S. would be rejoining the Paris Agreement. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business.

Employee Health and Safety. Our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.

Canada. Our activities in Canada have, to date, been limited to certain geological and geophysical activities and now are subject to a moratorium. If and when the moratorium ends and should we begin drilling and development activities in New Brunswick, we will be subject to federal, provincial and local environmental regulations.

Human Capital

We aim to provide a safe, healthy, respectful and fair workplace for all employees. We focus our actions to ensure our people are engaged and have the necessary tools and skills to be highly successful. 

Southwestern Energy is committed to respect in the workplace. All employees participate in a program addressing workplace behavior and respect on an annual basis. Our Human Rights Policy, which is consistent with the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, underscores our commitment to our workforce and extends to vendors and contractors. All decisions regarding recruiting, hiring, training, evaluation, assignment, advancement and termination of employment are made without unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, age, pregnancy, disability, present military status or veteran status, genetic information, marital status or any other factor that the law protects from employment discrimination. Compensation is based on several primary factors, including performance, skills, years of experience, time in position and market data. Through our SWomeN initiatives, we actively seek to retain and develop our female talent.

Southwestern Energy leaders, including senior management, are evaluated on and held accountable for the health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) performance of their teams. We include HSE considerations in every business decision we make and foster a true “ONE Team” culture, where our employees and contractors work together to uphold the same high safety standards.

Our response to COVID-19 in 2020 was driven by our long-standing commitment to safety. We formed a cross-functional Incident Response Team (“IRT”) on March 12, 2020 to manage and oversee prolonged company-wide response and mitigation efforts. The IRT met daily and provided real-time and weekly reports to senior management. Increased safeguards for employees

and contractors were put in place, including mask requirements, social distancing, isolation and quarantine procedures, dynamic office closures and remote work protocols, rapid cleaning response protocols, temperature screenings at office locations, COVID-19 questionnaires and modified protocols as necessary based on continuous monitoring of relevant data and guidance. We have also provided additional benefits to our employees including COVID-19 testing for all office and field employees and their families, paid time off for non-exempt workers required to isolate or quarantine, and have made plans to make the COVID-19 vaccine available to employees and their families who want it. 

Additional information about our commitment to human capital is available on our website and in other company filings available on our website. Note that the information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this filing.

As of December 31, 2020, we had 900 total employees, a decrease of 2% compared to year-end 2019. None of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement at year-end 2020. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
