ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

The risk factors noted in this section, and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report, describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. 

RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS 

Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could affect our ability to collect rents and late fees from tenants, and our ability to evict tenants, in addition to having other negative effects on our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions, local, regional, national, or international health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could negatively impact our tenants and our operations. For example, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global

economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting a wide variety of measures including states of emergency, mandatory quarantines, required business and school closures, implementing “shelter in place” orders, and restricting travel. In addition, many cities and states have enacted, or are considering enacting, exceptions to contractual obligations for residents and commercial tenants, including government mandated rent delays or other abatement measures or concessions or prohibitions on lease terminations or evictions. Many experts predict that the outbreak will trigger a period of material global economic slowdown or a global recession. 

Factors that have negatively impacted, or would negatively impact, our operations or those of entities in which we hold a partial interest during the COVID-19 pandemic or another health crisis, adverse economic or geopolitical event or dislocation in the credit market include: 

•  

our ability to collect rents and late fees on a timely basis or at all, without reductions or other concessions; 

•  

our ability to evict residents for non-payment and for other reasons; 

•  

our ability to ensure business continuity in the event our continuity of operations plan is not effective or improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption; 

•  

fluctuations in regional and local economies, local real estate conditions, and rental rates; 

•  

our ability to control incremental costs associated with COVID-19; 

•  

our ability to dispose of communities at all or on terms favorable to us; 

•  

our ability to complete developments and redevelopments and other construction projects as planned; and 

•  

potential litigation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict how significant the impact of this outbreak will be on the global economy, our residents and commercial tenants, our communities, and the operations of entities in which we hold a noncontrolling interest (including our interest in Maximus PM Mezzanine A LLC, the partnership owning the “Parkmerced Apartments”), or for how long disruptions are likely to continue. The extent of such impact will depend on developments, which are highly uncertain, rapidly evolving and cannot be predicted, including the ability to contain the virus, the duration of measures implemented, and the overall impact of these measures. Such developments, depending on their nature, duration, and intensity, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below. 

We do not have control over the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments, the operation of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our indirect interest in the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments is subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, exposure to the skill and capital of the controlling party and those resulting from the severe downturn in San Francisco rents, the ongoing disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated governmental response, and the current economic situation which may result in all or a portion of the loan not being repaid. Such risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Development, redevelopment, and construction risks could affect our profitability. 

Development and redevelopment are subject to numerous risks, including the following: 

•  

we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third-party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities; 

•  

we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material, labor, or other factors and costs, such as litigation and program changes; 

•  

we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of an apartment community on schedule, resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues; 

•  

occupancy rates and rents at an apartment community may fail to meet our expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development of competing communities; 

5 

Table of Contents 

•  

we may be unable to obtain financing, including construction loans, with favorable terms, or at all, which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity; 

•  

we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore, or stop projects we have already commenced, for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs, and, as a result, we may fail to recover costs already incurred in exploring those opportunities; 

•  

we are required to pay rent to AIR on the Initial Leased Properties as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement with AIR (and any additional properties we may lease from them in accordance with the Master Leasing Agreement), regardless of whether our developments or redevelopments are successful; 

•  

we have the right to terminate our leases with AIR and may receive payment from AIR, but the price AIR generally has the option to pay in such event under the Master Leasing Agreement may be less than what a third party would have been willing to pay us if we sold such property to a third party; 

•  

we may incur liabilities to third parties during the development or redevelopment process and we may be faced with claims for construction defects after a property has been developed; 

•  

we may face opposition from local community or political groups with respect to the development, construction, or operations at a particular site; 

•  

health and safety incidents or other accidents on site may occur during development; 

•  

unexpected events or circumstances may arise during the development or redevelopment process that affect the timing of completion and the cost and profitability of the development or redevelopment; and 

•  

loss of a key member of a redevelopment or development team could adversely affect our ability to deliver developments and redevelopments on time and within our budget. 

Some of these development risks may be heightened given current uncertain and potentially volatile market conditions. If market volatility causes economic conditions to remain unpredictable or to trend downwards, we may not achieve our expected returns on properties under development and we could lose some or all of our investments in those properties. In addition, the lead time required to develop, construct, and lease-up a development property may increase, which could adversely impact our projected returns or result in a termination of the development project. 

In addition, we may serve as either the construction manager or the general contractor for our development projects. The construction of real estate projects entails unique risks, including risks that the project will fail to conform to building plans, specifications, and timetables. These failures could be caused by labor strikes, weather, government regulations, and other conditions beyond our control. In addition, we may become liable for injuries and accidents occurring during the construction process that are underinsured. 

Failure to generate sufficient net operating income may adversely affect our liquidity, limit our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures, or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions. 

Our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures on our communities depends on, among other things, our ability to generate net operating income in excess of required debt payments and our ability to collect on interest and principal payments due to us pursuant to the terms of our arrangement with AIR relative to their interest in the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures on our communities, we may not be able to preserve the competitiveness of our communities, which could adversely affect their net operating income and long-term value. 

Our ability to make payments to our investors depends on our ability to generate net operating income in excess of required debt payments and capital expenditure requirements and our ability to collect on interest and principal payments due to us pursuant to the terms of our arrangement with AIR relative to their interest in the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments. Our net operating income and liquidity may be adversely affected by events or conditions beyond our control, including: 

•  

the general economic climate; 

•  

an inflationary environment in which the costs to operate and maintain our communities increase at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents, which we can only do upon renewal of existing leases or at the inception of new leases; 

•  

competition from other apartment communities and other housing options; 

•  

local conditions, such as loss of jobs, unemployment rates, or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates; 

•  

changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; 

6 

Table of Contents 

•  

changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; and 

•  

changes in interest rates and the availability of financing. 

We will initially be primarily dependent on AIR for our pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities. 

We will initially be primarily dependent on the pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities that may be sourced by AIR for a significant portion of our anticipated growth and future revenue. Until we acquire additional sources of development and redevelopment opportunities, we will primarily depend on AIR. We may not be successful in identifying additional opportunities to further diversify and increase our sources of revenue and reduce our portfolio concentration in the near future or at all. The inability of AIR to source such opportunities for us efficiently or at all, could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Our properties are geographically concentrated in California, Chicago, Florida, and in the Northeast region of the United States, which makes us more susceptible to regional and local adverse economic and other conditions than if we owned a more geographically diversified portfolio. 

The majority of our properties are located in California, Chicago, Florida, and in the Northeast region of the United States. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse economic or other conditions in these markets (such as periods of economic slowdown or recession, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, increases in real estate and other taxes, and the cost of complying with governmental regulations or increased regulation), as well as to natural disasters (including earthquakes, storms, and hurricanes), potentially adverse effects of “global warming,” and other disruptions that occur in these markets (such as terrorist activity or threats of terrorist activity and other events), any of which may have a greater impact on the value of our assets or on our operating results than if we owned a more geographically diversified portfolio. 

We cannot assure you that these markets will grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will be favorable to owners, operators, and developers of office, multifamily or retail assets, or future development assets. Our operations may also be affected if competing assets are built in these markets. Moreover, submarkets within our core markets may be dependent upon a limited number of industries. Any adverse economic or other conditions in the Northeast region of the United States or in California, or any decrease in demand for office, multifamily, or retail assets could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our development projects may subject us to certain liabilities, and we are subject to risks associated with developing properties in partnership with others. 

We may hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction, engineering, and various other services for development projects. Certain of these contracts may be structured such that we are the principal rather than the agent. As a result, we may assume liabilities in the course of the project and be subjected to, or become liable for, claims for construction defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions by third parties we have engaged. 

Adverse outcomes of disputes or litigation could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, particularly if we have not limited the extent of the damages for which we may be liable, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance that we carry. Moreover, our tenants may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a legal matter, in which case we may determine it necessary to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the tenant or customer relationship or to protect our corporate brand. Acting as a principal may also mean that we pay a contractor before we have been reimbursed by our tenants. This exposes us to additional risks of collection in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, or a condominium purchaser default. The reverse can occur as well, where a contractor we have paid files for bankruptcy protection or commits fraud with the funds before completing a project that we have funded in part or in full. 

Additionally, we may use partnerships and limited liability companies to develop some of our real estate investments. Acting through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we typically will be the general partner or managing member in these partnerships or limited liability companies. There are, however, instances in which we may not control or even participate in management or day-to-day operations of these properties. The use of partnerships and limited liability companies involve special risks associated with the possibility that: 

•  

a partner or member may have interests or goals inconsistent with ours; 

•  

a general partner or managing member may take actions contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives with respect to our real estate investments; 

•  

a partner or member could experience financial difficulties that prevent it from fulfilling its financial or other responsibilities to the project; or 

7 

Table of Contents 

•  

a partner may not fulfill its contractual obligations. 

In the event any of our partners or members file for bankruptcy, we could be precluded from taking certain actions affecting our project without bankruptcy court approval, which could diminish our control over the project even if we were the general partner or managing member. In addition, if the bankruptcy court were to discharge the obligations of our partner or member, it could result in our ultimate liability for the project being greater than originally anticipated. 

Further, disputes between us and a partner may result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent our management from focusing their time and attention on our business. 

To the extent we are a general partner, we may be exposed to unlimited liability, which may exceed our investment or equity in the partnership. If one of our subsidiaries is a general partner of a particular partnership, it may be exposed to the same kind of unlimited liability. 

Development of properties may entail a lengthy, uncertain, and costly entitlement process. 

Approval to develop real property sometimes requires political support and generally entails an extensive entitlement process involving multiple and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requires discretionary action by local governments. Real estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. We may incur substantial costs to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. An increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs, or in some cases cause us to determine that the property is not feasible for development. In addition, our competitors and local residents may challenge our efforts to obtain entitlements and permits for the development of properties. The process to comply with these regulations is usually lengthy and costly, may not result in the approvals we seek, and can be expected to materially affect our development activities. 

Government regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of the development of our communities, increase our expenses or limit our building of apartments or other activities. 

Various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, sales, and similar matters apply to or affect the real estate development industry. In addition, our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained depends on factors beyond our control, such as changes in federal, state, and local policies, rules and regulations, and their interpretations and application. 

Municipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. If municipalities in which we operate take such actions, it could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays, increasing our costs, or limiting our ability to operate in those municipalities. These measures may reduce our ability to develop apartment communities and to build and sell other real estate development projects in the affected markets, including with respect to land we may already own, and create additional costs and administration requirements, which in turn may harm our future sales, margins, and earnings. 

In addition, there is a variety of legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment, at the federal, state, and local level relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct buildings. Such environmental laws may affect, for example, how we manage storm water runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. In addition, it is possible that some form of expanded energy efficiency legislation may be passed by the U.S. Congress or federal agencies and certain state legislatures, which may, despite being phased in over time, significantly increase our costs of building apartment communities and the sale price to our buyers and adversely affect our sales volumes. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law. 

Energy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and, because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy-related taxes and regulations. Our noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocations, and other sanctions. 

Governmental regulation affects not only construction activities but also sales activities, mortgage lending activities, and other dealings with consumers. Further, government agencies routinely initiate audits, reviews, or investigations of our business

practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties. 

Competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes, increase or maintain rents or execute our development strategy. 

Our apartment communities compete for residents with other housing alternatives, including other rental apartments and condominiums, and, to a lesser degree, single-family homes that are available for rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Competitive residential housing, as well as household formation and job creation in a particular area, could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates. 

In addition, there are many developers, managers, and owners of apartment real estate and underdeveloped land, as well as REITs, private real estate companies, and investors, that compete with us, some of whom have greater financial resources and market share than us. If our competitors prevent us from realizing our real estate development objectives, our performance may fall short of our expectations and adversely affect our business.

Table of Contents 

Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to sell apartment communities or other assets when appropriate. 

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. REIT tax rules also restrict our ability to sell apartment communities. Thus, we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other market conditions. Our ability to dispose of apartment communities in the future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions, including the cost and availability of financing. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Potential liability or other expenditures associated with potential environmental contamination may be costly. 

Various federal, state, and local laws subject real estate owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present in the land or buildings. Potentially hazardous materials may include polychlorinated biphenyls, petroleum-based fuels, lead-based paint, or asbestos, among other materials. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such materials. The presence of, or the failure to manage or remediate properly, these materials may adversely affect occupancy at such real estate as well as the ability to sell or finance such real estate. In addition, governmental agencies may bring claims for costs associated with investigation and remediation actions, damages to natural resources, and for potential fines or penalties in connection with such damage or with respect to the improper management of hazardous materials. Moreover, private plaintiffs may potentially make claims for investigation and remediation costs they incur, or personal injury, disease, disability, or other infirmities related to the alleged presence of hazardous materials at an apartment community. In addition to potential environmental liabilities or costs associated with our current real estate, we may also be responsible for such liabilities or costs associated with communities we acquire or manage in the future, or real estate we no longer own or operate.  

Rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability. 

State and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates, which may affect our rental income. Especially in times of recession and economic slowdown, rent control initiatives can acquire significant political support. If rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties, our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected. 

Laws benefiting disabled persons may result in our incurrence of unanticipated expenses. 

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), all places intended to be used by the public are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (“FHAA”), requires apartment communities first occupied after March 13, 1991, to comply with design and construction requirements for disabled access. For those apartment communities receiving federal funds, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 also has requirements regarding disabled access. These and federal, state, and local laws may require structural modifications to our apartment communities or changes in policy/practice, or affect renovations of the communities. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. Although we believe that our apartment communities are substantially in compliance with present requirements, we may incur unanticipated expenses to comply with the ADA, the FHAA, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in connection with the ongoing operation or redevelopment of our apartment communities. 

Moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly. 

Although we are proactively engaged in managing moisture intrusion and preventing the presence of mold at our apartment communities, it is not unusual for periodic moisture intrusion to cause mold in isolated locations within an apartment community. We have implemented policies, procedures, and training, and include a detailed moisture intrusion and mold assessment during acquisition due diligence. We believe these measures will manage mold exposure at our apartment communities and will minimize the effects that mold may have on our residents. To date, we have not incurred any material costs or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abate mold conditions. We have only limited insurance coverage for property damage claims arising from the presence of mold and for personal injury claims related to mold exposure. 

Although we are insured for certain risks, the cost of insurance, increased claims activity, or losses resulting from casualty events may affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

We are insured for a portion of our real estate assets’ exposure to casualty losses resulting from fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, and other perils, which insurance is subject to deductibles and self-insurance retention. We recognize casualty losses or gains based on the net book value of the affected asset and the amount of any related insurance proceeds. In many instances, the actual cost to repair or replace the apartment community may exceed its net book value and any insurance proceeds. We recognize the uninsured portion of losses as casualty losses in the periods in which they are incurred. In addition, we are self-insured for a portion of our exposure to third-party claims related to our employee health insurance plans, workers’ compensation coverage, and general liability exposure. With respect to our exposure to claims of third parties, we establish reserves at levels that reflect our known and estimated losses. The ultimate cost of losses and the impact of unforeseen events  

10 

Table of Contents 

may vary materially from recorded reserves, and variances may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We purchase insurance to reduce our exposure to losses and limit our financial losses on large individual risks. The availability and cost of insurance are determined by market conditions outside our control. No assurance can be made that we will be able to obtain and maintain insurance at the same levels and on the same terms as we do today. If we are not able to obtain or maintain insurance in amounts, we consider appropriate for our business, or if the cost of obtaining such insurance increases materially, we may have to retain a larger portion of the potential loss associated with our exposures to risks. 

Natural disasters and severe weather may affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather such as hurricanes may result in significant damage to our real estate assets. The extent of our casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area. When we have geographic concentration of exposures, a single catastrophe (such as an earthquake) or destructive weather event (such as a hurricane) affecting a region may have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot accurately predict natural disasters or severe weather, or the number and type of such events that will affect us. As a result, our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next. Although we anticipate and plan for losses, there can be no assurance that our financial results will not be adversely affected by our exposure to losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather in the future that exceed our previous experience and assumptions. 

We depend on our senior management. 

Our success and our ability to implement and manage anticipated future growth depend, in large part, upon the efforts of our senior management team, who have extensive market knowledge and relationships, and exercise substantial influence over our operational, financing, acquisition, and disposition activity. Members of our senior management team have national or regional industry reputations that attract business and investment opportunities and assist us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants, and other industry participants. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, or our inability to attract and retain similarly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities, and weaken our relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants, and industry participants, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. 

We rely on AIR to manage a majority of our properties. If AIR fails to efficiently manage such properties, tenants may not renew their leases, or we may become subject to unforeseen liabilities. 

A majority of our properties are managed by AIR. We do not supervise AIR or its managers and employees on a day-to-day basis and we cannot assure you that they will manage such properties in a manner that is consistent with their obligations under our agreements, that they will not be negligent in their performance or engage in any criminal or fraudulent activity, or that they will not otherwise default on their management obligations to us. If any of the foregoing occurs, the relationships with our tenants at such properties could be damaged, which may cause the tenants not to renew their leases, and we could incur liabilities resulting from loss or injury to the properties or to persons at the properties. If we are unable to lease the properties or we become subject to significant liabilities as a result of AIR’s management performance, our financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed. 

In addition to property management services, we depend on AIR to support certain of our property’s operations, and any adverse changes in the financial health of AIR or our relationship with it could hinder AIR’s ability to successfully manage our operations. 

We are dependent on AIR to support certain of our property’s operations pursuant to the Property Management Agreement. Any adverse changes in the financial condition of AIR, AIR’s ability to retain or replace its employees, or our relationship with AIR, could hinder AIR’s ability to successfully manage our operations, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our business and operations would suffer in the event of significant disruptions or cyberattacks of our information technology systems or our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations related to privacy and data protection. 

Information technology, communication networks, and related systems are essential to the operation of our business. We use these systems to manage our vendor relationships, internal communications, accounting and record-keeping systems, and many other key aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks, which also depend on the strength of our procedures and the effectiveness of our internal controls. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks. 

Despite system redundancy, risk transfer, insurance, indemnification, the implementation of security measures, required employee awareness training, and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems, and systems maintained by third-party vendors with which we do business are vulnerable to damage from any number  

11 

Table of Contents 

of sources. We face risks associated with energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures, and cyberattacks and intrusions, such as computer viruses, malware, attachments to emails, intrusion, and unauthorized access, including from persons inside our organization or from persons outside our organization with access to our systems. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Any compromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary, or commercially sensitive in nature), and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. 

We also are subject to laws, rules, and regulations in the United States, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (the “CCPA” (which became effective on January 1, 2020)), relating to the collection, use, and security of employee and other data. Evolving compliance and operational requirements under the CCPA and the privacy and data security laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. Our failure to comply with laws, rules, and regulations related to privacy and data protection could harm our business or reputation. 

“ROFO/Purchase Option” provisions, such as in our Master Leasing Agreement, may discourage third parties from negotiating with us with respect to the sale of our real property. 

During the term of the Master Leasing Agreement, AIR will have a purchase option on the direct or indirect transfer of any real property owned or, subject to the consent of the landlord, leased by us (including indirect transfers pursuant to a transfer of equity interests in any of our subsidiaries that owns or leases such real property) and any rights to acquire real property, but excluding any property leased from AIR pursuant to the Master Leasing Agreement, with respect to real property for which redevelopment has been substantially completed by Aimco (if applicable) and that has reached a specified occupancy for a minimum time period and a right of first offer with respect to stabilized properties that Aimco is under contract to purchase, but excluding any such transfers in respect of certain of the operating properties. This right of first offer and purchase option may discourage third parties from negotiation with us with respect to the sale of our real property and may limit the number of interested buyers, and further may prevent us from receiving the maximum price that we may otherwise have obtained for such properties. 

There may be, or there may be the appearance of, conflicts of interest in our relationship with AIR. 

There may be, or there may be the appearance of, conflicts of interest in our relationship with AIR. The Separation was designed to minimize conflicts of interest between us and AIR, however, there can be no assurance that such conflicts don’t exist. 

Although we and AIR each have an independent board of directors and independent management and are incentivized to make decisions that are in the best interests of its respective business, Mr. Considine, along with Messrs. Miller and Stein, serve on both our and AIR’s boards of directors, however, such directors will recuse themselves from voting as members of either board of directors during the approval or disapproval of any transactions between the two companies. 

The agreements between us and AIR generally do not limit or restrict AIR or its affiliates from engaging in any business or managing other entities that engage in business of the type conducted by us. Although we and AIR do not generally engage in the same business, AIR and its affiliates may in the future determine to redevelop or develop apartment communities and other real estate assets, some of which may be in close proximity to certain of our apartment communities. Certain business opportunities appropriate for us may also in the future be appropriate for AIR or its affiliates, and we may compete with AIR for certain business opportunities. This may cause us to compete with AIR for business opportunities or result in a change in our current business strategy. 

Actual, potential, or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor dissatisfaction, settlements with stockholders, litigation or regulatory inquiries or enforcement actions. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential, actual, or perceived conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including causing a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us, a decrease in the prices of our equity securities, and a resulting increased risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions. 

Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders. 

Publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. Given our stockholder composition and other factors, it is possible our stockholders or future activist stockholders  

12 

Table of Contents 

may attempt to effect such changes. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by such activist stockholders or others would be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management team from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or changes to the composition of the board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential lenders, partners, or others with whom we do business, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING 

Our debt financing could result in foreclosure of our apartment communities, prevent us from making distributions on our equity, or otherwise adversely affect our liquidity. 

On December 16, 2020, we entered into a new revolving secured credit facility. In connection with the Separation, certain of our subsidiaries retained existing secured property-level debt equal to approximately $449.5 million and another became the obligator on two notes payable to the subsidiaries of AIR with an aggregated principal amount equal to approximately $534.1 million (“Notes Payable to AIR”). Over time, we may become party to one or more additional financing arrangements, including credit facilities or other bank debt, bonds, and mortgage financing.  

In connection with such financing activities, we are subject to the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that our indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of then-existing indebtedness. If we fail to make required payments of principal and interest on our non-recourse debt, our lenders could foreclose on the apartment communities and other collateral securing such debt, which would result in the loss to us of income and asset value. As of December 31, 2020, a significant number of our apartment communities are encumbered by property debt or serve as collateral for the Notes Payable to AIR. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur, and we have significant amounts of debt outstanding. Payments of principal and interest may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our communities or pay distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 

Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing and the cost of available financing and could adversely affect our liquidity. 

Our ability to obtain financing and the cost of such financing depends on the overall condition of the United States credit markets. During periods of economic uncertainty, the United States credit markets may experience significant liquidity disruptions, which may cause the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably and make obtaining financing, both non-recourse property debt and corporate borrowings such as those under our credit facilities, more difficult. In particular, apartment borrowers have benefited from the historic willingness of the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), to make substantial amounts of loans secured by multifamily properties, even in times of economic distress. These two lenders are federally chartered and subject to federal regulation, which is subject to change, making uncertain their prospects and ability to provide liquidity in a future downturn. 

If our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected, we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of liquidity, which could result in lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt and loss of income and asset value, both of which would adversely affect our liquidity. 

Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and reduce our profitability, and the potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results. 

Our new revolving secured credit facility contains variable-rate interest and may be based, in part, on LIBOR. An increase or decrease in LIBOR would likely increase or decrease our interest expense. An increase in interest expense may affect our profitability. 

In addition, in July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In 2018, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), as the alternative to LIBOR. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement remains a question, and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Due to the broad use of LIBOR as a reference rate, all financial market participants, including us, are impacted by the risks associated with this transition. To the extent any of our new revolving secured credit facility is expected to have a variable-rate interest based, in part, on LIBOR and, if LIBOR is no longer available, an alternative benchmark index will likely be proposed to replace it. Accordingly, any of these proposals or the resulting consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, and as a result, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.

Covenant restrictions may limit our operations and impact our ability to make payments to our investors. 

Some of our existing and/or future debt and other securities may contain covenants that restrict our activities. These may include covenants that limit our operations or impact our ability to make distributions or other payments unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied, as well as certain other customary affirmative and negative covenants. 

We may increase leverage in executing our development plan, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness. 

We may decide to increase our leverage to execute our development plan. We will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. Although our credit facilities may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, our governing documents do not limit the amount of debt we may incur, and we may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders. We may incur additional indebtedness from time to time in the future to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our indebtedness could intensify. 

RISKS RELATED TO THE SEPARATION 

We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Separation. 

Following the Separation, we and AIR are two, focused and independent companies. We may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a company independent from AIR in the time we expect, if at all. For instance, it may take longer than anticipated for us to, or we may never, succeed in growing our revenues through our development and redevelopment business. 

The Separation could give rise to disputes or other unfavorable effects, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. 

In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with AIR, effective as of December 15, 2020 (the “Separation Agreement”), which, among other things, contains the agreements among the parties regarding the principal transactions necessary to effect the Separation. It also sets forth other agreements that govern certain aspects of the parties’ ongoing relationship after the completion of the Separation. The Separation may lead to increased operating and other expenses, of both a nonrecurring and a recurring nature, and to changes to certain operations, which expenses or changes could arise pursuant to arrangements made between AIR and us or could trigger contractual rights of, and obligations to, third parties. Disputes with third parties could also arise out of these transactions, and we could experience unfavorable reactions to the Separation from employees, lenders, ratings agencies, regulators, OP unitholders or other interested parties. These increased expenses, changes to operations, disputes with third parties or other effects could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, following the Separation, disputes with AIR could arise in connection with each of the Separation Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Property Management Agreements, the Master Services Agreement, the Master Leasing Agreement, or certain other agreements. 

Although we have endeavored to enter into agreements on market terms, our agreements with AIR may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm’s-length negotiations with unaffiliated third parties. 

The agreements related to the Separation, including the Separation Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Property Management Agreements, the Master Services Agreement, the Master Leasing Agreement, and certain other agreements were entered into in the context of the Separation while both companies were under common control. As a result, although we endeavored to enter into these agreements on market terms, they may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm’s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements entered into in the context of the Separation concern, among other things, allocation of assets and liabilities attributable to periods prior to the Separation and the rights and obligations, including certain indemnification obligations, of AIR and us after the Separation, certain services provided by us to AIR and by AIR to us after the Separation, and our lease from AIR of the Initial Leased Properties.  

Following the Separation, we may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company. 

Following the Separation, AIR hired substantially all of Aimco’s existing employees (including Aimco’s existing property management employees), and Aimco retained approximately 50 employees. We have no significant historical operations as a company independent from AIR and did not, following the Separation, have the infrastructure or personnel necessary to operate as an independent company without relying on AIR to provide certain services (such as those related to technology, payroll, etc.) on an ongoing basis. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Master Services Agreement with AIR pursuant to which AIR will provide certain services to us to allow us to benefit from certain cost efficiencies in sharing certain resources  

14 

Table of Contents 

and personnel. As a separate publicly traded company, Aimco is subject to, and responsible for, regulatory compliance, including periodic public filings with the SEC and compliance with the NYSE continued listing requirements as well as compliance with generally applicable tax and accounting rules, certain elements of which may rely on services provided by AIR under the Master Services Agreement. Because our business has not been operated as a separate company, we cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully implement the infrastructure or retain or hire the personnel necessary to operate as a separate company or that we will not incur costs in excess of anticipated costs to establish such infrastructure and retain or hire such personnel. Because we will not be permitted under the terms of the Master Services Agreement to terminate certain services before the completion of the applicable term, we may be obligated to pay rates for the services higher than those a third party would have paid or that we could have provided to ourselves. 

RISKS RELATED TO TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

Aimco may fail to qualify as a REIT. 

If Aimco fails to qualify as a REIT, Aimco will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and will be subject to United States federal income tax at regular corporate rates. This would substantially reduce our funds available for general corporate usage or for distribution to our investors. Unless entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, Aimco also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition, Aimco’s failure to qualify as a REIT may place us in default under our credit facilities. 

We believe that Aimco operates, and has since its taxable year ended December 31, 1994, operated, in a manner that enables it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. However, qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Moreover, even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Aimco’s continued qualification as a REIT will depend on its satisfaction of certain asset, income, investment, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership, and other requirements on a continuing basis. Aimco’s ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we do not obtain independent appraisals. Aimco’s compliance with the REIT annual income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or other issuers constitutes a violation of the REIT requirements. Moreover, future economic, market, legal, tax, or other considerations may cause Aimco to fail to qualify as a REIT, or the board of directors of Aimco may determine to revoke its REIT status. 

REIT distribution requirements limit our available cash. 

As a REIT, Aimco is subject to annual distribution requirements. Aimco pays distributions, including taxable stock dividends, intended to enable Aimco to satisfy its distribution requirements. This limits the amount of cash available for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. Aimco generally must distribute annually at least 90% of its “real estate investment trust taxable income,” which is generally equivalent to net taxable ordinary income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, in order for its distributed earnings not to be subject to United States federal corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to Aimco’s stockholders to comply with the requirements applicable to REITs under the Code (which may be all cash or combination of cash and stock satisfying the requirements of applicable law). However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell apartment communities or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code. 

Aimco may be subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in certain circumstances. 

Even as a REIT, Aimco may be subject to United States federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as on its undistributed income. Aimco could also be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arm’s-length transactions between Aimco and a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) and on any net income from sales of apartment communities that were held for sale primarily in the ordinary course. State and local tax laws may not conform to the United States federal income tax treatment, and Aimco may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions in which Aimco transacts business. Any taxes imposed on Aimco would reduce our operating cash flow and net income and could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends and distributions. 

Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. 

REITs are entitled to a United States federal tax deduction for dividends paid to their stockholders. As compared to other taxable corporations, this ability to reduce or eliminate the REIT’s taxable income by paying dividends to stockholders is a  

15 

Table of Contents 

principal benefit of maintaining REIT status, generally resulting in a lower combined tax liability of the REIT and its stockholders as compared to that of the combined tax liability of other taxable corporations and their stockholders. Notwithstanding this combined benefit, dividends payable by REITs may result in marginally higher taxes to the stockholder. 

C-corporations are generally required to pay United States federal income tax on earnings. After tax earnings are then available for stockholder dividends. The maximum United States federal tax rate applicable to income from “qualified dividends” payable to United States stockholders that are individuals, trusts, and estates is currently 20%, plus the 3.8% investment tax surcharge. While dividends payable by REITs are generally not eligible for the qualified dividend reduced rates, stockholders that are individuals, trusts, or estates, and meet certain requirements, may generally deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of ordinary dividends from REITs. This deduction is available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, and will generally cause the maximum tax rate for ordinary dividends from REITs to be 29.6%, plus the 3.8% investment tax surcharge. The more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts, and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the shares of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including Aimco Common Stock. 

Complying with the REIT requirements may cause Aimco to forgo otherwise attractive business opportunities. 

To qualify as a REIT, Aimco must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amounts distributed to Aimco stockholders, and the ownership of Aimco stock. As a result of these tests, Aimco may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when Aimco does not have funds readily available for distribution, forgo otherwise attractive investment opportunities, liquidate assets in adverse market conditions, or contribute assets to a TRS that is subject to regular corporate federal income tax. 

Changes to United States federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect Aimco and Aimco’s stockholders. 

The present United States federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial, or administrative action at any time, which could affect the United States federal income tax treatment of an investment in Aimco Common Stock. The United States federal income tax rules dealing with REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, and the United States Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect Aimco or Aimco’s stockholders. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect Aimco’s ability to qualify as a REIT and the tax considerations relevant to an investment in Aimco Common Stock, or could cause Aimco to change its investments and commitments. 

RISKS RELATED TO AIMCO OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS 

There are restrictions on the ability to transfer and redeem Aimco Operating Partnership Units, there is no public market for Aimco Operating Partnership Units and holders of Aimco Operating Partnership Units are subject to dilution. 

The Aimco Operating Partnership agreement restricts the transferability of Aimco Operating Partnership Units (“OP Units”). Until the expiration of a one-year holding period, subject to certain exceptions, investors may not transfer OP Units without the consent of Aimco Operating Partnership’s general partner. Thereafter, investors may transfer such OP Units subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the general partner’s right of first refusal. In addition, after the expiration of the one-year holding period, investors have the right, subject to the terms of Aimco Operating Partnership’s agreement, to require Aimco Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of such investor’s OP Units (in exchange for shares of Aimco Common Stock or cash, in Aimco Operating Partnership’s discretion) once per quarter on an exchange date set by Aimco Operating Partnership, provided such investor provides notice at least 45 days prior to the quarterly exchange date. See “Description of Aimco Operating Partnership Units and Summary of Aimco Operating Partnership Agreement—Redemption Rights of Qualifying Parties”. There is no public market for the OP Units. Aimco Operating Partnership has no plans to list any OP Units on a securities exchange. It is unlikely that any person will make a market in the OP Units, or that an active market for the OP Units will develop. If a market for the OP Units develops and the OP Units are considered “readily tradable” on a “secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof),” Aimco Operating Partnership would be classified as a publicly traded partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could have a material adverse effect on Aimco Operating Partnership and its unitholders. 

In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership may issue an unlimited number of additional OP Units or other securities for such consideration and on such terms as it may establish, without the approval of the holders of OP Units. Such securities could have priority over the OP Units as to cash flow, distributions, and liquidation proceeds. The effect of any such issuance may be to dilute the interests of holders of OP Units.

Table of Contents 

Cash distributions by Aimco Operating Partnership are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with partnership performance. 

Aimco Operating Partnership does not intend to make regular distributions to holders of OP Units (other than what is required for Aimco to maintain its REIT status). There can be no assurance regarding the amounts of available cash that Aimco Operating Partnership will generate or the portion that its general partner will choose to distribute. The actual amounts of available cash will depend upon numerous factors, including profitability of operations, required principal and interest payments on its debt, the cost of acquisitions (including related debt service payments), its issuance of debt and equity securities, fluctuations in working capital, capital expenditures, adjustments in reserves, prevailing economic conditions, and financial, business, and other factors, some of which may be beyond Aimco Operating Partnership’s control. Cash distributions depend primarily on cash flow, including from reserves, and not on profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. Therefore, cash distributions may be made during periods when the Aimco Operating Partnership records losses and may not be made during periods when it records profits. The Aimco Operating Partnership agreement gives the general partner discretion in establishing reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership’s business that will affect the amount of available cash. Aimco Operating Partnership may be required to make reserves for the future payment of principal and interest under its credit facilities and other indebtedness. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership’s credit facilities may limit its ability to distribute cash to holders of OP Units. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance regarding actual levels of cash distributions on OP Units, and Aimco Operating Partnership’s ability to distribute cash may be limited during the existence of any events of default under any of its debt instruments. 

Holders of Aimco OP Units have limited voting rights and are limited in their ability to effect a change of control. 

Aimco Operating Partnership is managed and operated by its general partner, Aimco. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, holders of OP Units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting Aimco Operating Partnership’s business. Such matters relate to certain amendments of the partnership agreement and certain transactions such as the institution of bankruptcy proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors and certain transfers by the general partner of its interest in Aimco Operating Partnership or the admission of a successor general partner. Holders of OP Units have no right to elect the general partner on an annual or other continuing basis, or to remove the general partner. As a result, holders of OP Units have limited influence on matters affecting the operation of Aimco Operating Partnership, and third parties may find it difficult to attempt to gain control over, or influence the activities of, Aimco Operating Partnership. 

The limited partners of Aimco Operating Partnership are unable to remove the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership or to vote in the election of Aimco’s directors unless they own shares of Aimco. In order to comply with specific REIT tax requirements, Aimco’s charter has restrictions on the ownership of its equity securities. As a result, Aimco Operating Partnership limited partners and Aimco stockholders are limited in their ability to effect a change of control of Aimco Operating Partnership and Aimco, respectively. 

Holders of OP Units may not have limited liability in specific circumstances. 

The limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some states. If it were determined that Aimco Operating Partnership had been conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute, or that the right or the exercise of the right by the holders of OP Units as a group to make specific amendments to the agreement of limited partnership or to take other action under the agreement of limited partnership constituted participation in the “control” of Aimco Operating Partnership’s business, then a holder of OP Units could be held liable under specific circumstances for Aimco Operating Partnership’s obligations to the same extent as the general partner. 

Aimco may have conflicts of interest with holders of OP Units. 

Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership and its affiliates (including Aimco), on the one hand, and Aimco Operating Partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. The directors and officers of the general partner have fiduciary duties to manage the general partner in a manner beneficial to Aimco, as the sole stockholder of the general partner. At the same time, as the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership, it has fiduciary duties to manage Aimco Operating Partnership in a manner beneficial to Aimco Operating Partnership and its limited partners. The duties of the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership to Aimco Operating Partnership and its partners may therefore come into conflict with the duties of the directors and officers of the general partner to its sole stockholder, Aimco. Such conflicts of interest might arise in the following situations, among others: 

•  

decisions of the general partner with respect to the amount and timing of cash expenditures, borrowings, issuances of additional interests and reserves in any quarter, will affect whether or the extent to which there is available cash to make distributions in a given quarter; 

17 

Table of Contents 

•  

whenever possible, the general partner seeks to limit Aimco Operating Partnership’s liability under contractual arrangements to all or particular assets of Aimco Operating Partnership, with the other party thereto having no recourse against the general partner or its assets; 

•  

any agreements between Aimco Operating Partnership and the general partner and its affiliates will not grant to the holders of OP Units, separate and distinct from Aimco Operating Partnership, the right to enforce the obligations of the general partner and such affiliates in favor of Aimco Operating Partnership. Therefore, the general partner, in its capacity as the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership, will be primarily responsible for enforcing such obligations; and 

•  

under the terms of the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement, the general partner is not restricted from causing Aimco Operating Partnership to pay the general partner or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to Aimco Operating Partnership or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of such entities on behalf of Aimco Operating Partnership. Neither the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement nor any of the other agreements, contracts, and arrangements between Aimco Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership and its affiliates, on the other, are or will be the result of arm’s-length negotiations. 

Provisions in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement may limit the ability of a holder of OP Units to challenge actions taken by the general partner. 

Delaware law provides that, except as provided in a partnership agreement, a general partner owes the fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the partnership and its limited partners. The Aimco Operating Partnership agreement expressly authorizes the general partner to enter into, on behalf of Aimco Operating Partnership, a right of first opportunity arrangement and other conflict avoidance agreements with various affiliates of Aimco Operating Partnership and the general partner, on such terms as the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, believes are advisable. The latitude given in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement to the general partner in resolving conflicts of interest may significantly limit the ability of a holder of OP Units to challenge what might otherwise be a breach of fiduciary duty. The general partner believes, however, that such latitude is necessary and appropriate to enable it to serve as the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership without undue risk of liability. 

The Aimco Operating Partnership agreement limits the liability of the general partner for actions taken in good faith. Aimco Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement expressly limits the liability of the general partner by providing that the general partner, and its officers and directors, will not be liable or accountable in damages to Aimco Operating Partnership, the limited partners, or assignees for errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or omission if the general partner or such director or officer acted in good faith. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership is required to indemnify the general partner, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses, judgments, fines, and other actions incurred by the general partner or such other persons, provided that Aimco Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (i) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law or (ii) for any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement. The provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and the general partner has not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict the fiduciary duties of the general partner that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 

Aimco Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries may be prohibited from making distributions and other payments. 

All of Aimco Operating Partnership’s real estate assets are owned by subsidiaries of Aimco Operating Partnership. As a result, Aimco Operating Partnership depends on distributions and payments from its subsidiaries in order to satisfy our financial obligations and make payments to our equity holders, as applicable. The ability of Aimco Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to make such distributions and other payments depends on their earnings and cash flows and may be subject to statutory or contractual limitations. As an equity investor in the REIT subsidiaries and our subsidiaries, our right to receive assets upon their liquidation or reorganization are effectively subordinated to the claims of their creditors and any holders of preferred equity senior to our equity investments. To the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of such subsidiaries, our claims may still be subordinate to any security interest in or other lien on their assets and to any of their debt or other obligations that are senior to our claims.
