Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. For these reasons, management also uses these measures in part to assess its performance. 

These non-GAAP measures include organic revenue, adjusted revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted cash flow from operations, adjusted net earnings (including per share amounts) and free cash flow. 

Organic revenue includes reported revenue (adjusted revenue for 2014) plus pre-acquisition revenue for companies acquired during the applicable reporting periods. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation in 2014.

Adjusted revenue (2014) includes reported revenue and is increased by $9 million for a negotiated contract cash settlement for the extinguishment of certain contractual minimums with a reseller. Although the 2014 cash settlement has no contractual performance obligation, under GAAP the cash settlement revenue is amortized in this circumstance over the remaining relationship with the reseller. 

EBITDA is earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Adjusted EBITDA (2014 comparative data) includes the contract cash settlement revenue and excludes certain acquisition, integration and severance costs. 

Adjusted EBITDA (2013 comparative data) excludes adjustments related to the 2010 acquisition of Capco and certain International restructuring charges.

Adjusted net earnings (2014 comparative data) excludes the after-tax impact of certain acquisition, integration, severance and refinancing costs as well as acquisition-related amortization and includes the after-tax impact of adjusted revenue. 

Adjusted net earnings (2013 comparative data) excludes the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization, a net benefit related to a gain on the mFoundry acquisition, certain International restructuring charges, debt issuance and refinancing costs and adjustments related to the Capco acquisition.

Adjusted net earnings per diluted share, or adjusted EPS, is equal to adjusted net earnings divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 

Adjusted cash flow from operations (2014 comparative data) is GAAP cash flow from operations as adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations, and excludes certain payments for contingent purchase price and incentive compensation programs associated with the 2010 acquisition of Capco and the premium paid related to the early redemption of senior notes.

Adjusted cash flow from operations (2013 comparative data) is GAAP cash flow from operations as adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations and excludes the premium paid related to the early redemption of senior notes.

Free cash flow is adjusted operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. 

Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS’ non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS Web site, www.fisglobal.com.
