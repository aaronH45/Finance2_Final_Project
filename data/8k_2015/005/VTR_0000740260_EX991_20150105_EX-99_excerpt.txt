VENTAS DECLARES PRORATED DIVIDEND IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITION OF AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL HEALTHCARE TRUST, INC. 

CHICAGO, IL (January 5, 2015) — Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a prorated dividend on the Company’s common stock, conditioned upon the completion of its pending acquisition of American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCT) (“HCT”) pursuant to a merger of HCT with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Ventas (the “Merger”). 

The dividend will be payable in cash to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective (the “Effective Time”). The per share dividend amount payable by Ventas will be equal to the Company’s most recent quarterly dividend rate ($0.79), multiplied by the number of days elapsed since the Company’s last dividend record date (December 22, 2014) through and including the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs, divided by the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such dividend is declared (90). 

The Merger is expected to occur on or after January 16, 2015, subject to the approval of stockholders of HCT and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. HCT has scheduled a special meeting of stockholders to consider and vote upon the proposed acquisition and related matters on January 15, 2015. There can be no assurance that all such closing conditions will be satisfied by January 16, 2015, that the Effective Time will occur on January 16, 2015 or that the Merger will occur.

(i) changes in general economic conditions or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete, and the effect of those changes on the Company’s revenues, earnings and funding sources;

(l) final determination of the Company’s taxable net income for the year ended December 31, 2014; (m) the ability and willingness of the Company’s tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases, the Company’s ability to reposition its properties on the same or better terms in the event of nonrenewal or in the event the Company exercises its right to replace an existing tenant or manager, and obligations, including indemnification obligations, the Company may incur in connection with the replacement of an existing tenant or manager; (n) risks associated with the Company’s senior living operating portfolio, such as factors that can cause volatility in the Company’s operating income and earnings generated by those properties, including without limitation national and regional economic conditions, costs of food, materials, energy, labor and services, employee benefit costs, insurance costs and professional and general liability claims, and the timely delivery of accurate property-level financial results for those properties; (o) changes in exchange rates for any foreign currency in which the Company may, from time to time, conduct business; (p) year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index or the UK Retail Price Index and the effect of those changes on the rent escalators contained in the Company’s leases and the Company’s earnings; (q) the Company’s ability and the ability of its tenants, operators, borrowers and managers to obtain and maintain adequate property, liability and other insurance from reputable, financially stable providers; (r) the impact of increased operating costs and uninsured professional liability claims on the Company’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations or that of the Company’s tenants, operators, borrowers and managers, and the ability of the Company and the Company’s tenants, operators, borrowers and managers to accurately estimate the magnitude of those claims; (s) risks associated with the Company’s MOB portfolio and operations, including the Company’s ability to successfully design, develop and manage MOBs, to accurately estimate its costs in fixed fee-for-service projects and to retain key personnel; (t) the ability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses the Company’s MOBs are located and their affiliated health systems to remain competitive and financially viable and to attract physicians and physician groups;
