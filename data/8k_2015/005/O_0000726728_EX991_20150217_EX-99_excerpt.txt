CEO Comments on Operating Results 

“We are pleased to report excellent operating performance for the fourth quarter and for 2014 with AFFO per share increasing by 4.8% to $0.65 during the quarter, and 6.6% to $2.57 during the year,” said John P. Case, Realty Income’s Chief Executive Officer. “This earnings growth allowed us to increase dividends paid per share by 2.1% in 2014, and another 3.0% this month. Our company was recognized in January 2015 for its track record of outstanding, long-term dividend growth. Realty Income was added to the exclusive S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats® index for increasing our dividend every year for 20 years.” 

“During the year, we completed $1.4 billion in acquisitions, which makes this our second most acquisitive year in the company’s history. These properties had an attractive initial average lease yield of 7.1% and weighted average remaining lease term of 12.8 years. We continued to remain selective in our investment activity, acquiring 5.8% of the $24.3 billion of sourced acquisitions opportunities during the year. We funded the 2014 investments by issuing $1.3 billion in permanent and long-term capital, of which more than half was equity. Additionally, as of February 13, 2015, we had approximately $1.12 billion available on our credit facility to fund future acquisitions. Given the healthy volume of acquisitions opportunities we are currently seeing, we are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2015 from $500 million - $800 million to $700 million - $1 billion.”

“Our existing portfolio of over 4,300 properties continues to perform well. In 2014, we experienced one of our most active years for lease rollover. We re-leased 203 properties with expiring leases to either existing or new tenants, recapturing 99.3% of expiring rent. We realized same store rent increases of 1.7% for the fourth quarter and 1.5% for 2014. We also sold 46 properties for $107 million realizing a 6.9% cap rate on the leased properties sold and an 11.6% unlevered internal rate of return on all properties sold. Our proactive approach to portfolio management resulted in occupancy increasing to 98.4% at the end of 2014, the highest it’s been since 2007.” 

Financial Results 

Revenue 

Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 increased 14.5% to $247.6 million, as compared to $216.2 million for the same quarter in 2013. Revenue for 2014 increased 19.6% to $933.5 million, as compared to $780.2 million for 2013. 

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders 

Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was $71.0 million, as compared to $53.9 million for the same quarter in 2013. Net income per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was $0.32, as compared to $0.26 for the same quarter in 2013. 

Net income available to common stockholders for 2014 was $227.6 million, as compared to $203.6 million for 2013. Net income per share in 2014 was $1.04, as compared to $1.06 for 2013. 

Net income available to common stockholders per share for 2014 was impacted by a $6.0 million non-cash redemption charge on the shares of the 6.75% Monthly Income Class E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Class E preferred stock, that were redeemed in October 2014, which represents $0.03 net income per share. This charge is for the excess in redemption value over the carrying value of the Class E preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006. Net income available to common stockholders for 2013 was impacted by an an unusually large gain on sale of real estate, which represented $0.18 per share. 

The calculation to determine net income for a real estate company includes impairments and/or gains on property sales. Impairments and/or gains on property sales vary from quarter to quarter. This variance can significantly impact net income and period to period comparisons. 

Funds From Operations (FFO) Available to Common Stockholders 

FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 increased 15.3% to $143.7 million, as compared to $124.6 million for the same quarter in 2013. FFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 increased 4.9% to $0.64, as compared to $0.61 for the same quarter in 2013. 

FFO for 2014 increased 21.8% to $562.9 million, as compared to $462.0 million for the same period in 2013. FFO per share in 2014 increased 7.1% to $2.58, as compared to $2.41 for 2013. 

FFO per share for 2014 was impacted by a $6.0 million non-cash redemption charge on the Class E preferred shares that were redeemed in October 2014, which represents $0.03 per share. 

Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) Available to Common Stockholders 

AFFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 increased 15.7% to $145.4 million, as compared to $125.7 million for the same quarter in 2013. AFFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 increased 4.8% to $0.65, as compared to $0.62 for the same quarter in 2013. 

AFFO for 2014 increased 21.3% to $561.7 million, as compared to $463.1 million for 2013. AFFO per share for 2014 increased 6.6% to $2.57, as compared to $2.41 for 2013. 

The company considers FFO and AFFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of a Real Estate Investment Trust’s (REIT’s) operating performance. Realty Income defines FFO consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s (NAREIT’s) definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairments of real estate, reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items. FFO for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2013 has also been normalized to add back merger-related costs for the acquisition of ARCT. AFFO further adjusts FFO for unique revenue and expense items, which the company believes are not as pertinent to the measurement of the company’s ongoing operating performance. See the reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and AFFO on page six.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, Realty Income invested $158.0 million in 82 new properties and properties under development or expansion, located in 26 states. These properties are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of approximately 14.6 years and an initial average lease yield of 7.1%. The tenants occupying the new properties operate in 19 industries, and the property types consist of 87.3% retail and 12.7% industrial and distribution, based on rental revenue. Approximately 32% of the revenue generated from acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2014 is from investment grade tenants.

The new properties are located in 42 states and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of approximately 12.8 years and an initial average lease yield of 7.1%. The tenants occupying the new properties operate in 32 industries, and the property types consist of 85.7% retail, 6.6% industrial and distribution, 6.4% office, and 1.3% manufacturing, based on rental revenue. Approximately 66% of the revenue generated from the 2014 acquisitions is from investment grade tenants.

FFO and AFFO Commentary 

Realty Income’s FFO and AFFO per share has historically tended to be stable and fairly predictable because of the long-term leases that are the primary source of the company’s revenue. There are, however, several factors that can cause FFO and AFFO per share to vary from levels that have been anticipated by the company. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates and occupancy rates, periodically accessing the capital markets, the level and timing of property and entity acquisitions and dispositions, lease rollovers, the general real estate market, and the economy. 

2015 Earnings Estimates 

FFO per share for 2015 should range from $2.67 to $2.72 per share, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 FFO per share of $2.58. FFO per share for 2015 is based on a net income per share range of $0.97 to $1.02, plus estimated real estate depreciation of $1.77 per share, and reduced by potential estimated gains on sales of investment properties of $0.07 per share (in accordance with NAREIT’s definition of FFO). 

AFFO per share for 2015 should range from $2.66 to $2.71 per share, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over the 2014 AFFO per share of $2.57. AFFO further adjusts FFO for unique revenue and expense items, which are not as pertinent to the measurement of the company’s ongoing operating performance.
