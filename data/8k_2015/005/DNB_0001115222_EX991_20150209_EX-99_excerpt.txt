Dividend Increase

Dun & Bradstreet today announced that it has declared an increased quarterly cash dividend of $0.4625 per share, up from Dun & Bradstreet’s prior quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. This quarterly cash dividend is payable on March 11, 2015, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 24, 2015.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reported results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges which may be recurring, such as legal and other professional expenses associated with the ongoing China investigation, because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. 

Non-GAAP results are presented only as a supplement to the financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the reader’s understanding of our underlying financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as an alternative measure of revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income or EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Dun & Bradstreet reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - How We Manage Our Business” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2013, filed February 28, 2014 with the SEC, for a further discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related notes are presented and defined in Schedule 5 attached to this press release. 

Effective January 1, 2015, in addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company will report results on an “As Adjusted” basis which are before restructuring charges, other non-core gains and charges (such as gains and losses on sales of businesses, impairment charges and tax settlements), acquisition related fees (such as deal related costs for bankers, legal fees, diligence costs and retention payments) and acquisition related amortization expense, because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations.

N/M - Not Meaningful

The following defines the non-GAAP measures used to evaluate performance:

*Total revenue excluding the revenue of divested and shut-down businesses is referred to as “core revenue.” Core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition

*Core revenue growth, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, is referred to as “core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange.” We also separately, from time to time, analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components, “organic core revenue growth” and “core revenue growth from acquisitions”

*Results (such as operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate and diluted earnings per share) exclude Restructuring Charges (whether recurring or non-recurring) and certain other items that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance. We refer to these Restructuring Charges and other items as “non-core gains and (charges)”
