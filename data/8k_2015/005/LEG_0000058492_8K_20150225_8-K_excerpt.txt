Adoption of 2015 Individual Performance Goals  

On February 25, 2015, the Compensation Committee adopted individual performance goals (“IPGs”) for our named executive officers. We expect that twenty percent of each executive’s cash award under our 2014 Key Officers Incentive Plan will be based on the achievement of the IPGs and will be included in the 2015 award formula adopted by the Committee at the end of March 2015. The goals for 2015 are:  

David S. Haffner: Strategic planning, business unit portfolio management, acquisition integration;  

Karl G. Glassman: Business unit portfolio management, margin enhancement, revenue growth, acquisition integration, profitability of targeted businesses;  

Matthew C. Flanigan: Information technology and risk management initiatives, leadership development;  

Perry E. Davis: Acquisition objectives, growth of targeted businesses, leadership development;  

Joseph D. Downes, Jr.: Because of Mr. Downes’ retirement from his current position, to be effective April 5, 2015, no IPGs were assigned; and  

Jack D. Crusa: Capital improvements, growth and restructuring of targeted businesses, purchasing initiatives.  

The achievement of the individual performance goals is measured by the following schedule.
