FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ADDITIONAL  

INFORMATION DISCLOSURE 

2 

This presentation contains forward-looking statements, including statements about our financial condition, results of operations, asset quality trends,  

capital levels and profitability. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by words such as “outlook,” “goal,” “objective,” “plan,” “expect,”  

“anticipate,” “assume,” “intend,” “project,” “believe,” or “estimate.” Forward-looking statements represent management’s current expectations and  

forecasts regarding future events. If underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could vary  

materially from these projections or expectations.  

Risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: (1) deterioration of commercial real estate market fundamentals; (2) declining asset prices; (3)  

adverse changes in credit quality trends; (4) changes in local, regional and international business, economic or political conditions; (5) the extensive  

and increasing regulation of the U.S. financial services industry; (6) increasing capital and liquidity standards under applicable regulatory rules; (7)  

unanticipated changes in our liquidity position, including but not limited to, changes in the cost of liquidity, our ability to enter the financial markets and  

to secure alternative funding sources; (8) our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiary, KeyBank; (9) downgrades in our credit ratings or those of  

KeyBank; (10) operational or risk management failures by us or critical third-parties; (11) breaches of security or failures of our technology systems  

due to technological or other factors and cybersecurity threats; (12) adverse judicial proceedings; (13) the occurrence of natural or man-made  

disasters or conflicts or terrorist attacks; (14) a reversal of the U.S. economic recovery due to economic, political or other shocks; (15) our ability to  

anticipate interest rate changes and manage interest rate risk; (16) deterioration of economic conditions in the geographic regions where we operate;  

(17) the soundness of other financial institutions; (18) our ability to attract and retain talented executives and employees, to effectively sell additional  

products or services to new or existing customers, and to manage our reputational risks; (19) our ability to timely and effectively implement our  

strategic initiatives; (20) increased competitive pressure due to industry consolidation; (21) unanticipated adverse effects of acquisitions and  

dispositions of assets or businesses; and (22) our ability to develop and effectively use the quantitative models we rely upon in our business planning.  

We provide greater detail regarding these factors in our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent filings, which are available online at www.key.com/ir and  

www.sec.gov. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and Key does not undertake any obligation to update the forward- 

looking statements to reflect new information or future events.  

This presentation also includes certain Non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “Tier 1 common equity,” “pre-provision net  

revenue,” and “cash efficiency ratio.” Management believes these ratios may assist investors, analysts and regulators in analyzing Key’s financials.  

Although Key has procedures in place to ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components, they have  

limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of results under GAAP. For more information on  

these calculations and to view the reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the Appendix to this presentation and to  

page 99 of our 2013 Form 10-K.
