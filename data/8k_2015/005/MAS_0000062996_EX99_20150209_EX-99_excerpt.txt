2014 Fourth Quarter Operating Segment Highlights

Allman. “Our portfolio of industry-leading plumbing businesses continues to perform, delivering increased revenue and profit growth, which resulted in a record sales year for both Delta Faucet and Hansgrohe. New products and program wins at Behr Process and Liberty Hardware drove the performance of our Decorative Architectural segment, and our Installation and Other Services segment capitalized on the housing recovery and ongoing growth of its commercial business. Our window businesses also benefitted from improving macro trends in their respective markets and continued success from recently introduced products. While our Cabinet and Related Products segment faced lingering demand challenges from an ERP implementation, we believe we are taking the necessary actions to position it for profitability in 2015.” 

2014 Full-Year Commentary 

· Net sales increased 4 percent to $8.5 billion, compared to 2013 

· Compared to full-year 2013, results for key financial measures, as adjusted for certain items (see Exhibit A) and with a normalized tax rate of 36 percent, were as follows: 

· Gross profit margins were 28.4 percent compared to 28.0 percent

“2014 was a notable year for Masco,” said Keith Allman. “Our customer-focused innovation as well as our productivity improvements and cost control yielded steady sales growth and substantially improved margins. Our balance sheet continues to improve as we ended the year with $1.7 billion of liquidity. Throughout the year we also took a number of actions to drive shareholder value. In September, we announced the spin-off of our Services Business and remain on-track for it to be complete by mid-year 2015. Additionally, the restructuring of our corporate office has resulted in a leaner operating model, yielding annual savings of approximately $35-40 million. Furthermore, our commitment to returning capital to shareholders was enhanced through an increase in our dividend and a new share repurchase authorization. During the fourth quarter of 2014 we repurchased 1.4 percent of our outstanding shares or 5 million shares.” 

2015 Outlook 

“Our strong execution in 2014 gives us momentum as we enter 2015,” continued Mr. Allman. “We remain committed to serving the customer by accelerating our innovation pipeline and continuing our strong operating performance. We expect to gain share and drive consumer demand as we leverage our industry-leading brands and new products. We are confident in our ability to execute in this improving environment and believe the strategic initiatives we announced in 2014 will drive shareholder value as we move into 2015.”
