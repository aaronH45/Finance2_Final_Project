CHARLOTTE — Bank of America Corporation today reported net income of $3.1 billion, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $3.4 billion, or $0.29 per diluted share in the year-ago period. Revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis(B) was $19.0 billion, compared to $21.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

Results for the most recent quarter include three adjustments that, in aggregate, reduced revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 by $1.2 billion (pretax) and lowered earnings per share by $0.07. These adjustments were a $578 million negative market-related net interest income (NII) adjustment, driven by the acceleration of bond premium amortization on the company's debt securities portfolio due to lower long-term interest rates; a one-time transitional charge of $497 million related to the adoption of funding valuation adjustments on uncollateralized derivatives in the company's Global Markets business; and $129 million in net DVA losses related to a tightening of the company's credit spreads. This compares with $210 million in positive market-related NII adjustments and $618 million in net DVA losses in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of FVA in the current period and the net DVA and market-related NII adjustments in both periods, revenue was $20.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $22.1 billion in the year-ago quarter(H). Approximately $720 million of the decline from the fourth quarter of 2013 was due to lower gains from the sales of debt securities and equity investment income, and the remainder was attributable to lower mortgage banking income and lower trading account profits. 

Noninterest expense declined from $17.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013 to $14.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, the lowest quarterly expense reported by the company since the Merrill Lynch merger. Credit quality also continued to improve, with the provision for credit losses declining from $336 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 to $219 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, while the charge-off ratio was the lowest in a decade.

2014 Calendar Year Net Income $4.8 Billion

For the full year, net income was $4.8 billion, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $11.4 billion, or $0.90 per diluted share in 2013. Revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis(B) was $85.1 billion in 2014, compared to $89.8 billion in 2013. 

Noninterest expense was $75.1 billion, compared to $69.2 billion in 2013. Excluding litigation expense of $16.4 billion in 2014 and $6.1 billion in 2013, noninterest expense was $58.7 billion in 2014, down $4.4 billion, or 7 percent, from 2013(C). 

"In 2014, we continued to invest in our businesses while reducing expenses and resolving our most significant litigation matters," said Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan. "Last quarter, consumer deposits and loan originations were solid; wealth management client balances grew to $2.5 trillion; we increased lending to middle-market and large companies; and we retained a leadership position in investment banking. There's more work and tremendous opportunity ahead as we improve on the platform we've built to serve our customers and clients, and we enter 2015 in good shape to manage both the opportunities and the challenges the markets and economy will offer."

"We continued our focus on optimizing the balance sheet this quarter, building capital and managing expenses in a challenging interest rate and geopolitical environment," said Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson. "Credit quality remained strong, reflecting the improving economy and our solid risk underwriting."

Net interest income, on an FTE basis(B), was $9.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, down $1.1 billion from the year-ago quarter. The decline was driven by a $788 million negative swing year-over-year in market-related adjustments as discussed above, and lower loan balances and yields. These were partially offset by lower rates paid on deposits and lower long-term debt balances and yields. Excluding the impact of the market-related adjustments, net interest income was $10.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $10.5 billion in the prior quarter and $10.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

Noninterest income decreased 15 percent from the year-ago quarter to $9.1 billion. Excluding the impact of the adoption of FVA in the current period, and net DVA and equity investment income in both periods, noninterest income was down 10 percent from the year-ago quarter, driven by declines in sales and trading results as well as mortgage banking(H). This was partially offset by higher card income and higher investment and brokerage services income. 

The provision for credit losses declined $117 million from the fourth quarter of 2013 to $219 million, driven by improved credit quality. Net charge-offs declined $703 million, or 44 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2013 to $879 million, with the net charge-off ratio falling to 0.40 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 0.68 percent in the year-ago quarter. The decline in net charge-offs from the fourth quarter of 2013 was driven by continued improvement in the portfolio trends including increased home prices. During the fourth

quarter of 2014, the reserve release was $660 million, compared to a reserve release of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Noninterest expense was $14.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $17.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decline was driven by lower litigation expense (principally mortgage-related) and reduced personnel expense. Litigation expense declined to $393 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 from $2.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Excluding litigation expense, noninterest expense decreased 8 percent from the year-ago quarter to $13.8 billion, reflecting continued progress to realize cost savings and improve efficiency(C). 

Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS), the business unit that is responsible for servicing residential mortgage and home equity loans, continued to make solid progress in its efforts to reduce expenses. Noninterest expense, excluding litigation, declined to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $1.3 billion in the prior quarter and $1.8 billion in the year-ago quarter as the number of 60+ days delinquent loans was reduced to 189,000 from 221,000 in the prior quarter and 325,000 in the year-ago quarter(D).

The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 29.2 percent, compared to 10.6 percent in the year-ago quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate from the fourth quarter of 2013 was driven by the absence in the current quarter of certain discrete tax benefits from the year-ago quarter.

•Preferred Rewards continues to expand, resulting in broader and deeper client relationships. Through the end of 2014, approximately 1.2 million clients have enrolled in the program. 

Financial Overview

Consumer and Business Banking reported net income of $1.8 billion, compared to $2.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decline was driven by higher provision for credit losses as a result of the slowing pace of improvements in credit quality. Higher noninterest income, driven by an increase in card income, was offset by lower net interest income as a result of lower yields and loan balances, leaving revenue stable for the comparative periods.

Noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, in line with the year-ago quarter. Driven by the continued growth in mobile banking and other self-service customer touchpoints, the company reduced its retail footprint by another 92 banking centers during the fourth quarter of 2014 to 4,855 locations. Return on average allocated capital was 24 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to 26 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.

•Bank of America Merrill Lynch was named No. 1 Global Research firm in 2014 by Institutional Investor magazine for the fourth year in a row.

Financial Overview

Global Markets reported a net loss of $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to a net loss of $47 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower sales and trading revenue, mostly offset by lower litigation expense and smaller net DVA losses. The current quarter was also negatively impacted by a one-time transitional charge of $497 million related to the adoption of funding valuation adjustments on uncollateralized derivatives(A). 

Revenue decreased $828 million, or 26 percent, from the year-ago quarter to $2.4 billion. Excluding net DVA/FVA losses of $626 million in the current quarter and net DVA losses of $618 million in the year-ago quarter, revenue decreased $820 million to $3.0 billion(J). The year-ago quarter also included approximately $220 million in recoveries on certain legacy Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) positions. Excluding net DVA/FVA losses and the recoveries on legacy positions in the year-ago quarter, Global Markets sales and trading revenue declined approximately $400 million to $2.4 billion(J). On this same basis, FICC sales and trading revenue declined to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 from $1.9 billion in the year-ago quarter, driven by declines in credit and mortgages due to lower client activity, partially offset by stronger results in foreign exchange and rates(K).

Equities sales and trading revenue was up modestly from the year-ago quarter to $911 million(L).

Noninterest expense of $2.5 billion decreased $775 million from the year-ago quarter due to a $652 million reduction in litigation expense, as well as a decrease in revenue-related incentives.

ALM activities encompass the whole-loan residential mortgage portfolio and investment securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities including the residual net interest income allocation, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

All Other reported a net loss of $378 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to net income of $496 million for the same period a year ago, primarily due to declines in both net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. 

Net interest income declined $760 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of a $788 million negative swing in market-related NII adjustments driven by the acceleration of bond premium amortization on the company's debt securities portfolio due to lower long-term interest rates. 

Noninterest income declined $542 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower equity investment income and lower gains on sales of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline in equity investment income was primarily attributable to the sale of an equity investment in the year-ago quarter and lower Global Principal Investment (GPI) results compared to the year-ago quarter, as the GPI portfolio has been actively winding down over the past several years.

The benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $144 million from the year-ago quarter to a benefit of $332 million. Income tax was a benefit of $527 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to a benefit of $870 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the prior period tax benefits attributable to the resolution of certain tax matters and benefits from non-U.S. restructurings.

Noninterest expense declined primarily as a result of lower litigation expense and infrastructure support costs compared with the year-ago quarter.

2 Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases during the period; quarterly results are annualized.

3 Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties ratios are calculated as nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties divided by outstanding loans, leases and foreclosed properties at the end of the period.

4 Allowance for loan and lease losses ratios are calculated as allowance for loan and lease losses divided by loans and leases outstanding at the end of the period.

Note: Ratios do not include loans measured under the fair value option.

Credit quality continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2014, with net charge-offs declining across most major portfolios when compared to the year-ago quarter. The number of 30+ days performing delinquent loans, excluding fully-insured loans, declined across all consumer portfolios from the year-ago quarter, remaining at record-low levels in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Additionally, reservable criticized balances and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties also continued to decline, down 10 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from the year-ago period.

Net charge-offs were $879 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, down from $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2014, and $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. The provision for credit losses declined to $219 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 from $336 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by continued improvement in the portfolio trends including increased home prices. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the reserve release was $660 million, compared to a reserve release of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.

The allowance for loan and lease losses to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio was 4.14 times in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to 2.78 times in the fourth quarter of 2013. The allowance to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio, excluding PCI, was 3.66 times in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2.38 times in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were $12.6 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease from $14.2 billion at September 30, 2014 and $17.8 billion at December 31, 2013.

1 Regulatory capital ratios are preliminary. 

2 On January 1, 2014, the Basel 3 rules became effective, subject to transition provisions primarily related to regulatory deductions and adjustments impacting common equity tier 1 capital and tier 1 capital.

3 Basel 3 common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets on a fully phased-in basis are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, refer to page 18 of this press release. The company's fully phased-in Basel 3 estimates are based on its current understanding of the Standardized and Advanced approaches under the Basel 3 rules, assuming all relevant regulatory model approvals, except for the potential reduction to risk-weighted assets resulting from removal of the Comprehensive Risk Measure surcharge. These estimates are expected to evolve over time as the company's businesses change and as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. regulatory agencies. The Basel 3 rules require approval by banking regulators of certain models used as part of risk-weighted asset calculations. If these models are not approved, the company's risk-weighted assets and resulting capital ratios would likely be adversely impacted, which in some cases could be significant. The company continues to evaluate the potential impact of proposed rules.

4 Tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 22-24 of this press release.

The common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Standardized Transition approach for measuring risk-weighted assets was 12.3 percent at December 31, 2014 and 12.0 percent at September 30, 2014.

While the Basel 3 fully phased-in Standardized and fully phased-in Advanced approaches do not go into effect until 2018, the company is providing the following estimates for comparative purposes.

The estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Standardized approach on a fully phased-in basis was 10.0 percent at December 31, 2014, compared to 9.5 percent at September 30, 2014(E).

The estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches on a fully phased-in basis was 9.6 percent at both December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2014, despite an increase in operational risk-weighted assets during the fourth quarter(E). 

At December 31, 2014, the estimated supplementary leverage ratio (SLR)(F) for the Bank Holding Company was approximately 5.9 percent, which exceeds the 5.0 percent minimum for bank holding companies, and the estimated SLR for the company's primary banking

entity was approximately 7.0 percent at December 31, 2014(F), which exceeds the 6.0 percent required minimum. 

At December 31, 2014, Global Excess Liquidity Sources totaled $439 billion, up from $429 billion at September 30, 2014 and $376 billion at December 31, 2013. Time-to-required funding was 39 months at December 31, 2014, compared to 38 months at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 10.52 billion and 10.59 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013. 

Tangible book value per share of common stock(G) was $14.43 at December 31, 2014, compared to $13.79 at December 31, 2013. Book value per share was $21.32 at December 31, 2014, compared to $20.71 at December 31, 2013.

End Notes

This press release uses non-GAAP financial measures. The company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional clarity in assessing its results. Other companies may define or calculate these measures differently.

(A)In the fourth quarter of 2014, Bank of America adopted a funding valuation adjustment on uncollateralized derivatives in the company's Global Markets business. This methodology seeks to account for the value of funding costs today rather than accruing the cost over the life of the derivatives. The adoption resulted in a one-time transitional charge of $497 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 in the company's Global Markets business.

(E)Basel 3 common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets on a fully phased-in basis are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to page 18 of this press release. On January 1, 2014, the Basel 3 rules became effective, subject to transition provisions primarily related to regulatory deductions and adjustments impacting Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital and Tier 1 capital. The company's estimates under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches may be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve. If our internal analytical models are not approved or are required to be revised, it would likely lead to an increase in our risk-weighted assets and negatively impact our capital ratios, which in some cases could be significant. The company continues to evaluate the potential impact of proposed rules.

(F)The supplementary leverage ratio is based on estimates from our current understanding of recently finalized rules issued by banking regulators on September 3, 2014. The estimated ratio is measured using quarter-end tier 1 capital calculated under Basel 3 on a fully phased-in basis. The denominator is calculated as the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet assets as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures at the end of each month in the quarter, including, among other items, derivatives and securities financing transactions.

(5) Regulatory capital ratios are preliminary.

(6) On January 1, 2014, the Basel 3 rules became effective, subject to transition provisions primarily related to regulatory deductions and adjustments impacting common equity tier 1 capital and Tier 1 capital. We reported under Basel 1 (which included the Market Risk Final Rules) at December 31, 2013. Basel 3 common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets on a fully phased-in basis are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, see above. The Corporation’s fully phased-in Basel 3 estimates and the supplementary leverage ratio are based on its current understanding of the Standardized and Advanced approaches under the Basel 3 rules. Under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches, risk-weighted assets are determined primarily for market risk and credit risk, similar to the Standardized approach, and also incorporate operational risk. Market risk capital measurements are consistent with the Standardized approach, except for securitization exposures, where the Supervisory Formula Approach is also permitted, and certain differences arising from the inclusion of the CVA capital charge in the credit risk capital measurement. Credit risk exposures are measured using internal ratings-based models to determine the applicable risk weight by estimating the probability of default, loss given default and, in certain instances, exposure at default. The internal analytical models primarily rely on internal historical default and loss experience. The calculations under Basel 3 require management to make estimates, assumptions and interpretations, including the probability of future events based on historical experience. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. These estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, but do not include the benefit of the removal of the surcharge applicable to the comprehensive risk measure. Our estimates under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches may be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve. If our internal analytical models are not approved or are required to be revised, it would likely lead to an increase in our risk-weighted assets and negatively impact our capital ratios, which in some cases could be significant.

Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures

(Dollars in millions)

The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, the Corporation uses the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.

The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.

In addition, the Corporation evaluates its business segment results based on measures that utilize average allocated capital. The Corporation allocates capital to its business segments using a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The Corporation's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. Return on average allocated capital is calculated as net income, adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average allocated capital. Allocated capital and the related return both represent non-GAAP financial measures. Allocated capital is reviewed periodically and refinements are made based on multiple considerations that include, but are not limited to, business segment exposures and risk profile, regulatory constraints and strategic plans. As part of this process, in the first quarter of 2014, the Corporation adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to its business segments. This change resulted in a reduction of the unallocated capital, which is reflected in All Other, and an aggregate increase to the amount of capital being allocated to the business segments. Prior periods were not restated.

See the tables below and on pages 23-24 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to financial measures defined by GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the three months ended December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.
