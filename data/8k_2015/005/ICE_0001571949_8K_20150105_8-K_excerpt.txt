Effective January 5, 2015, after notice of approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (the “Company”) amended and restated its bylaws to make technical changes to the definition of “senior officers” entitled to indemnification by the Company. These changes expanded the list of senior officers entitled to indemnification to be consistent with the group of officers indemnified by the Company prior to the merger with NYSE Euronext in November 2013. In particular, the definition of senior officers was expanded to include the Company’s Chief Strategic Officer, Chief Technology Officer and General Counsel, as well as any officer designated by the Company’s board of directors or compensation committee and any employee deemed an officer under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

The full text of the amended and restated bylaws, which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, are incorporated herein by reference.
