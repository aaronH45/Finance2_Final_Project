Item 8.01 Other Events.

In November 2014, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to better serve our customers. Our life sciences business, excluding the nucleic acid solutions division, together with the chemical analysis business will merge to form a new segment called life sciences and applied markets business. Our diagnostics and genomics businesses will combine and will include the nucleic acid solutions division of our life sciences business to become the diagnostics and genomics segment. Finally, the Agilent crosslab segment will be formed from our services and consumables businesses. We are furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide selected segment information that reflect changes in our reportable segments related to the changes in our organizational structure.
