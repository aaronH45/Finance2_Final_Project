•Non-GAAP income from continuing operations of $139 million, or $0.41 per share(1) 

•Orders of $995 million and revenues of $1.03 billion

•Fiscal year 2015 revenue guidance of $4.06 billion to $4.12 billion, and non-GAAP earnings guidance at $1.67 to $1.73 per share(2) 

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 17, 2015 - Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $995 million, up 2 percent over one year ago, for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2015, and revenues of $1.03 billion, also up 2 percent compared with one year ago. Orders and revenues each grew 6 percent on a currency adjusted basis (3). 

First-quarter GAAP income from continuing operations was $102 million, or $0.30 per share. Last year’s first-quarter GAAP income from continuing operations was $121 million, or $0.36 per share. 

During the first quarter, Agilent had intangible amortization of $43 million, transformation costs of $12 million and a tax benefit of $24 million. Excluding these items and $6 million of other net costs, Agilent reported first-quarter adjusted income from continuing operations of $139 million, or $0.41 per share(1).

“Agilent delivered a solid start to the year,” said Bill Sullivan, Agilent CEO. “The strength of our core analytical business drove our success, offsetting currency headwinds and challenges within our diagnostics and genomics business.”

“Looking ahead, we are confident in the strength of our new product portfolio to sustain growth as well as our ability to address some current business challenges and accelerate achievement of our long-term operating model,” said Mike McMullen, Agilent president, COO and CEO-elect.

Given the reorganization of Agilent’s businesses, announced in November 2014, Q1 financial results for the company’s three new business units reference restated comparisons.

First-quarter revenues of $547 million from Agilent’s Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (LSAG) rose 2 percent year over year (up 5 percent adjusted for currency(3)) on broad-based growth across most product lines and regions. LSAG’s operating margin was 19.6 percent in the quarter.

Q1 revenues of $331 million from the Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) rose 5 percent year over year (up 10 percent adjusted for currency(3)), reflecting solid growth across Agilent’s analytical services and consumables business. ACG’s operating margin was 20.7 percent in the quarter.

First-quarter revenues of $148 million from the Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) declined 6 percent year over year (down 1 percent adjusted for currency(3)). Strength in companion diagnostics was offset by regulatory expenses and manufacturing issues that were resolved late in the quarter. DGG’s operating margin was 0.5 percent in the quarter.

Agilent’s second-quarter 2015 revenues are expected to be in the range of $985 million to $1,005 million. Second-quarter non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.41 per share(2).

For fiscal year 2015, Agilent expects revenues of $4.06 billion to $4.12 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $1.67 to $1.73 per share(2). The guidance is based on Jan. 31, 2015 exchange rates. Foreign currency movements have a very negative impact on Agilent’s revenues and profits, but the company has taken actions on all fronts to mitigate the effects.

(1)Non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations per share exclude primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, pre-separation costs, transformation initiatives and restructuring costs, NMR business exit, and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

(2)Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q2 FY15 and full fiscal year 2015 excludes primarily the impact of acquisition and integration costs, future restructuring costs, asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $45 million per quarter.

(3)Revenue excluding the impact of currency is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation between GAAP revenue and non-GAAP revenue is set forth on page 7 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

(a) The adjustment for taxes excludes tax benefits that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. For the three months ended January 31, 2015 and 2014 , management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20% and 16%, respectively, that we believe to be indicative of on-going operations.

Historical amounts are reclassified to conform with current presentation.

We provide non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, acquisition and integration costs, NMR business exit and pre-separation costs. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.

Restructuring costs include incremental expenses incurred in the period associated with publicly announced major restructuring programs, usually aimed at material changes in business and/or cost structure. Such costs may include one-time termination benefits, asset impairments, facility-related costs and contract termination fees. 

Transformational initiatives include expenses incurred in the period associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, small site consolidations, reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs.

Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination which have been expensed during the period. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs.

Pre-separation costs include Agilent-specific incremental expenses incurred in order to effect the separation, through November 1, 2014 distribution date. 

Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.

Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles, net loss on debt extinguishment and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.

Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.

(a) We compare the year-over-year change in revenue excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to assess the performance of our underlying business. To determine the impact of currency fluctuations, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the actual exchange rate in effect during the respective prior periods.

The preliminary reconciliation of GAAP revenue adjusted for the impact of currency is estimated based on our current information.
