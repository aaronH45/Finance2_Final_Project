Verisign Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Results

RESTON, VA - Feb. 5, 2015 - VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRSN), a global leader in domain names and Internet security, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014.

Fourth Quarter GAAP Financial Results

VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Verisign”) reported revenue of $256 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, up 4.2 percent from the same quarter in 2013. Verisign reported net income of $65 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.48 for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to net income of $292 million and diluted EPS of $1.94 in the same quarter in 2013. The operating margin was 55.6 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 53.0 percent for the same quarter in 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted EPS was decreased by $0.19 primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and a change in estimate for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets in 2014. 

As described in the fourth quarter 2013 earnings news release, results for the fourth quarter of 2013 included an income tax benefit related to a worthless stock deduction, pre-tax non-operating gains from the sale of certain cost-method investments, and an income tax expense related to estimated taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of a planned repatriation of offshore assets in 2014, which collectively increased net income by $217.8 million and increased diluted EPS by $1.45. 

Fourth Quarter Non-GAAP Financial Results

Verisign reported, on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $95 million and diluted EPS of $0.70 for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to net income of $98 million and diluted EPS of $0.65 for the same quarter in 2013. The non-GAAP operating margin was 59.4 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 56.9 percent for the same quarter in 2013. Results for the fourth quarter of 2013 included a pre-tax, non-operating gain of $15.8 million from the sale of certain cost-method investments which increased non-GAAP net income by $11.4 million and diluted EPS by $0.07. 

A table reconciling the GAAP to the non-GAAP results (which excludes items described below) is appended to this release.

“In 2014, Verisign marked more than 17 years of uninterrupted availability of the .com and .net domain name system, and continued to build on its financial performance since completing the divestitures in 2010, including exceeding $1 billion in annual revenues. During the year we repurchased 16.3 million shares, returning $867 million to shareholders,” commented Jim Bidzos, executive chairman, president and chief executive officer.

2014 GAAP Financial Results

Verisign reported net income of $355 million and diluted EPS of $2.52 in 2014, compared to net income of $544 million and diluted EPS of $3.49 in 2013. The operating margin for 2014 was 55.9 percent compared to 54.7 percent in 2013. Net income for 2014 was decreased by $10 million and diluted EPS was decreased by $0.07 primarily due to the fourth quarter 2014 non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and changes in estimates during 2014 for U.S. income taxes related to the 2013 worthless stock deduction and the 2014 repatriation of offshore assets. 

As described in the fourth quarter 2013 earnings news release, results for 2013 included an income tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter related to a worthless stock deduction, pre-tax non-operating gains from the sale of certain cost-method investments, and income tax expense related to estimated taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of a planned repatriation of offshore assets in 2014, which collectively increased net income by $217.8 million and increased diluted EPS by $1.39. 

2014 Non-GAAP Financial Results

Verisign reported, on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $383 million and diluted EPS of $2.72 for 2014, compared to net income of $374 million and diluted EPS of $2.40 in 2013.

Verisign provides quarterly and annual financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Along with this information, we typically disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial information in our quarterly earnings release, on investor conference calls and during investor conferences and related events. This non-GAAP financial information does not include the following types of financial measures that are included in GAAP: stock-based compensation, unrealized gain/loss on contingent interest derivative on subordinated convertible debentures, and non-cash interest expense. Non-GAAP net income is decreased by amounts accrued, if any, during the period for contingent interest payable resulting from upside or downside triggers related to the subordinated convertible debentures and is adjusted for a 28 percent tax rate, which differs from the GAAP tax rate.

Management believes that this non-GAAP financial data supplements the GAAP financial data by providing investors with additional information that allows them to have a clearer picture of our operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the non-GAAP information enhances investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and the comparability of our operating results from period to period. Above, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial information that we provide each quarter with the comparable financial information reported in accordance with GAAP for the given period.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

(Unaudited)

Following the offering of the 4.625% senior notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), we disclose our Adjusted EBITDA for the periods shown below. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the Notes. Adjusted EBITDA refers to net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, unrealized loss (gain) on contingent interest derivative on the subordinated convertible debentures and unrealized loss (gain) on hedging agreements.

The following table reconciles GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods shown below (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Verisign’s management believes that presenting Adjusted EBITDA enhances investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and the comparability of our operating results from period to period. However, Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool. These limitations include, but are not limited to, the following: 

•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;

•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;

•non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating its ongoing operating performance for a particular period; and

•other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
