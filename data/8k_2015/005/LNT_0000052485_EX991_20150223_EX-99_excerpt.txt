ALLIANT ENERGY ANNOUNCES 2014 EARNINGS OF $3.48 PER SHARE

2014 results consistent with 2014 earnings guidance, affirms 2015 earnings guidance

MADISON, Wis. - February 23, 2015 - Alliant Energy Corporation (NYSE: LNT) today announced U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP consolidated earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for 2014 and 2013 as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“In 2014, we once again delivered solid financial and operational results,” said Patricia Kampling, Alliant Energy Chairman, President and CEO. “I am proud of our ability to grow earnings while minimizing increases for customers. We also successfully completed two major emission controls projects on time and below budget.”

Utilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy’s Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $3.37 per share of non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2014, which was $0.13 per share higher than 2013. The primary drivers of higher EPS in 2014 when compared to 2013 were lower capacity charges related to the Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) Duane Arnold Energy Center (DAEC) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL) Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (Kewaunee) purchased power agreements. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by retail electric customer billing credits at IPL; higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL; higher generation, distribution and customer service operation and maintenance expenses; lower year-over-year electric and gas sales attributed to weather; and higher depreciation expense at both IPL and WPL.

Non-regulated and Parent - Alliant Energy’s Non-regulated and Parent operations generated $0.11 per share of non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2014, which was $0.04 per share higher than 2013.

Earnings Adjustments - 2013 non-GAAP EPS excludes net losses of $0.02 per share from adjustments consisting of charges associated with preferred stock redemptions at IPL and WPL, and a regulatory-related credit at IPL related to its Whispering Willow - East wind project due to a December 2013 Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) order. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 5 of this document for additional details of the earnings adjustments for 2013.

“Our weather-normalized 2014 results were in-line with the guidance we released in the fourth quarter of 2013,” said Patricia Kampling. “Lower income tax expense at IPL enabled us to increase operation and maintenance expenses, which were used to enhance reliability and customer service.”

Retail electric customer billing credits at IPL - In September 2014, IPL received an order from the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) approving a settlement agreement and joint motion to extend IPL’s Iowa retail electric base rate freeze through 2016 and provide retail electric customer billing credits of $105 million in aggregate, by targeting credits of $70 million in 2014, $25 million in 2015 and $10 million in 2016. IPL began crediting customer bills in May 2014.

Lower income tax expense at IPL due to Iowa rate-making practices - Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with certain property-related differences (including mixed service cost and repair deductions) at IPL are accounted for differently than other subsidiaries of Alliant Energy due to rate-making practices in Iowa. Such property-related differences at IPL were higher in 2014 as compared to 2013 largely due to additional engineering expenditures for the Marshalltown Generating Station, a portion of which qualified for mixed service cost deductions, and additional repairs deductions recognized due to clarifications of the recently issued Internal Revenue Service guidance for generation property.

2015 Earnings Guidance

Alliant Energy is affirming its 2015 earnings per share guidance as follows:

Drivers for Alliant Energy’s 2015 earnings guidance include, but are not limited to:

•Ability of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of return

•Stable economy and resulting implications on utility sales

•Normal weather and operating conditions in its utility service territories

•Continuing cost controls and operational efficiencies

•Execution of IPL’s and WPL’s capital expenditure and financing plans

•Consolidated effective tax rate of 17%

The 2015 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, discontinued operations, impacts from the sales of the Minnesota distribution assets, future changes in laws or regulations, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities from valuation allowances and organizational structure changes, pending lawsuits and disputes, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings or changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy.

“The projected growth in earnings between 2014 and 2015 is consistent with our projected long-term annual earnings growth rate of 5 to 7%,” said Kampling. “Our investments in cleaner and more efficient generation were a major driver of the earnings growth. These investments were incorporated into the rate base calculations for the IPL and WPL retail electric base rate freezes approved through 2016.”
