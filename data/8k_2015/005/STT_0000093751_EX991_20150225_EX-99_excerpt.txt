2 Forward-looking statements This presentation contains forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws, including statements relating to our goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, investment portfolio performance and strategies, the financial and market outlook, governmental and regulatory initiatives and developments, and the business environment. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by such forward-looking terminology as “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “objective,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,” “may,” “will,”, “focus”, “trend,” “target,” “strategy” and “goal,” or similar statements or variations of such terms. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, are based on current assumptions that are difficult to predict and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements, and those statements should not be relied upon as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to February 25, 2015. Important factors that may affect future results and outcomes include, but are not limited to: the financial strength and continuing viability of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposure, including, for example, the direct and indirect effects on counterparties of the sovereign-debt risks in the U.S., Europe and other regions; increases in the volatility of, or declines in the level of, our net interest revenue, changes in the composition or valuation of the assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition (and our ability to measure the fair value of investment securities) and the possibility that we may change the manner in which we fund those assets; the liquidity of the U.S. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities and inter-bank credits, and the liquidity requirements of our clients; the level and volatility of interest rates, the valuation of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we record revenue or accrue expenses and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the U.S. and internationally; the credit quality, credit-agency ratings and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of the respective securities and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income; our ability to attract deposits and other low-cost, short-term funding, the relative portion of our deposits that are determined to be operational under regulatory guidelines and our ability to deploy deposits in a profitable manner consistent with our liquidity requirements and risk profile; the manner and timing with which the Federal Reserve and other U.S. and foreign regulators implement changes to the regulatory framework applicable to our operations, including implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Basel III final rule and European legislation (such as the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives); among other consequences, these regulatory changes impact the levels of regulatory capital we must maintain, acceptable levels of credit exposure to third parties, margin requirements applicable to derivatives, and restrictions on banking and financial activities. In addition, our regulatory posture and related expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in regulatory expectations for global systemically important financial institutions applicable to, among other things, risk management, capital planning and compliance programs, and changes in governmental enforcement approaches to perceived failures to comply with regulatory or legal obligations; adverse changes in the regulatory ratios that we are required or will be required to meet, whether arising under the Dodd-Frank Act or the Basel III final rule, or due to changes in regulatory positions, practices or regulations in jurisdictions in which we engage in banking activities, including changes in internal or external data, formulae, models, assumptions or other advanced systems used in the calculation of our capital ratios that cause changes in those ratios as they are measured from period to period; increasing requirements to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve or our other U.S. and non-U.S. regulators for the use, allocation or distribution of our capital or other specific capital actions or programs, including acquisitions, dividends and stock purchases, without which our growth plans, distributions to shareholders, share repurchase programs or other capital initiatives may be restricted; changes in law or regulation, or the enforcement of law or regulation, that may adversely affect our business activities or those of our clients or our counterparties, and the products or services that we sell, including additional or increased taxes or assessments thereon, capital adequacy requirements, margin requirements and changes that expose us to risks related to the adequacy of our controls or compliance programs; financial market disruptions or economic recession, whether in the U.S., Europe, Asia or other regions; our ability to promote a strong culture of risk management, operating controls, compliance oversight and governance that meet our expectations and those of our clients and our regulators; the results of, and costs associated with, governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, litigation and similar claims, disputes, or proceedings; the potential for losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds; the possibility that our clients will incur substantial losses in investment pools for which we act as agent, and the possibility of significant reductions in the liquidity or valuation of assets underlying those pools; our ability to anticipate and manage the level and timing of redemptions and withdrawals from our collateral pools and other collective investment products; the credit agency ratings of our debt and depository obligations and investor and client perceptions of our financial strength; adverse publicity, whether specific to State Street or regarding other industry participants or industry-wide factors, or other reputational harm; our ability to control operational risks, data security breach risks and outsourcing risks, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business and the possibility that our controls will prove insufficient, fail or be circumvented; our ability to expand our use of technology to enhance the efficiency, accuracy and reliability of our operations and our dependencies on information technology and our ability to control related risks, including cyber-crime and other threats to our information technology infrastructure and systems and their effective operation both independently and with external systems, and complexities and costs of protecting the security of our systems and data; our ability to grow revenue, manage expenses, attract and retain highly skilled people and raise the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements and expectations; changes or potential changes to the competitive environment, including changes due to regulatory and technological changes, the effects of industry consolidation and perceptions of State Street as a suitable service provider or counterparty; changes or potential changes in the amount of compensation we receive from clients for our services, and the mix of services provided by us that clients choose; our ability to complete acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, including the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required and the ability to satisfy closing conditions; the risks that our acquired businesses and joint ventures will not achieve their anticipated financial and operational benefits or will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated, that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected negative synergies or liabilities will be experienced, that client and deposit retention goals will not be met, that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced, and that disruptions from the transaction will harm our relationships with our clients, our employees or regulators; our ability to recognize emerging needs of our clients and to develop products that are responsive to such trends and profitable to us, the performance of and demand for the products and services we offer, and the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk; changes in accounting standards and practices; and changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that affect the amount of taxes due. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements are set forth in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent SEC filings. We encourage investors to read these filings, particularly the sections on risk factors, for additional information with respect to any forward-looking statements and prior to making any investment decision. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of the date hereof, February 25, 2015, and we do not undertake efforts to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after that date.

41 1 Represents operating-basis (non-GAAP) financial information. Operating-basis financial outlook is a non- GAAP presentation. Refer to Appendix included with this presentation for explanations of our non-GAAP measures. 2 Long-term operating basis financial goals: EPS growth of 10%-15%; revenue growth of 8%-12%; and ROE of 12%-15%. Our long-term goals do not reflect near-term expectations. Delivering shareholder value in a challenging environment • Continuing to focus on key priorities: – Delivering value-added services and solutions to clients – Investing in growth initiatives – Managing expenses – Returning capital to shareholders • 2015 operating-basis outlook1: – Strong growth in our fee revenue – Total fee revenue growth expected to outpace expense growth by at least 200 basis points compared to 2014 – Net interest revenue (NIR) impacted by low interest rate environment – Higher effective tax rate – Likely preferred share issuance • Optimizing opportunities for returns while satisfying a multitude of regulatory requirements • Maintaining our long-term financial goals2  

42 1 Includes impact of expected currency and market changes. Operating-basis (non-GAAP) financial information, where noted. Operating-basis financial outlook is a non-GAAP presentation. Refer to Appendix included with this presentation for explanations of our non-GAAP measures. 2015 Outlook1 - Foreign exchange assumptions using the forward curve as of January 15, 2015 assume that the exchange rates will remain with January 15, 2015 levels; resulting assumptions for U.S. dollar to EUR exchange rate and U.S. dollar to Pound Sterling are shown below as examples: • Expecting that NIR headwinds are likely to continue as illustrated in the interest rate and deposit scenarios outlined on slide 45 • Expecting an operating-basis1 effective tax rate of 30%-32%, which was 29% in 2014 S&P 500 15E vs 14 EAFE 15E vs 14 2013 Year End: 1850 2014 Year End: 2060 2015 Estimated Year End: 2160 4.9% 2013 Year End: 1915 2014 Year End: 1775 2015 Estimated Year End: 1830 3.1% 2014 Average: 1931 2015 Estimated Average: 2050 6.2% 2014 Average: 1888 2015 Estimated Average: 1850 (2.0)% USD vs EUR 15E vs 14 USD vs GBP 15E vs 14 2013 Year End: 1.37 2014 Year End: 1.20 2015 Estimated Year End: 1.16 (3.3)% 2013 Year End: 1.67 2014 Year End: 1.56 2015 Estimated Year End: 1.51 (3.2)% 2014 Average: 1.32 2015 Estimated Average: 1.16 (12.1)% 2014 Average: 1.65 2015 Estimated Average: 1.51 (8.5)% • Aiming for full-year 2015 operating-basis1 total fee revenue growth of 4%-7% compared to 2014: - Equity market assumptions for full-year 2015 based on: Strong growth in our fee revenue, partially offset by the impact of low interest rates and a higher effective tax rate  

43 2015 Outlook1 Full-year 2015 operating-basis1 total fee revenue growth expectation of 4%-7% compared to 2014 driven by: • Continued innovation in services and solutions • Expected increase in new business levels • Strong capabilities outside of U.S. 2015 revenue growth aligned with our long-term objectives: • 2015 operating-basis1 total fee revenue objective includes approximately $200 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation: − Expected operating-basis1 total fee revenue growth would be approximately 6.5%-9.5% if exchange rates were unchanged from average rates in 2014 − Expected operating-basis1 total fee revenue growth includes less support from equity market appreciation relative to long- term average 1 Includes operating-basis (non-GAAP) financial information, where noted. Operating-basis financial outlook is a non-GAAP presentation. Refer to Appendix included with this presentation for explanations of our non-GAAP measures. Strong fee revenue growth providing foundation for achieving our long-term goals  

44 1 Includes operating-basis (non-GAAP) financial information, where noted. Operating-basis financial targets are a non-GAAP presentation. Refer to Appendix included with this presentation for explanations of our non-GAAP measures. 2 See slide 42 for related assumptions. 3 Operating leverage is defined as the rate of growth of total revenue less the rate of growth of total expenses, each as determined on an operating basis. 2015 Outlook1 • Expense management remains a priority; while there continues to be upward pressure on regulatory compliance costs, our focus will be on: – Controlling expenses and driving further efficiencies – Expanding our capabilities to meet increasing regulatory expectations – Supporting new business growth, including information technology costs – Continuing to fund growth initiatives • Expect operating-basis1 total fee revenue growth to outpace operating-basis1 expense growth by at least 200 basis points compared to 2014: – Assumes that 4%-7% operating basis1 total fee revenue growth objective is achieved2 • Positive operating leverage3 remains a long-term goal; our near-term ability to achieve the goal is likely predicated on higher market interest rates for a significant portion of 2015 • Seasonality pattern of compensation expenses, primarily associated with the deferred incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes, to recur with related incremental seasonal amount expected to be $140 million to $150 million in 1Q15, compared to $146 million in 1Q14 Expense management remains a priority

Operating-basis financial targets are a non-GAAP presentation. Refer to Appendix included with this presentation for explanations of our non- GAAP measures. 2 Underlying interest rate and deposit level assumptions are as presented on this slide 45 under the Static Scenario and the Rising Scenario, as applicable.

For all other primary drivers, assumptions reflect actual levels and other data, including State Street’s expectations and interpretations, as of year-end 2014. 2015 Outlook1 Illustrative Scenarios As illustrated below, operating-basis1 NIR likely to decline in 2015 from 2014  

46 We reported a 4Q14 operating-basis1 Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 1.04%. Excluding excess deposits, the 4Q14 operating-basis NIM1 would have been approximately 1.30% 1 Includes operating-basis (non-GAAP) financial information, where noted. Operating-basis financial targets are a non-GAAP presentation.

Expected improvement in NIM1 over long term Long Term Scenarios Fed Funds Rate 10 Year Treasury Rate Long Term Operating- Basis1 NIM Primary Assumptions2 “Static Interest Rate” Scenario – Including Excess Deposits 0.25% 2.17% 80-85bps • 4Q14 average balances, but Dec. 31, 2014 interest rates remain static, all else being equal • Stable credit spreads • Current estimate is that it will take approximately 6 years for the long term operating-basis1 NIM to settle to these levels, all else being equal “Static Interest Rate” Scenario – Excluding Excess Deposits 0.25% 2.17% 95-100bps “Structurally Lower than Normal” Scenario 2.00% 3.50% 150-160bps • Excess deposits leave when interest rates rise • After the portfolio has a chance to fully re-price at the higher levels, all else being equal • Stable credit spreads • Current estimate is that it will take approximately 4 years after the last interest rate increase for the long term operating-basis1 NIM to increase to these levels, all else being equal “Return to Normal” Scenario 3.00% 5.00% 175-185bps Illustrative Scenarios  

47 Optimizing capital to satisfy a multitude of regulatory requirements • Maintaining our 10% common equity tier 1 target: – The standardized approach is currently more constraining for us than the advanced approaches • Expect the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) to be our constraining capital requirement when effective: – Additional preferred share issuance can help with meeting this requirement and, at present, the cost is less than common equity • May have to issue additional long-term debt – depending on final Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements • May be impacted by Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) Buffer requirements: – Particularly related to the inclusion of non-operational deposits • Uncertainty from evolving regulatory environment • Returning capital to shareholders remains a priority: – Over the long term, capital distribution capacity driven primarily by ROE less balance sheet growth  

48 2015 Outlook • Continuing to execute on our capital plans • Issued $750 million of preferred shares at 6% in 4Q14, with the first dividend to be paid in 1Q15: – Expect total dividends on all series of preferred shares outstanding at December 31, 2014 to be approximately $118 million in 2015, including a partial quarter payment of approximately $3 million in 1Q15 for Series E • The evolution of our balance sheet and of regulatory capital and liquidity expectations may lead to both additional issuances of preferred shares of approximately $750 million and long-term debt in 2015 • 2015 capital plan remains subject to review by the Federal Reserve Returning capital to shareholders remains a priority

51 Appendix Footnotes to Slide 4 Non-GAAP Measures The foregoing presentation includes financial information presented on a GAAP basis as well as on a non-GAAP, or “operating basis.” Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Street’s normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources, such as interest revenue from tax-exempt investment securities and processing fees and other revenue associated with tax-advantaged investments, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investor’s understanding and analysis of State Street’s underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared and reported in conformity with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in conformity with GAAP.
