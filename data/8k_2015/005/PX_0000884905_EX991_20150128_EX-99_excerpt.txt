 Sales in the fourth quarter were $2,990 million, 3% above the prior-year quarter excluding negative currency translation effects. Organic sales growth was driven by increased volumes, including volume growth from new plant start-ups, and higher price across the Americas and Asia.

 Fourth-quarter cash flow from operations of $772 million funded $482 million of capital expenditures. The company paid $189 million of dividends and repurchased $282 million of stock, net of issuances.  

 For the full year of 2014, reported net income was $1,694 million and diluted earnings per share was $5.73. On an adjusted basis, full-year net income was $1,852 million and diluted earnings per share was $6.27, 5% and 6% above the prior year, respectively.*  

 Full-year sales were $12,273, 6% above 2013 excluding negative currency translation. Growth was driven by higher volumes, pricing and acquisitions. Reported operating profit was $2,608 million. Adjusted operating profit of $2,746 million was 6% above 2013, excluding negative currency translation.*  

 For the full year, cash flow from operations was strong at $2,868 million, 23% of sales. After capital expenditures of $1,689 million, free cash flow was a record $1,179 million. The company invested $206 million in acquisitions, including several U.S. packaged gas distributors. The company paid dividends of $759 million and repurchased $759 million of stock, net of issuances. The debt-to-capital ratio was 59.6% and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.3x. After-tax return on capital and return on equity for the year were 12.7% and 28.7%, respectively.*  

 Commenting on the financial results and business outlook, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, “Praxair’s operational and capital discipline again yielded high-quality results in 2014, despite a challenging global environment. We generated strong operating cash flow of $2.9 billion that represented 23% of sales and record free cash flow of $1.2 billion. Operating and EBITDA margins grew to new highs.  

 “Sales growth of 6% and EPS growth of 9%, ex-currency, reflect strong price attainment across all of our businesses, relentless cost control and volume growth in the Americas and Asia. The acquisitions that we executed during the year were consistent with our strategy of improving geographic density in our core gases business.  

 “Looking forward to 2015, we expect modest global growth. More than half of our sales are generated in North America and with our industry-leading presence we will continue to take advantage of the underlying economic strengths of the region. While we continue to see slowing macro-economic trends in the rest of the world, our diverse end-markets and strong local teams will continue to drive resilient operating results and increasing cash flow. We are committed to high-quality growth and expect continued strong cash flow generation to fund new projects, increased dividends and ongoing share repurchases.”  

 For full-year 2015, Praxair expects sales in the range of $12 billion to $12.4 billion. This sales guidance assumes a negative currency impact of about 6% versus 2014. The company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.50, up 5% to 11% ex-currency from 2014.* Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.7 billion and the effective tax rate is forecasted to remain at about 28%.  

 For the first quarter of 2015, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.39 to $1.47. This EPS guidance assumes a negative currency impact of approximately 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
