•Mead Johnson expects full year 2015 GAAP EPS, excluding any continuing MTM adjustments, to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.00. 

“We are pleased with our overall performance in 2014,” said Chief Executive Officer Kasper Jakobsen. “The geographic diversity of our business allowed us to succeed in a more challenging global economic environment. We delivered strong volume growth in our North America/Europe and Latin America segments, which helped mitigate lower growth in China/Hong Kong. Our U.S. business performed especially well as we gained market share and expanded our children’s business. Non-GAAP EPS grew 7% on a reported sales increase of 5%, despite higher dairy cost and foreign exchange headwinds.” 

 (1) Reported sales growth by segment for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 12 percent for North America/Europe, (4) percent for Latin America and 1 percent for Asia. 

(2) Non-GAAP results exclude Specified Items. For a description of Specified Items and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, see the schedules titled “Supplemental Financial Information” and “Reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results.”

(3)Reported sales growth by segment for full year 2014 was one percent for Latin America, nine percent for North America/Europe, and five percent for Asia.

Fourth Quarter Company Results

Sales were $1,094.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, up three percent from $1,060.7 million in the same period a year ago. Constant dollar sales increased eight percent; five percent from price and three percent from volume. Foreign exchange adversely affected sales growth by five percent. Gross margin was lower than the prior year quarter due mainly to higher dairy costs and adverse foreign exchange. Earnings before interest and income taxes (“EBIT”) were also negatively impacted by unfavorable MTM adjustments due to updated actuarial assumptions. EBIT totaled $209.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $203.9 million for the comparative period in 2013.

The company’s effective tax rate (“ETR”) was 19.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to 18.8 percent in the prior year quarter. The ETR in 2013 was lower because of a decision to permanently invest certain prior years’ foreign earnings and profits abroad.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, GAAP and non-GAAP EPS increased four percent and 12 percent, respectively, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. On a GAAP basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $158.4 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $152.5 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders totaled $186.2 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $167.2 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago. 

Fourth Quarter Segment Results

The North America/Europe segment sales of $337.8 million were up 12 percent from $300.7 million in the same period a year ago. Constant dollar sales increased 14 percent; 11 percent from volume and three percent from price. Foreign exchange adversely affected sales growth by two percent. Sales growth was driven by infant formula market share gains, our expanding children's business and U.S. retailer inventory increases. Advertising and promotion expenses were lower than the prior year quarter in which the Enfagrow advertising campaign was launched. EBIT for the segment totaled $90.1 million, up from $62.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.

The Latin America segment sales of $207.8 million were down four percent from $215.8 million in the same period a year ago. Constant dollar sales increased 14 percent; 11 percent from price and three percent from volume. Foreign exchange adversely impacted sales growth by 18 percent, primarily in Venezuela and Argentina. In these two markets, price increases were not sufficient to fully offset the impact of currency depreciation. Gross margin and EBIT were negatively impacted by higher input costs and foreign exchange. EBIT for the segment totaled $46.4 million, down from $50.1 million for the same quarter a year ago. 

The Asia segment sales of $548.6 million were up one percent from $544.2 million in the prior year quarter. Constant dollar sales increased three percent; five percent from price offset by a two percent decline in volume. Foreign exchange adversely impacted sales growth by two percent. Trade inventory levels in China were intentionally tightened in the third and early fourth quarters in advance of a later 2014 product re-launch. The segment’s revenue growth was further impacted by a tough comparison to the prior year, when the company benefited from competitors’ supply disruptions. Gross margin and operating expenses were lower than the prior year period due primarily to foreign exchange. EBIT for the segment totaled $195.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, up from $183.0 million for the same quarter a year ago.

Corporate and Other expenses were $122.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, up from $91.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 of which $25.3 million was due to MTM losses.

Full-Year Company Results

Sales were $4,409.3 million in 2014, up five percent from $4,200.7 million a year ago. Constant dollar sales increased nine percent; five percent from price and four percent from volume. Foreign exchange adversely impacted sales growth by four percent. Price increases in Venezuela and Argentina accounted for two percent of total company constant dollar sales growth. Volume growth was significant in North America/Europe and Latin America. The gross margin percentage was lower than the prior year due to higher dairy costs and adverse foreign exchange impacts. EBIT was further impacted by MTM losses totaling $56.9 million. EBIT totaled $988.3 million, up from $974.9 million in 2013.

The effective tax rate for 2014 was 21.5 percent, compared to 25.4 percent a year ago. The ETR improvement was driven by a favorable geographic earnings mix, the absence of the non-deductible prior year administrative penalty in China, and running of the statute of limitations for certain tax contingencies in various jurisdictions. 

For 2014, GAAP and non-GAAP EPS increased five percent and seven percent, respectively, compared to 2013. GAAP net earnings attributable to shareholders for 2014 totaled $719.8 million, or $3.54 per diluted share, up from $683.8 million, or $3.36 per diluted share, in 2013. On a non-GAAP basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders for 2014 totaled $759.4 million, or $3.74 per diluted share, up from $714.7 million, or $3.51 per diluted share, in 2013. 

Full-Year Segment Results

The North America/Europe segment sales of $1,263.4 million in 2014 were up nine percent from $1,160.0 million in 2013. Constant dollar sales increased 10 percent; seven percent from volume and three percent from price. Foreign exchange adversely affected sales growth by one percent. Growth was mainly driven by infant formula market share gains and the expanding children’s nutrition business. EBIT for the segment totaled $291.0 million in 2014, up from $255.0 million in 2013. 

The Latin America segment sales for 2014 of $867.5 million increased one percent from $861.4 million in 2013. Constant dollar sales increased 16 percent; 10 percent from price and six percent from volume. Foreign exchange adversely impacted sales growth by 15 percent, primarily in Venezuela and Argentina. In these two markets, price increases were not sufficient to fully offset the impact of currency depreciation. Gross margin and EBIT were negatively impacted by both currency movements and high dairy costs. EBIT for the segment totaled $199.0 million in 2014, compared to $207.2 million in the prior year.

The Asia segment sales for 2014 of $2,278.4 million were up five percent from $2,179.3 million in 2013. Constant dollar sales increased seven percent; five percent from price and two percent from volume. Foreign exchange adversely impacted sales growth by two percent. The Asia business experienced slower growth in the second half of 2014. Trade inventory levels in China were intentionally tightened in the second half of the year in advance of a later 2014 product re-launch. The segment’s revenue growth was further impacted by a tough comparison to the prior year, when the company benefited from competitors’ supply disruptions. Higher dairy costs and start-up expenses associated with the Singapore facility negatively impacted gross margin. EBIT for the segment totaled $818.7 million for the full year of 2014, up from $796.2 million in 2013.

Page 3 of 12

Corporate and Other expenses for 2014 were $320.4 million, up from $283.5 million in 2013. The increase in expense was mainly due to MTM losses in 2014 compared to gains in 2013. Such losses were driven by updated actuarial assumptions. These expenses were partially offset by the absence of the 2013 administrative penalty in China.

Outlook for 2015 

“We look forward to continued success in 2015 and expect constant dollar revenue growth around seven percent,” Mr. Jakobsen said. “As we enter 2015, we face significant headwinds from a strengthening dollar. Approximately three quarters of our revenue is in foreign currencies while much of our cost base is dollar denominated. As a result, our earnings are somewhat exposed to currency fluctuations. Lower commodity costs will, however, allow us to improve gross margins and invest incrementally behind our brands. We expect 2015 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.00.” 

The company expects reported sales growth to be approximately three percent, which includes adverse foreign exchange of four percent. Specified Items are currently expected to be $0.05 per diluted share excluding any MTM adjustments. As a result, full year GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95.
