Selected Financial Information

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SAN FRANCISCO – Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported diluted earnings per common share of $4.10 for 2014, up 5 percent from $3.89 in 2013. Full year net income was $23.1 billion, compared with $21.9 billion in 2013. For fourth quarter 2014, net income was $5.7 billion, or $1.02 per share, compared with $5.6 billion, or $1.00 per share, for fourth quarter 2013.

"Wells Fargo had another strong year in 2014, with continued strength in the fundamental drivers of long-term performance: growing customers, loans, deposits and capital," said Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. "As a result of this performance, we were able to return more capital to our shareholders during the year. Our success is the result of our 265,000 team members remaining focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers in the communities we serve. As the U.S. economy continues to build momentum, I'm optimistic that our diversified business model will continue to benefit all of our stakeholders in 2015.”

Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said, “Our performance in the fourth quarter was a great example of the benefit of our diversified business model and reflected a continuation of the solid results we generated all year. Compared with the prior quarter, we increased deposits and grew commercial and consumer loans while maintaining our risk and pricing discipline. Revenue increased as net interest income benefited from loan growth and the prudent deployment of our liquidity. Fee income remained strong and diversified. Credit quality continued to improve. We also maintained strong capital and liquidity, and returned more capital to shareholders in the quarter."

Revenue

Revenue was $21.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $21.2 billion in third quarter 2014, driven by an increase in net interest income. Revenue sources remained balanced between spread and fee income and the sources of fee income were broad-based.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income in fourth quarter 2014 increased $239 million on a linked-quarter basis to $11.2 billion. The increase resulted primarily from loan growth, an increase in investment securities, higher trading assets and slightly higher income from variable sources, including purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loan resolutions and periodic dividends. This was partially offset by lower income from a reduction in loans held-for-sale and mortgages held-for-sale.

Net interest margin was 3.04 percent, down 2 basis points from third quarter 2014, predominantly due to an increase in the average balance of cash and short-term investments driven by strong customer deposit growth and higher average balances in liquidity-related funding. While the growth in these two categories had minimal impact to net interest income, the increased deposit balances diluted net interest margin by approximately 4 basis points and the liquidity actions diluted the margin by 2 basis points. The net impact of all other balance sheet growth and repricing resulted in 3 basis points of benefit linked quarter due to a larger loan and investment portfolio. Higher interest income from variable sources benefited net interest margin by 1 basis point.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $10.3 billion. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was stable as increases in trust and investment fees, card fees, and other income, which included a $217 million gain related to the sale of an $8.3 billion portfolio of government guaranteed student loans, were offset by lower deposit service charges, mortgage banking fees, and market sensitive revenue5, primarily equity gains. 

Trust and investment fees were $3.7 billion, up $151 million from third quarter on higher investment banking revenue, including higher loan syndication fees, high-yield debt origination fees and equity underwriting. 

Mortgage banking noninterest income was $1.5 billion, down $118 million from third quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage originations in the fourth quarter. Residential mortgage originations were $44 billion in the fourth quarter, down $4 billion linked quarter, due to the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market. The gain on sale margin was 1.80 percent, compared with 1.82 percent in third quarter. 

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense of $12.6 billion increased $399 million from third quarter 2014. This increase reflected higher personnel costs, including expenses related to fourth quarter revenue, continued investment in our risk infrastructure and some typically elevated fourth quarter costs. Compared with third quarter, deferred compensation expense was $128 million higher (offset in revenue) due to changes in market levels. Additionally, revenue-driven incentive compensation increased $77 million from the prior quarter. Fourth quarter 

- 4 -

expenses included typically higher outside professional services, which increased $116 million, equipment (up $124 million) and advertising and promotion (up $42 million). Operating losses were $108 million lower in fourth quarter, driven by lower litigation accruals in the quarter. The efficiency ratio for full year 2014 was 58.1 percent, and the Company expects to operate within its targeted efficiency ratio range of 55 to 59 percent for full year 2015.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 30.6 percent for fourth quarter 2014, compared with 31.6 percent for third quarter 2014. The lower effective tax rate in fourth quarter 2014 was due primarily to the passage of federal tax legislation renewing certain tax benefits and from the resolution of prior period matters with federal and state taxing authorities.

Loans

Total loans were $862.6 billion at December 31, 2014, up $23.7 billion from September 30, 2014, reflecting broad-based growth in our portfolios. Core loan growth was $26.0 billion, and our non-strategic/liquidating portfolios declined $2.3 billion in the quarter. Loan growth included the acquisition of the Dillard's credit card portfolio as well as $6.5 billion from the financing related to the sale of government guaranteed student loans.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)See table on page 35 for additional information on non-strategic/liquidating loan portfolios. Management believes that the above information provides useful disclosure regarding the Company’s ongoing loan portfolios.

Investment Securities

Investment securities were $312.9 billion at December 31, 2014, up $23.9 billion from third quarter. Purchases of approximately $35 billion, primarily U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities, were partially offset by run-off and maturities.

The Company had net unrealized available-for-sale securities gains of $7.8 billion at December 31, 2014, up from $6.6 billion at September 30, 2014, primarily driven by marketable equity securities.

Deposits

Average total deposits for fourth quarter 2014 were $1.1 trillion, up 8 percent from a year ago and up 8 percent (annualized) from third quarter 2014, driven by both commercial and consumer growth. The average deposit cost for fourth quarter 2014 was 9 basis points, an improvement of 1 basis point from the prior quarter and 2 basis points from a year ago. Average core deposits were $1.0 trillion, up 7 percent from a year ago and up 9 percent (annualized) from third quarter 2014. Average mortgage escrow deposits were $29.2 billion, compared with $28.2 billion a year ago and $30.7 billion in third quarter 2014.

- 5 -

Capital

Capital levels continued to be strong in the fourth quarter, with Common Equity Tier 1 of $137.2 billion under Basel III (General Approach), or 11.04 percent of risk-weighted assets. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (Advanced Approach, fully phased-in) was 10.44 percent4. In fourth quarter 2014, the Company purchased 61.6 million shares of its common stock and entered into a $750 million forward repurchase transaction for an additional estimated 14.3 million shares which is expected to settle in first quarter 2015. The Company also paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.35 per share, up from $0.30 per share a year ago.

(a)December 31, 2014, ratios are preliminary.

(b)See tables on page 38 for more information on Common Equity Tier 1.

Credit Quality

“Credit losses were 0.35 percent of average loans in 2014 and remained near historic lows. In the fourth quarter, loan losses remained low, nonperforming assets decreased, and delinquency rates were stable compared with the prior quarter, and we continued to grow the portfolio with high quality loans,” said Chief Risk Officer Mike Loughlin. “Credit losses were $735 million in fourth quarter 2014, compared with $963 million in fourth quarter 2013, a 24 percent improvement. The quarterly loss rate (annualized) was 0.34 percent with commercial losses of 0.03 percent and consumer losses of 0.63 percent. Nonperforming assets declined by $739 million, or 18 percent (annualized), from the prior quarter. We released $250 million from the allowance for credit losses in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued credit quality improvement. Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions."

- 6 -

Net Loan Charge-offs

Net loan charge-offs were $735 million in fourth quarter 2014, or 0.34 percent (annualized) of average loans, compared with $668 million in third quarter 2014, or 0.32 percent (annualized) of average loans.

Net Loan Charge-Offs

(a)Quarterly net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans are annualized. See explanation on page 32 of the accounting for purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans and the impact on selected financial ratios.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets decreased by $739 million from third quarter to $15.5 billion. Nonaccrual loans decreased $517 million to $12.8 billion. Foreclosed assets were $2.6 billion, down from $2.8 billion in third quarter 2014 on lower government insured/guaranteed and commercial balances.

Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)During fourth quarter 2014, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-14, Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans Upon Foreclosure, effective as of January 1, 2014. This ASU requires that government guaranteed real estate mortgage loans that meet specific criteria be recognized as other receivables upon foreclosure; previously, these assets were included in foreclosed assets. Government guaranteed residential real estate mortgage loans that completed foreclosure during 2014 and met the criteria specified by ASU 2014-14 are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets.

Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing (excluding government insured/guaranteed) totaled $920 million at December 31, 2014, compared with $946 million at September 30, 2014. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing with repayments insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or predominantly guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for mortgages and the U.S. Department of Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program were $16.9 billion at December 31, 2014, down from $17.3 billion at September 30, 2014.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $13.2 billion at December 31, 2014, down from $13.5 billion at September 30, 2014. The allowance coverage to total loans was 1.53 percent, compared with 1.61 percent in third quarter 2014. The allowance covered 4.5 times annualized fourth quarter net charge-offs, compared with 5.1 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage to nonaccrual loans was 103 percent at December 31, 2014, compared with 101 percent at September 30, 2014. “We believe the allowance was appropriate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2014,” said Loughlin.

Selected Financial Information

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Community Banking reported net income of $3.4 billion, down $35 million, or 1 percent, from third quarter 2014. Revenue of $12.8 billion was up slightly as higher net interest income, credit card fees, gains on deferred compensation plan investments (offset in employee benefits expense), and a gain on sale of government guaranteed student loans were largely offset by lower market sensitive revenue, mainly lower gains on sale of debt securities and equity investments. Noninterest expense increased $230 million, or 3 percent, from the prior quarter due to higher equipment expense, project spending, and deferred compensation plan expense (offset in trading revenue), partially offset by lower operating losses. The provision for credit losses increased $53 million from the prior quarter.

Net income was up $213 million, or 7 percent, from fourth quarter 2013. Revenue increased $581 million, or 5 percent, from a year ago primarily due to higher net interest income, trust and investment fees, revenue from debit and credit card volumes, gains on sale of debt securities, and a gain on sale of government guaranteed student loans, partially offset by lower gains on equity investments. Noninterest expense increased $208 million, or 3 percent, from a year ago driven by higher personnel expenses and operating losses, partially offset by lower FDIC expense. The provision for credit losses increased $28 million from a year ago as the $232 million improvement in net charge-offs was more than offset by a lower reserve release.

Accordingly, we revised our commercial loan balances for year-end 2012 and each of the quarters in 2013 in order to present the Company’s lending trends on a comparable basis over this period. This revision, which resulted in a reduction to total commercial loans and a corresponding decrease to other liabilities, did not impact the Company’s consolidated net income or total cash flows. We reduced our commercial loans by $3.5 billion, $3.2 billion, $2.1 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.2 billion at December 31, September 30, June 30, and March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively, which represented less than 1% of total commercial loans and less than 0.5% of our total loan portfolio. Other affected financial information, including financial guarantees and financial ratios, has been appropriately revised to reflect this revision.

(2)The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).

(3)Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.

(4)Core deposits are noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking, savings certificates, certain market rate and other savings, and certain foreign deposits (Eurodollar sweep balances).

(5)Retail core deposits are total core deposits excluding Wholesale Banking core deposits and retail mortgage escrow deposits.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS

Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired. PCI loans predominantly represent loans acquired from Wachovia that were deemed to be credit impaired. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, recent borrower credit scores and recent LTV percentages. PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the associated allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date.

Under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Accordingly, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual and they are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized under accounting for PCI loans and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.

Subsequent to acquisition, we regularly evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued usage of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. If we have probable decreases in the expected cash flows (other than due to decreases in interest rate indices and changes in prepayment assumptions), we charge the provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If we have probable and significant increases in the expected cash flows subsequent to establishing an additional allowance, we first reverse any previously established allowance and then increase interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans.

As a result of PCI loan accounting, certain credit-related ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.

Substantially all of our PCI loans were acquired from Wachovia on December 31, 2008, at which time we acquired $18.7 billion of commercial and $40.1 billion of consumer PCI loans. The following table provides information for PCI loans by loan class.

CHANGES IN NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR PCI LOANS

The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. A nonaccretable difference is established in purchase accounting for PCI loans to absorb losses expected at that time on those loans. Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. Substantially all our commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Resolutions of loans may include sales to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or foreclosure of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an individual loan from a pool based on comparing the amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the nonaccretable difference. This removal method assumes that the amount received from resolution approximates pool performance expectations. The accretable yield percentage is unaffected by the resolution and any changes in the effective yield for the remaining loans in the pool are addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. For loans that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference for the pool because there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the contractual amount of the loan. Modified PCI loans are not removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Modified PCI loans that are accounted for individually are considered TDRs, and removed from PCI accounting, if there has been a concession granted in excess of the original nonaccretable difference. The following table provides an analysis of changes in the nonaccretable difference.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Release of the nonaccretable difference for settlement with borrower, on individually accounted PCI loans, increases interest income in the period of settlement. Pick-a-Pay and Other consumer PCI loans do not reflect nonaccretable difference releases for settlements with borrowers due to pool accounting for those loans, which assumes that the amount received approximates the pool performance expectations.

(2)Release of the nonaccretable difference as a result of sales to third parties increases noninterest income in the period of the sale.

(3)Reclassification of nonaccretable difference to accretable yield will result in increased interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans.

(4)Write-downs to net realizable value of PCI loans are absorbed by the nonaccretable difference when severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower financial stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan. Also includes foreign exchange adjustments related to underlying principal for which the nonaccretable difference was established.

CHANGES IN ACCRETABLE YIELD RELATED TO PCI LOANS

The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated lives of the PCI loans using the effective yield method. The accretable yield is affected by:

•Changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans – Expected future cash flows are based on the variable rates in effect at the time of the quarterly assessment of expected cash flows;

•Changes in prepayment assumptions – Prepayments affect the estimated life of PCI loans which may change the amount of interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be collected; and

•Changes in the expected principal and interest payments over the estimated life – Updates to changes in expected cash flows are driven by the credit outlook and actions taken with borrowers. Changes in expected future cash flows from loan modifications are included in the regular evaluations of cash flows expected to be collected.

The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans is presented in the following table.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes accretable yield released as a result of settlements with borrowers, which is included in interest income.

(2)Includes accretable yield released as a result of sales to third parties, which is included in noninterest income.

(3)Represents changes in cash flows expected to be collected due to the impact of modifications, changes in prepayment assumptions, changes in interest rates on variable rate PCI loans and sales to third parties.

CHANGES IN ALLOWANCE FOR PCI LOAN LOSSES

When it is estimated that the expected cash flows have decreased subsequent to acquisition for a PCI loan or pool of loans, an allowance is established and a provision for additional loss is recorded as a charge to income. The following table summarizes the changes in allowance for PCI loan losses.

(2)Adjusted unpaid principal balance includes write-downs taken on loans where severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower financial stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan.

(3)The current LTV ratio is calculated as the adjusted unpaid principal balance divided by the collateral value. Collateral values are generally determined using automated valuation models (AVM) and are updated quarterly. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate market values of homes based on processing large volumes of market data including market comparables and price trends for local market areas.

(4)Carrying value, which does not reflect the allowance for loan losses, includes remaining purchase accounting adjustments, which, for PCI loans may include the nonaccretable difference and the accretable yield and, for all other loans, an adjustment to mark the loans to a market yield at date of merger less any subsequent charge-offs.

(5)The ratio of carrying value to current value is calculated as the carrying value divided by the collateral value.

FIVE QUARTER RISK-BASED CAPITAL COMPONENTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Basel III revises the definition of capital, increases minimum capital ratios, and introduces a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. These changes are being fully phased in effective January 1, 2014 through the end of 2021 and the capital ratios will be determined using Basel III (General Approach) RWAs during 2014.

(2)Under transition provisions to Basel III, cumulative other comprehensive income (previously deducted under Basel I) is included in CET1 over a specified phase-in period. In addition, certain intangible assets includable in CET1 are phased out over a specified period.

(3)Goodwill and other intangible assets are net of any associated deferred tax liabilities.

(4)CET1 (formerly Tier 1 common equity under Basel I) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. Management reviews CET1 along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analyses and has included this non-GAAP financial information, and the corresponding reconciliation to total equity, because of current interest in such information on the part of market participants.

(5)Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs.

COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 UNDER BASEL III (ADVANCED APPROACH, FULLY PHASED-IN) (1)(2) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)CET1 is a non-GAAP financial measure that is used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. Management reviews CET1 along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analyses and has included this non-GAAP financial information, and the corresponding reconciliation to total equity, because of current interest in such information on the part of market participants.

(2)The Basel III CET1 and RWAs are estimated based on the Basel III capital rules adopted July 2, 2013, by the FRB. The rules establish a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that implement the Basel III capital framework and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules are being phased in effective January 1, 2014 through the end of 2021.

(3)Assumes cumulative other comprehensive income is fully phased in and certain other intangible assets are fully phased out under Basel III capital rules.

(4)The final Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks: the Standardized Approach intended to replace Basel I, and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions. Under the final rules, we will be subject to the lower of our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy. While the amount of RWAs determined under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches has been converging, management’s estimate of RWAs as of December 31, 2014, is based on the Advanced Approach, which is currently estimated to be higher than RWAs under the Standardized Approach, resulting in a lower CET1 compared with the Standardized Approach. Basel III capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve Board incorporate different classification of assets, with risk weights based on Wells Fargo’s internal models, along with adjustments to address a combination of credit/counterparty, operational and market risks, and other Basel III elements.

UNRESOLVED REPURCHASE DEMANDS AND MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes repurchase demands of 4 and $1 million, 7 and $1 million, 14 and $3 million, 25 and $3 million, and 42 and $6 million at December 31, September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, received from investors on mortgage servicing rights acquired from other originators. We generally have the right of recourse against the seller and may be able to recover losses related to such repurchase demands subject to counterparty risk associated with the seller.

(2)As part of our representations and warranties in our loan sales contracts, we typically represent to GSEs and private investors that certain loans have mortgage insurance to the extent there are loans that have loan to value ratios in excess of 80% that require mortgage insurance. To the extent the mortgage insurance is rescinded by the mortgage insurer due to a claim of breach of a contractual representation or warranty, the lack of insurance may result in a repurchase demand from an investor. Similar to repurchase demands, we evaluate mortgage insurance rescission notices for validity and appeal for reinstatement if the rescission was not based on a contractual breach. When investor demands are received due to lack of mortgage insurance, they are reported as unresolved repurchase demands based on the applicable investor category for the loan (GSE or private).

(3)While the original loan balances related to these demands are presented above, the establishment of the repurchase liability is based on a combination of factors, such as our appeals success rates, reimbursement by correspondent and other third party originators, and projected loss severity, which is driven by the difference between the current loan balance and the estimated collateral value less costs to sell the property.
