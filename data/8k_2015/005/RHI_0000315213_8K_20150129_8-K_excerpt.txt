Item 2.02Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On January 29, 2015, Robert Half International Inc. issued a press release reporting earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

The foregoing information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being “furnished” and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such future filing.

Item 8.01Other Events.

On January 23, 2015, Plaintiff April Washington, on her own behalf and on behalf of two separate putative subclasses, filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of California, San Mateo County. The complaint alleges that the Company violated the disclosure requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”) by: (i) procuring background checks on Plaintiff and other putative class members for employment purposes without first making all required disclosures in a standalone document; and (ii) procuring drug tests on Plaintiff and other putative class members for employment purposes without first making all required disclosures in a standalone document. Washington seeks recovery on her own behalf and on behalf of the putative subclasses in an unspecified amount for statutory damages of not less than $100 and not more than $1000 for each class member, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, and costs. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this proceeding and, accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the Company’s Financial Statements. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations and the Company intends to vigorously defend against the litigation.
