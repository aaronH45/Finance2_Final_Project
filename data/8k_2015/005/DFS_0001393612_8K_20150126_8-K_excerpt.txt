Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On January 26, 2015, each of the executives of Discover Financial Services (the “Company”) listed in the table below adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan (“Plan”) providing for the sale of previously issued shares of common stock of the Company. None of the executives has previously sold securities under a pre-arranged trading plan at the Company.  

Sales of shares under the Plans are intended to help diversify the personal investment holdings of the executives and are expected to occur on a monthly basis for one year beginning in May 2015, subject to a minimum price threshold. Each executive currently holds shares of common stock of the Company well in excess of the Company’s executive stock ownership guidelines, which require the executives to hold shares equivalent to a certain number of times their base salaries. As set forth below, assuming all shares under each Plan are sold, each executive’s holdings would continue to remain well in excess of these guidelines.  

The Plans were established under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Company’s policies regarding transactions by Company executives in the Company’s securities. The executives retain no discretion over purchases or sales under the Plans, and the transactions are executed through brokers on or after specified dates. Amendments or modifications to the Plans are not permitted. The transactions will be disclosed publicly in Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
