   •   Reports first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.53.

Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 5, 2015) – BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $2.051 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of 1.8 percent from the prior-year period, or 5.3 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.  

“We are off to a really good start this fiscal year,” said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chairman, CEO and President. “Both segments contributed to revenue growth, aided by flu-related sales. Our revenue growth and good operating performance this quarter gives us the confidence to raise guidance for fiscal year 2015.”  

First Quarter Earnings  

Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.53, compared with $1.43 in the prior-year period. This represents an increase of 7.0 percent, or 15.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Current and prior-year results were impacted by certain specified items, which are detailed in the accompanying reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. On a reported basis, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.20, compared with $1.37 in the prior-year period. This represents a decline of 12.4 percent from the prior-year period, or a decline of 3.6 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis.  

Segment Results  

In the BD Medical segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.072 billion, representing an increase of 0.8 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 4.2 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment’s revenue growth reflects strong sales in the Medical Surgical Systems unit. Segment results were unfavorably impacted by ordering patterns in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit, as expected. Revenues in Diabetes Care were impacted, in part, by a timing of orders and an unfavorable comparison to the prior-year.  

In the BD Life Sciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $979 million, representing an increase of 3.0 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 6.5 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. The segment’s growth was driven by strong sales across all three business units: Preanalytical Systems, Diagnostic Systems and Biosciences. Diagnostic Systems growth was aided, in part, by a stronger than expected flu season, as compared to the prior-year.  

Geographic Results  

First quarter revenues in the U.S. of $881 million represent an increase of 3.7 percent over the prior-year period. Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.170 billion, representing an increase of 0.4 percent compared with the prior-year period, or an increase of 6.4 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. International revenues reflected continued strength in emerging markets and sales of safety-engineered products.  

Fiscal 2015 Outlook for Full Year  

The Company estimates that revenues for the full fiscal year 2015 will increase approximately 5.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis, which is an increase from previously issued guidance of 4.5 to 5 percent. On a reported basis, revenues are expected to be about flat to a decline of 1.0 percent, due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.  

The Company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow 9.0 to 10.0 percent on a foreign currency-neutral basis. This is an increase from previously issued guidance of 8.0 to 9.0 percent. Including the estimated unfavorable impact of foreign-currency, adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $6.50 and $6.57. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full fiscal year 2014 were $6.50. The Company expects full fiscal year reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $5.98 to $6.05.  

Guidance estimates provided are for the Company on a stand-alone basis. Guidance inclusive of the CareFusion acquisition will be provided after the close of the transaction. As a reminder, the Company has moved to “Cash EPS”; adjusted earnings per share values exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
