[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Achieves adjusted quarterly diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.01, excluding discrete tax benefits; this result includes $0.17 in restructuring and other costs

•Plans to divest two businesses, which are now reported as discontinued operations

•Updates guidance for 2015 full year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.95, a reduction to prior guidance reflecting the combined impact of global energy markets and discontinued operations, net of share repurchase activity 

Downers Grove, Illinois, January 27, 2015 — Dover (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014, revenue was $2.0 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year. The revenue increase was driven by organic growth of 6% and an increase of 7% from acquisitions, partially offset by a 2% impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations were $171.8 million, essentially flat compared to $172.2 million for the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014 was $1.03, compared to $1.00 EPS in the prior year period, representing an increase of 3%. EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2014 included discrete tax benefits of $0.02, compared to $0.01 EPS in the prior year period. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.01, an increase of 2% over an adjusted EPS of $0.99 in the prior year period. 

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $7.8 billion, an increase of 8% over the prior year, reflecting organic growth of 4% and a 4% increase from acquisitions. Foreign exchange had a negligible impact. Earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $778.1 million, compared to $797.5 million in the prior year period, representing a decrease of 2%. EPS for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $4.61 EPS, essentially flat compared to $4.60 EPS in the prior year. EPS from continuing operations during this period includes discrete tax benefits of $0.07 EPS compared to $0.43 EPS in the prior year, as well as $0.02 of other one-time gains recognized in the prior year. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $4.54, an increase of 10% over an adjusted EPS of $4.14 in the prior year.

Dover also announced today its intention to divest Sargent Aerospace (“Sargent”), a supplier of precision-engineered components and aftermarket services in the aerospace and defense industries, and part of Dover’s Engineered Systems segment. Both Sargent and Datamax O’Neil (“D-O”) are reported as discontinued operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. 

Dover expects to complete the sale of D-O in the first quarter, with the sale of Sargent expected to occur in the second quarter of 2015.

Commenting on the fourth quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, “We finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving 11% revenue growth and earnings growth that exceeded expectations. We saw robust topline growth at each segment led by Energy and Fluids at 20% and 10%, respectively, and achieved solid volume leverage. In the quarter, we made the decision to divest Sargent and, as previously announced, Datamax O’Neil. While both are excellent companies with strong positions, they serve markets where others have greater scale. We expect after-tax proceeds of the divestitures to be used for share repurchases and growth opportunities."

“As previously announced, we took decisive actions in the quarter to adjust our costs and streamline our businesses, which accounted for the majority of nonrecurring charges of $0.17. Regarding our energy markets, there continues to be significant uncertainty driven by the rapid decline in oil prices. Accordingly, we took additional cost reduction steps in our Energy businesses during the quarter and continue to review further actions, including additional restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2015."

"As a result, we are updating our 2015 guidance to reflect the anticipated combined impact of lower oil prices, discontinued operations, share repurchase activity and FX. We now expect total revenue growth of 1% to -2%, principally reflecting our new Energy revenue estimate of -6% to -9%, a 15 point reduction from our prior forecast. Within our total revenue forecast, organic growth is anticipated to be approximately 1% to -2%, completed acquisitions will provide approximately 2% growth and FX is expected to be a 2% headwind. In total, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.95, a $0.35 reduction to our prior guidance.”

Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, were $169.3 million, or $1.02 EPS, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $2.5 million, or $0.02 EPS compared to net earnings of $194.0 million, or $1.13 EPS, for the same period of 2013, which included earnings from discontinued operations of $21.7 million, or $0.13 EPS. 

Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $775.2 million, or $4.59 EPS, compared to net earnings of $1.0 billion, or $5.78 EPS, for the same period of 2013. 2014 results reflected a loss from discontinued operations of $2.9 million, or $0.02 EPS, which included $27.1 million in spin-off costs. 2013 results reflected earnings from discontinued operations of $205.6 million or $1.18 EPS, which included spin-off costs of $30.1 million.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2014

Acquisitions

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company completed one acquisition within the Energy segment. For the full year 2014, Dover made a total of seven acquisitions for consideration totaling $802.3 million. 

Discontinued Operations

The Company did not dispose of any businesses in the fourth quarter of 2014; however, in the fourth quarter, the Company announced its intent to divest Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace, two non-core businesses within the Engineered Systems segment. The results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have been reclassified to discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been segregated within assets and liabilities of discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. For the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company recognized a loss from discontinued operations of $2.5 million, or $0.02 EPS, which includes $6.0 million of earnings, or $0.04 EPS, of the aforementioned businesses.

On a full-year basis, the Company generated a net loss of $2.9 million, or $0.02 EPS. Included in this amount is a $6.9 million loss on sale of DEK International, which was sold in the third quarter of 2014 and a $3.2 million gain to adjust the gain on sale of Everett Charles Technologies, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2013. Also included in the results of discontinued operations is $26.3 million of earnings, or $0.16 EPS, attributable to the operations of Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace. Earnings from discontinued operations also include the results of Knowles Corporation, prior to the distribution on February 28, 2014, as well as the related spin-off costs incurred by Dover during the period, which totaled a loss of approximately $21.8 million, or $0.13 EPS. 

Restructuring and Other Costs

During the quarter, the Company took actions to adjust our costs and streamline our businesses, resulting in $37.4 million, or $0.16 EPS, of restructuring charges. These charges were incurred at each of our business segments, including $5.8 million in Energy, $3.7 million in Engineered Systems, $2.8 million in Fluids, and $24.9 million in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The Company expects to record an additional $17 to $20 million in restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2015, with the majority of these charges in the Energy segment. The Company also recorded a $3.6 million, or $0.01 EPS, pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 25.6% and 28.5% for the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, respectively. On a full year basis, the effective tax rates on continuing operations for 2014 and 2013 were 28.9% and 23.8%, respectively. The 2014 and 2013 rates were favorably impacted by discrete and other items, as shown in the reconciliation for quarterly earnings per share included herein. After adjusting for discrete and other items, the fourth quarter effective tax rates were 27.3% and 29.5% for 2014 and 2013, respectively, and the full year rates were 29.9% and 31.0% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The lower rates for the quarter and full year primarily reflect the tax benefits associated with restructuring charges and lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. The fourth quarter rate was also favorably impacted by the extension of the R&D credit.

Revenue Growth Factors

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free Cash Flow

The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) from cash flow provided by operating activities: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The full year decrease in 2014 free cash flow reflects a higher investment in working capital year over year, higher capital expenditures, and lower earnings from continuing operations.

Share Repurchases

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company purchased a total of approximately 7.5 million shares of its common stock in the open market at a total cost of $601.1 million, or $80.50 per share. The Company completed its November 2012 $1.0 billion stock repurchase program in 2014 through the repurchase of 3.6 million shares. The remaining 3.9 million of share repurchases in 2014 were made pursuant to the share repurchase program approved in May 2012. As of December 31, 2014, the approximate number of shares still available for repurchase under the May 2012 share repurchase authorization was 38,041. 

Capitalization 

The following table provides a summary reconciliation of total debt and net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP Information: 

These Investor Supplement tables contain non-GAAP measures such as revenue including Sargent Aerospace and Datamax O'Neil and earnings including Sargent Aerospace and Datamax O'Neil, which is used in calculating earnings per share attributable to Sargent Aerospace and Datamax O'Neil. These tables also contain non-GAAP measures of adjusted earnings from continuing operations used in calculating adjusted diluted earnings per common share. Management believes this information is useful to investors to better understand the company’s ongoing profitability and facilitates easier comparisons of the company’s profitability to prior and future periods and to its peers. The company has also disclosed herein a number of non-GAAP measures related to free cash flow and the ratio of net debt to net capitalization. Management believes these metrics are important measures of the company's operating performance and liquidity. Free cash flow information provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase common stock, while the net debt to net capitalization ratio is helpful in evaluating the company's capital structure and the amount of leverage employed.
