Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On February 23, 2015, Alliant Energy Corporation (Alliant Energy) issued a press release announcing its earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. A copy of such press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

Alliant Energy included in the press release 2013 income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations excluding a regulatory-related credit at Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) related to its Whispering Willow - East wind project due to a December 2013 Minnesota Public Utilities Commission order and charges associated with preferred stock redemptions at IPL and Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL). Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures (financial measures not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) are useful to investors because they provide an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy’s management also uses income from continuing operations, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation.

In addition, Alliant Energy included in the press release 2014 and 2013 IPL, WPL, Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., and non-regulated and parent earnings per share from continuing operations. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends and provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy’s management also uses utility and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. earnings per share from continuing operations to determine performance-based compensation.
