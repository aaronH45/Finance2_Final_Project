Item 8.01. Other Events. 

On January 5, 2015, Ventas, Inc. (the “Company”) announced that its Board of Directors has declared a prorated dividend on the Company’s common stock, conditioned upon the completion of its pending acquisition of American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust, Inc.

The dividend will be payable in cash to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective (the “Effective Time”).
