ATLANTA, February 5, 2015 - Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE), the leading global network of exchanges and clearing houses, today reported record financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. For the quarter ended December 31, 2014, consolidated net income attributable to ICE was $288 million on $800 million consolidated revenues less transaction-based expenses. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the fourth quarter were $2.54 and for the full year 2014 were $8.55. 

ICE’s operating results include amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition and integration related expenses, gain on our Euronext sale and our share of OCC’s full year income that are not reflective of ICE’s cash operations and core business performance. Excluding these items, net of tax, fourth quarter 2014 adjusted income from continuing operations was $294 million and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations were $2.59, an increase of 30% year over year. Please refer to the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release for more information on adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. 

“By focusing on the requirements of our customers and delivering on our integration milestones, we achieved record results in 2014,” said ICE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher. “We strengthened our leadership position in growth markets, including global oil, natural gas and swaps clearing. During the year we also separated Euronext, seamlessly transitioned Liffe’s markets to our exchanges and accelerated our synergy realization. We grew revenues at the New York Stock Exchange, increased market share in trading and again led in global capital raising with 129 initial public offerings. We remain focused on delivering growth and solid returns to our investors by putting the needs of our customers first.” 

“Our strong cash generation and balance sheet enabled us to pursue strategic growth initiatives this year while returning nearly $1 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks,” said ICE CFO, Scott A. Hill. “We recorded our 18th record year in Brent volume and earned nearly $100 million in CDS clearing revenues. We continued to expand our leadership in clearing through product innovation and strategic acquisitions. At the same time, we completed nearly $290 million, or over 50%, of our synergy target by the end of 2014. The strong momentum we have established entering 2015 coupled with continued execution of our strategic initiatives and further expense reductions during 2015 support our target of once again delivering double digit earnings growth, strong cash generation and meaningful capital returns.”
