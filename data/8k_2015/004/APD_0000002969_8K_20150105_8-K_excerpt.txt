Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure  

As previously announced on September 18, 2014, the Company began operating under a new structure effective October 1, 2014 and in January 2015 will report results under its seven new segments for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015.  

The new segments are:  

   •    Industrial Gases—Americas  

   •    Industrial Gases—EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa)  

   •    Industrial Gases—Asia  

   •    Industrial Gases—Global  

   •    Materials Technologies  

   •    Energy-from-Waste  

   •    Corporate  

Each of the three regional Industrial Gases segments (Americas, EMEA, Asia) includes, with respect to such region, all onsite Air Separation Units (ASUs producing primarily oxygen, nitrogen and argon), Hydrogen/HyCO Plants (producing primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide, syngas and steam), and the regional Merchant Gases businesses (including liquid/bulk, packaged gases and related equipment). The Industrial Gases - Global segment includes atmospheric sale of equipment (SOE) businesses, such as ASUs and noncryogenic generators, as well as global resources associated with the Industrial Gases business. The Materials Technologies segment includes the Electronics Materials and Performance Materials businesses, but excludes the previous Electronics tonnage gases business which is now part of the three regional Industrial Gases segments. The Energy-from-Waste segment includes the Tees Valley projects in the U.K. The Corporate segment includes two on-going global businesses (LNG and Helium containers SOE), the polyurethane intermediates business that was exited in early fiscal year 2014, and corporate supporting functions that benefit all of the business segments. Supporting functions that support a specific business are allocated directly to the related segment.  

The Company is issuing this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide historical financial information to investors that is comparable to the format in which results will be presented for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. The schedules in Exhibit 99.1 include unaudited quarterly consolidated and segment information for fiscal years 2014 and 2013. The information provided excludes the impacts of discontinued operations and is presented on a non-GAAP basis to reflect supplemental financial information our management uses internally to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA by segment is defined as segment operating income plus equity affiliate income, but excludes depreciation and amortization expense. We believe this provides a useful operational metric for the measurement of cash flows generated by each segment.
