CME Group Inc. Reports Fourth-Quarter 2014 and Full-Year Financial Results

•Fourth-quarter revenues rose 22 percent and represented second highest quarterly revenue 

•Fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share increased more than 50 percent 

•Annual overall average daily volume reached a record 13.7 million contracts in 2014, along with annual records in interest rates and options

 CHICAGO, February 5, 2015 — CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CME) today reported revenues of $841 million and operating income of $472 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income attributable to CME Group was $306 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.91. Excluding the items noted in the reconciliation, adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.951.

“During the fourth quarter, we saw a pickup in volatility that helped drive broad-based growth across all our major product offerings,” said CME Group Executive Chairman and President Terry Duffy. “Average daily volume reached nearly 15 million contracts, up more than 30 percent and representing the second highest quarterly volume in our history. This strong performance also reflects the success of our investments to spur organic growth by attracting trading from customers outside the United States. In addition, we have made significant progress with our OTC initiatives, which continue to drive more activity in our core products. As a result, our revenue during the quarter was up more than 20 percent, and earnings per share rose more than 50 percent.”

“We saw significant growth in every product area during the fourth quarter, ranging from 14 percent in metals to 41 percent in interest rates,” said CME Group Chief Executive Officer Phupinder Gill. “Total options rose 38 percent and futures grew 29 percent compared with the same period last year, while electronic options increased more than 50 percent. International volumes also grew by nearly 50 percent, reaching a record 3 million contracts per day in the fourth quarter. We also reached our highest level of open interest ever and broke the record for highest daily volume. Further, we restructured the business during the quarter, positioning ourselves to generate higher margins and earnings going forward.”

Fourth-quarter 2014 average daily volume was 14.8 million contracts, up 31 percent from fourth-quarter 2013, and the highest quarterly average daily volume since the first quarter of 2008. Clearing and transaction fee revenues were $713.0 million, up 24 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2013. Fourth-quarter 2014 total average rate per contract was 73.1 cents, up from 72.5 cents in third-quarter 2014, driven primarily by a higher proportion of total volume coming from commodities products, which have higher average fees.
