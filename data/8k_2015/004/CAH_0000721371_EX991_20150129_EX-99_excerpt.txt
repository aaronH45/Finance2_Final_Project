•Fiscal 2015 outlook for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations raised to $4.28 to $4.38 from prior guidance range of $4.10 to $4.30

DUBLIN, Ohio, Jan. 29, 2015 - Cardinal Health today reported fiscal year 2015 second-quarter revenue of $25.5 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $1.20. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 10 percent to $639 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 grew 33 percent; however, excluding a $0.16 tax charge in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year, the growth rate was 13 percent. On a GAAP basis, operating earnings increased 5 percent to $546 million, and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 9 percent to $0.86. 

“We're pleased to report an excellent second quarter capping off a strong first half to our fiscal year," said George Barrett, chairman and chief executive officer of Cardinal Health. "Overall, we posted strong revenue growth for the second quarter. Although we experienced some continued challenges in the Canadian market, we saw real progress in most of our business lines and customer channels. Most important, our organization continues to drive our key strategic priorities with focus on positioning us to create new value for our customers and patients in a time of great change.”

He continued, "Based on our performance in the first half of our fiscal year and our expectations for the second half, we are raising our guidance for full-year non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to a range of $4.28 to $4.38."

Q2 FY15 SUMMARY

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As previously disclosed, both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations for second quarter of prior fiscal year reflected a tax charge of $56 million, or $0.16 per share, based on proposed assessments of additional tax.

SEGMENT RESULTS

Pharmaceutical Segment

Revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 16 percent to $22.6 billion, due to growth in the base of existing customers as well as the impact of new customers. Segment profit increased 12 percent to $542 million, driven by strong performance under generic programs, which includes the net benefit of Red Oak Sourcing, as well as continued growth from existing customers and growth from new customers.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Medical Segment

Revenue for the Medical segment was up 4 percent to $2.9 billion, driven by acquisitions and growth from existing customers. Segment profit decreased 12 percent to $115 million due to the year-over-year increase in enterprise-wide incentive compensation as well as the continued impact of market pressures in Canada and the related repositioning of that business.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We present non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures, including per share calculations) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. We are unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because we cannot reliably forecast restructuring and employee severance, amortization and other acquisition-related costs, impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, LIFO charges/(credits) and loss on extinguishment of debt, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact our future financial results.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

This earnings release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In general, the measures exclude items and charges that (i) management does not believe reflect Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company") core business and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate activities; or (ii) relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company’s performance, evaluate the balance sheet, engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation.

In fiscal 2015, the Company began excluding last-in, first-out ("LIFO") inventory charges/(credits)5 from its non-GAAP earnings, for consistency with the presentation by some of its peers. The Company did not record any LIFO charges or credits in the first or second quarters of fiscal 2015 or 2014, respectively. In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company has excluded the loss on extinguishment of debt6 related to the early redemption of debt that occurred in December 2014 from its non-GAAP earnings.

Management provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on its financial and operating results and in comparing the Company’s performance to that of its competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth above should be carefully evaluated.
