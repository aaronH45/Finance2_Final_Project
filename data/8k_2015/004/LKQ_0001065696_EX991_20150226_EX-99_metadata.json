        "We provide a reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share ('EPS') to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS as we believe it offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information regarding our results of operations because it assists in analyzing our performance and the value of our business. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS are presented as supplemental measures of our performance that management believes are useful for evaluating and comparing our operating activities across reporting periods. In 2014 and 2013, the Company defines Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS as Net Income and Diluted EPS adjusted to eliminate the impact of restructuring and acquisition related expenses, net of tax, loss on debt extinguishment, net of tax, and the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to Net Income or Diluted EPS as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies."
