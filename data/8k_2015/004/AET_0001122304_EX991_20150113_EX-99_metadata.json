Morgan Healthcare Conference | January 13, 2015 36 Footnotes (continued) (2) Projected full-year 2014 operating revenue excludes from total revenue net realized capital gains of $80.6 million pretax reported by Aetna for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Projected operating revenue also excludes any future net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, from total revenue. Aetna is not able to project the amount of future net realized capital gains or losses or any such other items and therefore cannot reconcile projected operating revenue to projected total revenue in any period. Below is a reconciliation of Aetnaâ€™s operating revenue to total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2010: (Millions) 2013 2010 Operating revenue (excludes net real ized capita l (losses) gains and other i tems) (A) 47,194.7$ 34,024.5$ Group annuity contract convers ion premium 99.0 - Interest income on proceeds of transaction-related debt 2.5 - Gain on sa le of reinsurance recoverable 7.2 - Net real ized capita l (losses) gains (8.8) 227.5 Total revenue (GAAP measure) (B) 47,294.6$ 34,252.0$"
