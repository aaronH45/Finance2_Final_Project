Team O’Reilly’s unwavering commitment to providing unsurpassed levels of customer service each day drove our industry-leading 6.3% comparable store sales increase for the fourth quarter, which exceeded our guidance and resulted in a 6% comparable store sales increase for the full year, well above the guidance we set at the beginning of the year. Our unrelenting focus on profitable growth translated these strong top-line results into a record fourth quarter operating margin of 17.2% and a 26% increase in fourth quarter earnings per share, representing our 24th consecutive quarter of EPS growth greater than 15%. I would like to congratulate Team O’Reilly for exceeding our sales and profitability goals in yet another quarter and thank each of them for their continued hard work and dedication to our ongoing success.”
