Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

On January 30, 2015, we entered into an agreement for the financing of the fourth Oasis-class ship for Royal Caribbean International. This agreement makes available to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (the "Company"), upon acceptance and delivery of the ship, an unsecured term loan in an amount up to the US Dollar equivalent corresponding to approximately €931 million. Compagnie Française D’Assurance pour le Commerce Extérieur (“COFACE”), the official export credit agency of France, has agreed to guarantee 100% of the financing. 

The loan, once assigned to us upon delivery of the ship (scheduled for the second quarter of 2018), will amortize semi-annually and will mature twelve years thereafter. At our election, interest on the loan is expected to accrue either (1) at a fixed rate of 3.72% (inclusive of the applicable margin) or (2) at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.10%. The financing agreement contains customary events of default and prepayment events for, among other things, non-payment, breach of covenants, default on certain other indebtedness, certain large judgments and a change of control of the Company. 

Certain of the lenders participating in the facility, and affiliates of those parties, provide banking, investment banking and other financial services to us from time to time for which they have received, and will in the future receive, customary fees. 

The foregoing description of the provisions of the financing agreement is summary in nature and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete terms of the financing agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
