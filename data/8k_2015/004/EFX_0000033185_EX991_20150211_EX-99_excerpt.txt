ATLANTA, February 11, 2015 -- Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2014. The company reported revenue from continuing operations of $624.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an 8 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 10 percent increase in local currency. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted revenue increased 12 percent in local currency, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, excluding the impact of the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings in 2013.

Fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Equifax was $0.80, an increase of 29 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Equifax was $1.02, up 12 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013. This financial measure for 2014 excludes the acquisition-related amortization expense, net of associated tax impacts. This financial measure excludes the following items in 2013: the impact of the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, a restructuring charge to realign internal resources, an impairment of our investment in Boa Vista Servicos (“BVS”) and acquisition-related amortization expense, net of associated tax impacts as described more fully in the attached Q&A.

For the full year 2014, revenue was $2.4 billion, a 6 percent increase from 2013, both on a GAAP and adjusted basis. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Equifax was $2.97, a 10 percent increase from $2.69 for the full year 2013. On a non-GAAP basis, full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Equifax was $3.89, up 8 percent from the prior year period. This financial measure for 2014 excludes the settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements and acquisition-related amortization expense, net of associated tax impacts. This financial measure excludes the following items in 2013: the impact of the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, a restructuring charge to realign internal resources, an impairment of our investment in Boa Vista Servicos (“BVS”) and acquisition-related amortization expense, net of associated tax impacts as described more fully in the attached Q&A.

“Equifax ended the year with one of the strongest quarterly performances in many years driven by continued success in executing against our strategic growth initiatives during a challenging business environment. On many fronts, 2014 was a record year for Equifax,” said Richard F. Smith, Equifax’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We enter 2015 with optimism as the mortgage market headwinds abate, our acquisitions contribute to organic growth, and our new product launches deliver greater traction with our customers.”

For the first quarter, we expect revenue between $632 and $642 million, which is up approximately 8% to 10% over Q1 2014. Adjusted EPS, is expected to be between $1.00 and $1.03, up 12% to 16% year-over-year. Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 2% to 3% and Adjusted EPS by $0.02.

On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to grow 7% to 10% in 2015. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 11% to 14%.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures

Settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements – During the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements of $7.9 million ($5.0 million, net of tax) in our USIS segment. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to operating income when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Collection of certain reserved 2012 billings – During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded revenue of $7.2 million ($4.5 million, net of tax) that relates to the collection of revenue attributable to certain reserved billings prior to 2013 that did not originally meet the revenue recognition criteria due to collectability issues. Management believes excluding this revenue is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to revenue when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Charge related to resource realignment – During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a restructuring charge primarily to realign internal resources with our strategic opportunities. This charge of $9.3 million, pretax, ($5.9 million, net of tax) is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2013, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Impairment of BVS investment – During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an impairment of our cost method investment in BVS of $17.0 million, pretax, ($11.2 million, net of tax) in other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income due to indicators of impairment that arose during the quarter. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2012, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Diluted EPS and net income from continuing operations attributable to Equifax, adjusted for the settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements, collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, resource realignment charge, BVS investment impairment, and acquisition-related amortization expense, net of tax - We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the material cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in material cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax. Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital.

Adjusted revenue, adjusted operating income and operating margin, excluding the settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements, the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, and resource realignment charge- Management believes excluding the settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements, collection of certain reserved billings, and resource realignment charge from the calculation of operating income and margin, on a non-GAAP basis, is useful because management excludes items that are not comparable when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, and setting performance objectives, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that impact comparability.
