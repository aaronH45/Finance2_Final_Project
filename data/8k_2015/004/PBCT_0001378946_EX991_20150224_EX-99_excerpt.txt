Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP 

Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a  

non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People’s United  

Financial’s results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period.  

Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to, non-recurring  

gains/losses, merger-related expenses (including acquisition integration and other costs), charges  

related to executive-level management separation costs, severance-related costs and writedowns of  

banking house assets, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating  

earnings per share is derived by determining the per share impact of the respective adjustments to  

arrive at operating earnings and adding (subtracting) such amounts to (from) GAAP earnings per  

share. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by  

average assets. Operating return on average tangible stockholders' equity is calculated by dividing  

operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible stockholders' equity. The operating dividend  

payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.  

The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders’ equity (total stockholders’ equity less  

goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total  

assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the denominator). Tangible book  

value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders’ equity by common shares (total  

common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee  

Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") common shares).  

In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People’s  

United Financial for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from  

those used by other financial institutions. Please refer to People’s United Financial’s latest Form 10-Q  

regulatory filing for detailed reconciliations to GAAP figures.
