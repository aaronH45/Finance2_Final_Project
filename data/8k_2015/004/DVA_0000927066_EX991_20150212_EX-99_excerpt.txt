For the three months ended December 31, 2014, operating cash flow was $(70) million and free cash flow was $(197) million.

Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014, excluding a loss contingency reserve, was $1.832 billion. The quarter and year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from a $29 million net favorable impact resulting form the revenue recognition of certain California Medicaid payments received in prior periods, as discussed below.

 •   California Medicaid Revenue: The quarter and year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from revenue recognition of $35 million related to the resolution of dialysis payments received in prior periods from the California Medicaid program. The increase in revenue was reduced by certain related expenses resulting in a net increase in operating income of approximately $29 million and resulted in a non-recurring increase in net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. of approximately $14 million.  

 •   Volume: Total U.S. dialysis treatments for the fourth quarter of 2014 were 6,465,826, or 81,434 treatments per day, representing a per day increase of 6.2% over the fourth quarter of 2013. Non-acquired treatment growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 5.2% over the fourth quarter of 2013 and normalized non-acquired treatment growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased by 4.6% over the fourth quarter of 2013.  

The number of member months for which HCP provided capitated care during the fourth quarter of 2014 was approximately 2.5 million representing an increase of 9.4% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, inclusive of growth contributed from acquisitions.  

 •   Effective Tax Rate: Our effective tax rate was 29.3% and 34.1% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. This effective tax rate is impacted by the amount of third party owners’ income attributable to non-tax paying entities. The effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. was 33.3% and 38.1% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014 decreased due to the reinstatement of federal and state credits and a reduction in our tax reserves.  

We currently expect our 2015 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. to be approximately 39.5% to 40.5%.  

 •   Center Activity: As of December 31, 2014, we provided dialysis services to a total of approximately 180,000 patients at 2,270 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,179 centers are located in the United States and 91 centers are located in ten countries outside of the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we opened a total of 30 new dialysis centers, acquired two dialysis centers, and closed five dialysis centers in the United States. We also acquired three dialysis centers and opened one new dialysis centers outside of the United States.

This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to our guidance and expectations for our 2015 consolidated operating income, our 2015 Kidney Care operating income, HCP’s 2015 operating income, our 2015 consolidated operating cash flows and our 2015 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Factors that could impact future results include the uncertainties associated with the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, our subsequent quarterly and annual reports and our current reports on Form 8-K. The forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties.  

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of those risk factors in our SEC filings relating to:  

   •   the concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number of patients under such plans, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients,  

   •   a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare End Stage Renal Disease program or other government-based programs,  

   •   the impact of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 2015 Medicare Advantage benchmark structure,  

   •   risks arising from potential federal and/or state legislation that could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability,  

   •   changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies, or pharmaceutical pricing,  

   •   legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private-party proceedings and in compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement and the related restrictions on our business and operations required by the Corporate Integrity Agreement and other settlement terms, and the financial impact thereof,  

   •   our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector, that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates,  

   •   our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, including HCP, or to expand our operations and services to markets outside the United States,  

   •   the risk that we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, yet we might not be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at all,  

   •   risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements,  

   •   the risk that the cost of providing services under HCP’s agreements may exceed our compensation,  

   •   the risk that reductions in reimbursement rates, including Medicare Advantage rates, and future regulations may negatively impact HCP’s business, revenue and profitability,  

   •   the risk that HCP may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions or successfully address competitive threats that could reduce its profitability,  

   •   the risk that a disruption in HCP’s healthcare provider networks could have an adverse effect on HCP’s business operations and profitability,  

   •   the risk that reductions in the quality ratings of health maintenance organization plan customers of HCP could have an adverse effect on HCP’s business, or  

   •   the risk that health plans that acquire health maintenance organizations may not be willing to contract with HCP or may be willing to contract only on less favorable terms.  

We base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us at the time of this release, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.  

This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the attached reconciliation schedules. For the reasons stated in the reconciliation schedules, we believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information for investors.

 (1) These are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see attached reconciliation schedules.  

 (2) Consolidated percentages of revenues are comprised of the dialysis and related lab services business, HCP’s business and other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. General and administrative expenses includes certain corporate support and related long-term incentive compensation.  

 (3) The reported balance sheet amounts at December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2014, excludes $16.2 million and $16.9 million, respectively, of debt discount associated with our New Term Loan B. In addition, the reported balance sheet amounts at December 31, 2013 exclude $17.7 million of debt discounts associated with our then existing Term Loan B and Term Loan B-2.  

 (4) The New Term Loan B is subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. Because actual LIBOR, for all periods presented above, was lower than this embedded LIBOR floor, the interest rate on the New Term Loan B is set at its respective floor. At such time as the actual LIBOR-based variable component of our interest rate exceeds 0.75% on the New Term Loan B, we will then be subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility on the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on all of the New Term Loan B. However, we are limited to a maximum rate of 2.50% on $2.75 billion of outstanding principal debt on the New Term Loan B as a result of interest rate cap agreements. The remaining $748 million outstanding principal balance of the New Term Loan B is subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility above a floor of 0.75%.

Note 1: Calculation of the Leverage Ratio  

Under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (Credit Agreement), the leverage ratio is defined as all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued, minus cash and cash equivalents, divided by “Consolidated EBITDA”. The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its Term Loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following leverage ratio was calculated using “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined in the Credit Agreement. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of “Consolidated EBITDA”, pro forma for routine acquisitions that occurred during the period. The Company’s management believes the presentation of “Consolidated EBITDA” is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the Company’s leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In accordance with the Credit Agreement, the Company’s leverage ratio cannot exceed 5.00 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2014. At that date the Company’s leverage ratio did not exceed 5.00 to 1.00.

RECONCILIATIONS FOR NON-GAAP MEASURES

(dollars in thousands except for per share data)  

1. Income from continuing operations and diluted income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. excluding a loss contingency reserve, debt refinancing charges and a contingent earn-out obligation adjustment, net of related tax.  

We believe that income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. excluding a loss contingency reserve, debt refinancing charges and a contingent earn-out obligation adjustment, net of related tax, enhances a user’s understanding of our normal income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and diluted income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. for these periods by providing a measure that is meaningful because it excludes unusual amounts related to a loss contingency reserve related to the 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney Physician Relationship Investigations, the debt refinancing charges that resulted from the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the redemption of the $775 million 6  3⁄8% Senior Notes, as well as the termination of certain interest rate swap agreements and an adjustment to HCP’s contingent earn-out obligation, and accordingly, is comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and diluted income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. These measures are not measures of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and diluted income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.

In addition, we have excluded amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions from our adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and from our adjusted diluted income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. as we believe this presentation enhances a user’s understanding of our operating results for these periods by providing a different reflection of the Company’s operating performance since it excludes the amortization of intangible assets that relate to the remeasurement of acquired intangible assets associated with our acquisitions to fair value, and accordingly is indicative of consistent income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and diluted income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. These measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and diluted income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.

2. Operating income excluding a pre-tax loss contingency reserve, an adjustment to reduce a tax asset associated with the HCP acquisition escrow provisions, and a pre-tax contingent earn-out obligation adjustment.  

We believe that operating income excluding a pre-tax loss contingency reserve, an adjustment to reduce a tax asset associated with the HCP acquisition escrow provisions and a pre-tax contingent earn-out obligation adjustment enhances a user’s understanding of our normal operating income for these periods by providing a measure that is meaningful because it excludes unusual amounts that includes a loss contingency reserve related to the 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney Physician Relationship Investigations, an adjustment to reduce a tax asset associated with the HCP acquisition escrow provisions that was established as a receivable to offset any potential tax liabilities and an adjustment for HCP’s contingent earn-out obligation, and accordingly, is comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent operating income. This measure is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income.

3. Effective Income Tax Rates  

We believe that reporting the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. excluding noncontrolling owners’ income that primarily relates to non-tax paying entities is meaningful to an investor to fully understand the related income tax effects on DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.’s operating results. This is not a measure under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the effective income tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP.  

Effective income tax rate as compared to the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. is as follows:

4. Free cash flow and adjusted operating cash flow  

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less distributions to noncontrolling interests and capital expenditures for routine maintenance and information technology. We believe free cash flow is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under GAAP, since free cash flow is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisition and development activities and meet our debt service requirements. In addition, free cash flow excluding distributions to noncontrolling interests provides an investor with an understanding of free cash flows that are attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. We have also presented adjusted operating cash flow excluding the payment made in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the settlement of the 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney Physician Relationship Investigations. We believe this measure is meaningful to investors to understand our operating cash flows that were generated excluding this one-time unusual payment that was part of the Settlement Agreement. Free cash and adjusted operating cash flow are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.

5. Total care dollars under management  

In California, as a result of our managed care administrative services agreements with hospitals, HCP does not assume the direct financial risk for institutional (hospital) services in most cases, but is responsible for managing the care dollars associated with both the professional (physician) and institutional services being provided for the Per Member Per Month (PMPM) fee attributable to both professional and institutional services. In cases where HCP does not assume the direct financial risk, HCP recognizes the surplus of institutional revenue less institutional expense as HCP net revenue. In addition to revenues recognized for financial reporting purposes, HCP measures its total care dollars under management, which includes the PMPM fee payable to third parties for institutional (hospital) services where HCP manages the care provided to its members by the hospitals and other institutions, which are not included in GAAP revenues. HCP uses total care dollars under management as a supplement to GAAP revenues as it allows HCP to measure profit margins on a comparable basis across both the global capitation model (where HCP assumes the full financial risk for all services, including institutional services) and the risk sharing models (where HCP operates under managed care administrative services agreements where HCP does not assume the full risk). HCP believes that presenting amounts in this manner is useful because it presents its operations on a unified basis without the complication caused by models that HCP has adopted in its California market as a result of various regulations related to the assumption of institutional risk. Total care dollars under management is not a measure of financial performance computed in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues calculated in accordance with GAAP. Total care dollars under management includes PMPM payments received from third parties that are recorded net of expenses in our accounting records. The following table reconciles total care dollars under management to medical revenues to the periods indicated.
