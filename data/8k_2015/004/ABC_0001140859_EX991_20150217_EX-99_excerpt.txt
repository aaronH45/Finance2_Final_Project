$500 MILLION 4.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2045 

VALLEY FORGE, PA. February 17, 2015 —AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE: ABC) today announced that it priced $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% Senior Notes due March 1, 2025 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.25% Senior Notes due March 1, 2045 (collectively, the “Notes”), in an underwritten registered public offering. The offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement AmerisourceBergen filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 27, 2012. The offering is expected to close on February 20, 2015, subject to customary closing conditions. AmerisourceBergen intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with the net proceeds from the recently announced $1 billion senior unsecured term loan credit facility and cash on hand, to finance the previously disclosed proposed acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc. (“MWI”), and to pay related fees and expenses, including the retirement of all outstanding indebtedness of MWI. The offering is not contingent on the consummation of the Acquisition which, if completed, will occur subsequent to the closing of the offering. In the event that the Acquisition is not completed on or before May 15, 2015, or, if prior to such time, the acquisition agreement is terminated, other than in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, and is not otherwise amended or replaced, then the Notes are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. The Notes offering is expected to close prior to the consummation of the Acquisition.
