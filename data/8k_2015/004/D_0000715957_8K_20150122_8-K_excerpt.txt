2015 Annual Incentive Plan 

On January 22, 2015, the Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee (CGN Committee) approved the 2015 Annual Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Under the Plan, Dominion’s officers are eligible for an annual performance-based cash award. Each officer has a target incentive award under the Plan based on a percentage of base salary. For 2015, the target percentages of base salary for Dominion’s named executive officers are as follows: Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer – 125%; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer – 100%; Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer – Dominion Generation Group – 90%; Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer – Energy Infrastructure Group – 90%; and President and Chief Nuclear Officer – Dominion Nuclear – 70%. 

The Plan is funded based on the achievement of consolidated financial operating earnings goals, with potential funding ranging from 0% to 200% of the target funding with the CGN Committee retaining negative discretion with respect to funding for current and future named executive officers. For most officers, payout of the amount funded under the Plan is subject to achievement of applicable consolidated financial, business unit financial, and operating and stewardship goals, including safety goals and diversity and inclusion goals. For the named executive officers, payout of incentives under the Plan will be based solely on the achievement of the funding goals in order to preserve the deductibility pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) of any payouts they receive under the Plan.  

2015 Long-Term Incentive Program 

On January 22, 2015, the CGN Committee approved the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Program (the “Program”) for its officers, including its named executive officers. The Program is being awarded pursuant to Dominion’s 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan and consists of two components of equal value: a restricted stock grant and a cash-based performance grant. The restricted stock is subject to a three-year cliff vesting period, while payout of the performance grant will be based on the achievement of two performance metrics: total shareholder return relative to companies that are listed as members of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Utility Index (weighted 50%) and return on invested capital (weighted 50%). Payout on the performance grant will be made by March 15, 2017, with the amount of the award to vary depending on the level of achievement of the performance metrics. The CGN Committee retains authority to exercise negative discretion to lower payouts as it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion.
