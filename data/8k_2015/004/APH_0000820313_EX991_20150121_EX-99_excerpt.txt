AND NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

Wallingford, Connecticut. January 21, 2015. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) reported today fourth quarter 2014 diluted earnings per share excluding one-time items of $0.63 compared to $0.53 for the comparable 2013 period. (All per share and share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company’s 2-for-1 stock split effective October 9, 2014.) On an as reported basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.61 and $0.52 for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Such per share amount for the 2014 quarter includes one-time acquisition related costs of $10 million ($.02 per share) including approximately $8 million of amortization of the value associated with acquired backlog relating to an acquisition completed by the Company in the third quarter of 2014 and approximately $2 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Such per share amount for the 2013 period included a one-time charge for acquisition-related transaction costs of $3 million ($.01 per share) related to 2013 acquisitions. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2014 were a record $1.427 billion compared to $1.246 billion for the 2013 period. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the 2013 period. 

For the full year ended December 31, 2014, diluted earnings per share was $2.21 on an as reported basis and $2.25 excluding one-time items, compared to $1.96 on an as reported basis and $1.93 excluding one-time items for the comparable 2013 period. The 2014 period includes one-time expenses of $14 million ($.04 per share) relating to acquisition-related costs that include the amortization of acquired backlog of $10 million and transaction costs of $4 million. The 2013 period included one-time benefits of $9 million ($.03 per share) which included the net effect of (1) an income tax benefit of $15 million ($.04 per share) comprised of an $11 million reduction in tax expense due to the January 2, 2013 reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions with retroactive effect to 2012 as well as a $4 million reduction in tax expense due primarily to the completion of prior year audits and (2) acquisition-related transaction costs of $6 million ($.01 per share). 

Sales for the full year ended December 31, 2014 were $5.346 billion compared to $4.615 billion for the 2013 period. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $3 million for the full year 2014 compared to the 2013 period. 

Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated, “We are pleased to report new records of performance in the fourth quarter 2014, with sales and EPS of $1.427 billion and $0.63 (excluding one-time items), up 15% and 19% over the comparable 2013 quarter. The Company achieved growth in most markets with particular strength in the automotive, industrial and mobile networks markets. This growth was driven both organically and through the Company’s successful acquisition program. In addition, sales grew 5% sequentially. It is particularly rewarding that the Company’s unique entrepreneurial culture continues to drive an unwavering focus on profitability, resulting in record operating margins of 20.2% (excluding one-time items) in the fourth quarter, up 30 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points from prior year. This excellent performance is a direct result of our dynamic management team’s ability to drive margin expansion through outstanding operational execution and an unrelenting focus on all elements of cost. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $273 million, an excellent performance and confirmation of the quality of the Company’s earnings. I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.” 

“We close 2014 having grown 16% from 2013, with revenues of more than $5.3 billion, a new milestone for the Company. Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company’s growth opportunities. Consistent with this strategy, in December, the Company completed the acquisition of Goldstar Electric Systems Co., Ltd., a China-based high technology interconnect assembly company with annual sales of approximately $40 million. The acquisition significantly enhances the Company’s presence in the industrial market in China, in particular in the high growth heavy equipment segment. In addition to our successful acquisition program, the Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value, including the purchase in this quarter of 2.9 million shares of the Company’s stock. The Company has now completed the buyback authorized under the Company’s January 2013 stock repurchase program, and thus the Company’s Board of Directors has authorized a new two year open market stock repurchase plan effective January 21, 2015 for up to 10 million shares of the Company’s common stock.” 

“There continues to be a great deal of geopolitical and market uncertainty around the world, including in particular increased volatility and a significant weakening of certain overseas currencies. Considering this economic environment, and based on current currency exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2015 sales in the range of $1.286 billion to $1.326 billion, an increase of 3% to 6% in US dollars and 7% to 10% in local currencies over 2014, and diluted EPS (excluding one-time items) in the range of $0.55 to $0.57, an increase of 10% to 14% over 2014. For the year 2015, we expect to achieve sales in the range of $5.493 billion to $5.653 billion, an increase of 3% to 6% in US dollars and 6% to 9% in local currencies over 2014, and diluted EPS (excluding one-time items) of $2.41 to $2.49, an increase of 7% to 11% over 2014. We believe we can continue to perform well in the dynamic electronics marketplace due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team.” 

“The electronics revolution continues to accelerate, with new applications and higher performance requirements driving increased demand for our high technology products across all of our end markets. This creates a significant, long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength, as well as our initiatives to broaden and diversify our high technology product offerings, have created a solid base for future performance. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to the constantly changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position.”
