PEOPLE’S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME AND OPERATING EARNINGS OF $0.22 PER SHARE  

BRIDGEPORT, CT – People’s United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today reported net income of $64.7 million, or $0.22 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $59.3 million, or $0.20 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2013, and $61.6 million, or $0.21 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Operating earnings were $65.1 million, or $0.22 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $60.0 million, or $0.20 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2013, and $63.0 million, or $0.21 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.  

For the year ended December 31, 2014, net income totaled $251.7 million, or $0.84 per share, compared to $232.4 million, or $0.74 per share, for 2013. Operating earnings were $244.5 million, or $0.82 per share, for 2014, compared to $241.1 million, or $0.77 per share, for 2013. For 2014, operating earnings exclude a net after-tax gain of $13.4 million ($0.04 per share) resulting from the formation of a merchant services joint venture as well as non-operating expenses of $6.2 million after-tax ($0.02 per share).  

The Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.165 per share quarterly dividend, payable February 15, 2015 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2015. Based on the closing stock price on January 14, 2015, the dividend yield on People’s United Financial common stock is 4.6 percent.  

“We are pleased to report an increase in full-year operating earnings per share for the fifth consecutive year, especially in light of the persistently low interest rate environment,” commented Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our performance in 2014 demonstrates the benefits of our deep customer relationships, product breadth and ongoing strategic initiatives. We continued to build on the momentum generated in recent years by once again achieving meaningful growth in loans and deposits.”  

Barnes continued, “Looking forward to 2015, our businesses are well positioned in attractive markets and we are optimistic about further growth opportunities. We look to sustain momentum through continued investments in talent, products and services, as well as disciplined execution across each business. We remain committed to successfully building this organization for the long-term and delivering value to both customers and shareholders.”

“Our 2014 financial results reflected ongoing revenue growth and effective expense management,” stated David Rosato, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “We achieved strong annual loan and organic deposit growth of nine percent and five percent respectively, while maintaining superior asset quality metrics. Net interest income, driven primarily by continued strong loan originations, increased three percent from the prior year, despite a challenging interest rate and economic environment.”  

Rosato concluded, “We were particularly pleased to maintain flat operating expenses for the year considering the continued impact of strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance costs. Our ability to grow revenues and control costs resulted in improved operating leverage and remains an important area of focus for the organization.”  

Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average total loans on an annualized basis were 0.13 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, consistent with the third quarter of 2014 and improved from 0.18 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full-year of 2014, net loan charge-offs were 0.12 percent of average total loans compared to 0.19 percent in 2013. For the originated loan portfolio, non-performing loans equaled 0.77 percent of loans at December 31, 2014, compared to 0.79 percent at September 30, 2014 and 0.95 percent at December 31, 2013.  

Operating return on average assets of 0.75 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014 improved from 0.74 percent in the third quarter of 2014 and was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2013. Operating return on average tangible stockholders’ equity was 10.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to 9.9 percent for the third quarter of 2014 and 9.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2013.  

At December 31, 2014, People’s United Financial’s tier 1 common and total risk-based capital ratios were 9.8 percent and 12.2 percent, respectively, and the tangible equity ratio stood at 7.5 percent. People’s United Bank’s tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 10.5 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2014.

Loans acquired in connection with business combinations are initially recorded at fair value, determined based upon an estimate of expected cash flows, including a reduction for estimated credit losses, and without carryover of the respective portfolio’s historical allowance for loan losses. A decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate that a loan is impaired, which would require the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. As such, selected asset quality metrics have been highlighted to distinguish between the ‘originated’ portfolio and the ‘acquired’ portfolio.  

NON-PERFORMING ASSETS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Reported net of government guarantees totaling $17.6 million at Dec. 31, 2014, $18.1 million at Sept. 30, 2014, $18.4 million at June 30, 2014, $19.2 million at March 31, 2014 and $19.4 million at Dec. 31, 2013.  

 (2) Represents acquired loans that meet People’s United Financial’s definition of a non-performing loan but are not, under the accounting model for acquired loans, subject to classification as non-accrual in the same manner as originated loans. Because acquired loans are initially recorded at an amount estimated to be collectible, losses on such loans, when incurred, are first applied against the non-accretable difference established in purchase accounting and then to any allowance for loan losses recognized subsequent to acquisition.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP  

In addition to evaluating People’s United Financial’s results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management routinely supplements their evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People’s United Financial’s underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People’s United Financial’s capital position.  

The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People’s United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans and acquired loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). In addition, operating lease expense is excluded from total non-interest expense and netted against operating lease income within non-interest income to conform with the reporting approach applied to our other fee-based businesses that are already presented on a net basis. People’s United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.  

Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People’s United Financial’s results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to: (i) non-recurring gains/losses; (ii) merger-related expenses, including acquisition integration and other costs; (iii) charges related to executive-level management separation costs; (iv) severance-related costs; and (v) writedowns of banking house assets, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per share is derived by determining the per share impact of the respective adjustments to arrive at operating earnings and adding (subtracting) such amounts to (from) GAAP earnings per share. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average total assets. Operating return on average tangible stockholders’ equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible stockholders’ equity. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.  

The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders’ equity (total stockholders’ equity less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders’ equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) common shares).  

In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People’s United Financial for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.
