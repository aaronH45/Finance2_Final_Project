Item 1.04 Mine Safety - Reporting of Shutdowns and Patterns of Violations.

On January 28, 2015, FMC Wyoming Corporation, a subsidiary of FMC Corporation (herein referred to as "the Company"), received an imminent danger order issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 that had initially been served to an employee of a subcontractor the previous day at the Company’s Westvaco facility near Green River, Wyoming. MSHA served the subcontractor mechanic with the order after observation of him walking on the boom of a crane that was mounted on a truck parked in a contractor parking lot outside of the secured area at the mine site. The subcontractor, the primary contractor and the Company also received citations as a result of the same observation. The mechanic was not wearing personal protective equipment and had not received hazard training prior to starting work on the crane in the contractor parking lot. Upon notification, the subcontract mechanic came down from the crane. He has subsequently reported to site security and received safety training. The Company will post signs in the contractor parking lot area explicitly providing notification that no work is permitted in the parking lot until personnel check in with the security office and receive proper safety training. No injuries occurred as a result of the cited condition.
