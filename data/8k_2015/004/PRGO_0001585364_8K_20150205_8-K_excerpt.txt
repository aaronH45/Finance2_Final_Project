ITEM 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On February 5, 2015, Perrigo Company plc (the “Company”) released earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The press release related to the Company’s earnings is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

The earnings release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for Cost of sales, Gross profit, Operating expenses, Operating income, Interest expense, net, Other expense, net, Income (loss) before income taxes, Income tax expense (benefit), Net income (loss), Diluted weighted average shares outstanding, and Earnings (loss) per share within its earnings release to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for these non-GAAP measures. 

The Company excludes the items listed below in the applicable period when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business, and believes that presenting operating results excluding these items is also useful for investors, since it provides important insight into the Company's on-going core business operations on a normalized basis. Adjusted earnings is one of the primary indicators management uses for planning and forecasting in future periods, including trending and analyzing the core operating performance of the Company’s business from period to period without the effect of the non-core business items indicated. Management uses adjusted earnings to prepare operating budgets and forecasts and to measure the Company’s performance against those budgets and forecasts on a corporate and segment level.
