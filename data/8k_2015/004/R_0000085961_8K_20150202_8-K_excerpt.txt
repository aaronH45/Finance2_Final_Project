Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

On January 30, 2015, Ryder System, Inc. (the “Company”) and certain of its subsidiaries entered into Amendment No. 3 (the “Amendment”) to the Company’s Amended and Restated Global Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of June 8, 2011, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”), by and among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries and the financial institutions and other lenders named therein, including Bank of America, N.A, as administrative agent for the lenders, Royal Bank of Canada, as Canadian agent for the lenders, the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, as United Kingdom agent for the lenders, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, acting as joint lead arranger and sole book runner and with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., RBS Securities Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, RBC Capital Markets, U.S. Bank, National Association and BNP Paribas, acting as joint lead arrangers, together with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated. The Amendment increases the total commitments under the Company’s existing five-year syndicated global revolving credit facility from $900 million to $1.2 billion and extends the maturity date of the existing facility from October 2018 to January 2020. 

Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are unsecured and repayable at maturity on January 30, 2020. The maximum amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit permitted at any one time under the Credit Agreement is $1,200,000,000. The proceeds of the Credit Agreement are to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility will be based, at the Company's option, on LIBOR, EURIBOR, prime rate, federal funds effective rate or local equivalent rates plus, in each case, a margin based on the Company's credit rating. In addition, the Amendment establishes the annual facility fees, which range from 7.5 basis points to 25 basis points, that the Company will be required to pay the lenders based upon the Company's credit rating.

The lenders and agents (and their respective affiliates) have provided investment banking, cash management, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, leasing, foreign exchange, trust or other advisory services to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. These parties received customary compensation for these services.

Except as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K, the material terms of the Credit Agreement remain unchanged.
