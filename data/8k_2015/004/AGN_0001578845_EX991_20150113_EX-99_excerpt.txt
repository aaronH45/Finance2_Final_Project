Actavis Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  

Statements contained in this communication that refer to Actavis’ estimated or anticipated future results, including estimated synergies, or other non-historical facts are forward-looking statements that reflect Actavis’ current perspective of existing trends and information as of the date of this communication. Forward looking statements generally will be accompanied by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,” “could,” “should,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” or other similar words, phrases or expressions. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, including future financial and operating results, Actavis’ or Allergan’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and the expected timing of completion of the transaction. It is important to note that Actavis’ goals and expectations are not predictions of actual performance. Actual results may differ materially from Actavis’ current expectations depending upon a number of factors affecting Actavis’ business, Allergan’s business and risks associated with acquisition transactions. These factors include, among others, the inherent uncertainty associated with financial projections; restructuring in connection with, and successful closing of, the Allergan acquisition; subsequent integration of the Allergan acquisition and the ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of the Allergan acquisition; the ability to obtain required regulatory approvals for the transaction (including the approval of antitrust authorities necessary to complete the acquisition), the timing of obtaining such approvals and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the transaction; the ability to obtain the requisite Allergan and Actavis shareholder approvals; the risk that a condition to closing of the Allergan acquisition may not be satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the failure of the proposed transaction to close for any other reason; risks relating to the value of the Actavis shares to be issued in the transaction; the anticipated size of the markets and continued demand for Actavis’ and Allergan’s products; the impact of competitive products and pricing; access to available financing (including financing for the acquisition or refinancing of debt) on a timely basis and on reasonable terms; the risks of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the pharmaceutical industry, including product liability claims and the availability of product liability insurance on reasonable terms; the difficulty of predicting the timing or outcome of pending or future litigation or government investigations; periodic dependence on a small number of products for a material source of net revenue or income; variability of trade buying patterns; changes in generally accepted accounting principles; risks that the carrying values of assets may be negatively impacted by future events and circumstances; the timing and success of product launches; the difficulty of predicting the timing or outcome of product development efforts and regulatory agency approvals or actions, if any; market acceptance of and continued demand for Actavis’ and Allergan’s products; costs and efforts to defend or enforce intellectual property rights; difficulties or delays in manufacturing; the availability and pricing of third party sourced products and materials; successful compliance with governmental regulations applicable to Actavis’ and Allergan’s facilities, products and/or businesses; changes in the laws and regulations affecting, among other things, pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products; changes in tax laws or interpretations that could increase Actavis’ consolidated tax liabilities; the loss of key senior management or scientific staff; and such other risks and uncertainties detailed in Actavis’ periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to Actavis’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, as amended by Actavis’ Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on May 20, 2014 and December 5, 2014, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2014, in Warner Chilcott Limited’s Registration Statement on Form S-4 effective as of October 15, 2014, and the related prospectus, and from time to time in Actavis’ other investor communications.
