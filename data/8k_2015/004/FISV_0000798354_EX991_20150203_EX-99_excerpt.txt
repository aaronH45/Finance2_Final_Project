Press Release  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Information  

In this earnings release, we supplement our reporting of information determined in accordance with GAAP, such as revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, with “adjusted revenue,” “adjusted internal revenue growth,” “adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted income from continuing operations,” “adjusted earnings per share” and “free cash flow.” Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses enhance our shareholders’ ability to evaluate our performance because such items do not reflect how we manage our operations. Therefore, we exclude these items from GAAP revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities to calculate these non-GAAP measures.  

Examples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, gains or losses from unconsolidated affiliates, severance costs, merger costs and certain integration expenses related to acquisitions. We exclude these items to more clearly focus on the factors we believe are pertinent to the management of our operations, and we use this information to allocate resources to our various businesses.  

Free cash flow and adjusted internal revenue growth are non-GAAP financial measures and are described on page 10. We believe free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for strategic capital decisions. We believe adjusted internal revenue growth is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding the impact of postage reimbursements in our Output Solutions business, acquisitions and dispositions, and including deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. We believe this supplemental information enhances our shareholders’ ability to evaluate and understand our core business performance.  

These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures reflect management’s judgment of particular items and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

 1  Adjusted internal revenue growth is measured as the increase in adjusted revenue (see page 7), excluding the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions (“acquired revenue”), for the current period divided by adjusted revenue from the prior year period. Acquired revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 was ($1) million, due to a disposition in the Financial segment. Acquired revenue was $3 million for the full year 2014 ($2 million in the Payments segment and $1 million in the Financial segment).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2 Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and excludes the net change in settlement assets and obligations; tax-effected severance, merger and integration payments; certain transaction expenses attributed to the Open Solutions acquisition; certain cash distributions from StoneRiver; and other items which management believes may not be indicative of the future free cash flow of the company.  

 3 “Other adjustments” in 2014 removes $55 million of cash distributions from StoneRiver less related tax payments, and in 2013, adds back $60 million of cash payments for transaction expenses, transaction-related assumed liabilities, and merger and integration costs attributed to the acquisition of Open Solutions.
