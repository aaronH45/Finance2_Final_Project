 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (the “Company”) recently received six subpoenas from the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for documents from six different dialysis centers in Southern California operated by the Company. Specifically, each subpoena seeks the medical records of a single patient of the respective dialysis center.  

The Company has been advised by an attorney with the Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California that the subpoenas relate to an investigation concerning the medical necessity of patient transportation. However, the Company does not provide transportation or bill for the transport of its dialysis patients.  

The Company does not know the scope of the investigation or what Company activities might be the subject of the government investigation.
