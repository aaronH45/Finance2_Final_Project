[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company reported record fourth quarter operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation), reflecting higher full service lease revenue, growth in commercial rental revenue, as well as new business and increased volumes in Supply Chain Solutions (SCS). Total fourth quarter revenue growth was impacted by lower fuel prices passed through to customers. Operating and total revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2014 were as follows:

Commenting on the Company’s fourth quarter and full-year 2014 performance, Ryder Chairman and CEO Robert Sanchez said, “We closed 2014 with strong performance in Fleet Management Solutions, especially in our core lease and rental product lines. We were also encouraged that our Supply Chain Solutions business returned to both revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter. 

“For the full-year 2014, we grew operating revenue by 5% and earnings by 16%, achieving new record levels. We exceeded our expectations with full-year organic lease fleet growth of 3,200 vehicles, the highest growth rate in more than a decade. This represents the third consecutive year of organic lease fleet growth. Our transactional rental and used vehicle sales businesses delivered strong returns throughout the year. Fleet Management Solutions pre-tax margins of 12% were the highest in six years.

“We continued to see strong sales activity through the end of the year, and as such we have entered 2015 well positioned for growth. We continue to benefit from improving economic conditions in North America, which is our primary market. We are making meaningful progress on our strategy to penetrate non-outsourced transportation and logistics markets, supported by ongoing macro-trends that favor outsourcing.”

Fourth Quarter Business Segment Operating Results

Fleet Management Solutions 

In the FMS business segment, operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $930.8 million, up 6% compared with the year-earlier period. Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.15 billion, up 2% compared with the year-earlier period, as operating revenue growth was partially offset by the impact of lower fuel prices. Full service lease revenue increased 5% due to higher prices on replacement vehicles and growth in the fleet size. The number of full service lease vehicles (excluding U.K. trailers) increased by 3,200 from the year-earlier period and grew by 2,200 vehicles sequentially from the third quarter of 2014. Commercial rental revenue improved 10% reflecting increased demand and higher pricing in North America. Fuel services revenue decreased 15%, primarily reflecting lower fuel prices passed through to customers. 

FMS earnings before tax were $122.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, up 25% compared with $98.2 million in the same period of 2013. Increased earnings primarily reflect strong commercial rental performance and higher full service lease results. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of 

increased demand and higher pricing in North America. Rental power fleet utilization was 80.1% for the fourth quarter, up from 78.9% in the year-earlier period, on a 7% larger average fleet. Full service lease results benefited from lower depreciation associated with increased residual values and growth in the fleet size. Used vehicle sales benefited from stronger pricing, partially offset by lower volumes sold. FMS earnings before tax as a percentage of operating revenue were 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014, up 200 basis points from 11.2% in the same quarter a year ago.

Supply Chain Solutions

In the SCS business segment, fourth quarter 2014 operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $546.3 million, up 4%, and total revenue was $618.4 million, up 3%, compared with the same quarter a year ago. SCS operating revenue grew as a result of new business and increased volumes, partially offset by automotive business lost earlier in the year, lower fuel costs passed through to customers, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. 

SCS earnings before tax of $33.7 million increased 2% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $32.9 million in 2013 due to new business and higher volumes. These improvements were partially offset by higher insurance costs. SCS earnings before tax as a percentage of operating revenue were 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014, down from 6.3% in the year-earlier period.

Corporate Financial Information

Central Support Services

Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Most CSS costs are allocated to the business segments. In the fourth quarter of 2014, CSS costs were $64.0 million, up from $58.0 million in the year-earlier period, primarily driven by planned higher investments in information technology and marketing, as well as higher compensation-related expenses.

Pension and Other Items Excluded from Comparable Earnings 

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company reduced the size and potential future volatility of its U.S. pension plan obligation by offering former employees a one-time option to receive a lump sum distribution of their vested benefits. The offer was made to approximately 11,000 former employees and was accepted by approximately 60%. As a result, the Company settled $259 million, or 12% of its U.S. pension obligation. All distributions were funded using existing plan assets. The transaction resulted in the immediate recognition of $97.2 million ($61.3 million after tax), or $1.16 per diluted share, of previously unrecognized actuarial losses. This non-cash charge is excluded from comparable earnings.

Fourth quarter comparable results also excluded other charges of $11.3 million ($6.9 million after tax) or $0.13 per diluted share in 2014 and $1.6 million ($0.9 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share in 2013, associated with multi-employer pension plan settlement charges. 

Non-operating components of pension costs are excluded from both comparable earnings and segment earnings before tax in order to more accurately reflect the operating performance of the business. Non-operating pension costs totaled $2.5 million ($1.4 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014, down from $9.0 million ($5.3 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share in the year-earlier period. The decrease was primarily due to higher-than-expected asset returns in 2013. 

Comparable fourth quarter 2014 results also excluded pre-tax restructuring and other charges of $2.8 million ($1.8 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share and acquisition-related tax adjustments related to prior years of $1.8 million (before and after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share. The Company expects these restructuring actions to produce savings beginning in 2015. 

Income Taxes

The Company’s effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 15.1% of pre-tax earnings, compared with 32.5% in the year-earlier period. The Company’s fourth quarter 2014 comparable effective income tax rate was 34.4% of comparable earnings before tax, versus 33.3% in the prior year. The increase in the comparable effective income tax rate was due to increased earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures from continuing operations increased to $2.30 billion for 2014, compared with $2.18 billion in the same period of 2013. The increase in capital expenditures primarily reflects planned investments in the commercial rental fleet. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) from continuing operations were $1.68 billion in 2014 including increased proceeds from vehicle sales and a vehicle sale-leaseback transaction, down from $1.73 billion in the same period of 2013. 

Cash Flow 

Operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2014 was $1.37 billion, up from $1.22 billion in the same period of 2013 due to higher cash-based earnings. Total cash generated from continuing operations (including proceeds from used vehicle sales) in 2014 was $2.06 billion, compared with $1.75 billion in the same period of 2013. The increase in total cash generated included a $126 million sale-leaseback transaction. Free cash flow from continuing operations in 2014 was negative $202 million and 

better than expected due to timing of cash payments, compared with negative $386 million for the same period of 2013.

Leverage

Balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2014 increased by $320 million compared with year-end 2013, due to investments in vehicles to fund growth, dividends, and share repurchases. Balance sheet debt to equity as of December 31, 2014 was 248% compared with 221% at year-end 2013. Total obligations to equity as of December 31, 2014 were 258% compared with 226% at year-end 2013. Approximately 23 percentage points of the increase reflected a higher pension equity charge, due to annual pension assumption updates made at year end. Total obligations to equity remain within Ryder’s long-term target range of 225% to 275%. 

2015 Earnings Forecast

Commenting on the Company’s outlook, Mr. Sanchez said, “In 2015, we expect to continue our strong momentum and deliver record results with increasing revenue growth and double-digit earnings improvement. We anticipate strong performance in our Fleet Management Solutions business with an accelerating organic growth rate in our full service lease fleet. We are excited to expand our new on-demand maintenance product to more large fleet customers, based on strong interest during the pilot phase. We expect our dedicated solution to realize significant revenue and earnings growth and Supply Chain Solutions earnings performance to recover nicely in 2015. 

“We plan to make significant investments to grow the business this year, with a focus on efficient use of capital. Our return on capital spread and return on equity are expected to reach record levels in 2015.” 

Ryder forecasts full-year 2015 comparable earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $6.25 to $6.40 per diluted share, up 12% to 15% from $5.58 per diluted share in 2014. Full-year earnings comparisons exclude pension costs and other restructuring charges of $0.25 per diluted share in 2015, and $1.44 in 2014 as previously disclosed. Operating revenue (which starting in 2015 excludes all fuel and subcontracted transportation) for the full-year 2015 is forecast to be up 7% to approximately $5.64 billion. Total revenue for the full-year 2015 is forecast to be up 3% to approximately $6.84 billion. The Company is also establishing a first quarter 2015 comparable earnings forecast of $0.95 to $1.00 per diluted share, up 3% to 9% from $0.92 in the first quarter of 2014. This reflects continuing solid lease, dedicated, and used vehicle results, partially offset by lower contributions from supply chain earnings earlier in the year, and challenging year-over-year rental comparisons. First quarter earnings comparisons exclude pension costs and other restructuring charges of $0.08 per diluted share in 2015.

Capital Expenditures: In Ryder’s business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder’s FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in ongoing revenues and cash flows to Ryder, typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company’s fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
