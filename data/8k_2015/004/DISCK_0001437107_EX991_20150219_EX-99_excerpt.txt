Full Year Results

Full year revenues of $6,265 million increased $730 million, or 13%, compared to the full year a year ago, as International Networks was up 28% and U.S. Networks was flat, primarily due to additional revenues from licensing agreements in the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization(1) (“OIBDA”) increased 4% to $2,491 million, as International Networks was up 18% while U.S. Networks was down 2% due to the impact of licensing agreements. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced full year revenue growth by 2% and Adjusted OIBDA growth by 3%. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, the impact of newly acquired businesses(2), licensing agreements and the consolidation of Discovery Family, total Company revenues increased 7% and Adjusted OIBDA increased 6%. 

Discovery Communications, Inc.'s full year net income of $1,139 million ($1.66 per diluted share)(3) increased $64 million, or 6%, compared to $1,075 million ($1.49 per diluted share) for the full year 2013, primarily due to improved operating performance as well as lower mark-to-market equity-based compensation, lower losses on derivatives and lower taxes, partially offset by higher restructuring costs, gains associated with the consolidation of new businesses in 2013 and increased amortization associated with purchase price allocation. Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share(4) ("Adjusted EPS"), which excludes the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, was $1.84 for the full year, up 13% compared with $1.63 for full year 2013.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow

In addition to the results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) provided in this release, the Company has presented Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow. The Company evaluates the operating performance of its segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted OIBDA is defined as revenues less costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses excluding: (i) mark-to-market equity-based compensation, (ii)depreciation and amortization, (iii) amortization of deferred launch incentives, (iv) restructuring and other charges, (v) certain impairment charges, (vi) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and (vii) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios. 

Beginning January 1, 2014, the Company reclassified foreign currency gains (losses), net due to transaction settlements and re-measurement of working capital items from selling, general and administrative expense, which is a component of operating income, to other income (expense), net. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  The total foreign currency reclassifications were a loss of $1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013 and a gain of $23 million for the full year 2013.  

The Company uses Adjusted OIBDA to assess operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes this measure is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes mark-to-market equity-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, and gains and losses on business and asset dispositions from the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA due to their volatility. The Company also excludes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Additionally, certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. 

The Company defines Adjusted net income as net income available to Discovery Communications, Inc. excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and defines Adjusted EPS as earnings excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets per diluted share. Note that given the change in conversion ratio for our preferred stock, the preferred shares are now only included in the diluted share count. The Company believes Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS are relevant to investors because these metrics allow them to evaluate the performance of the Company's operations exclusive of the non-cash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets that impact the comparability of results from period to period.

The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less acquisitions of property and equipment. The Company uses free cash flow as it believes it is an important indicator for management and investors of the Company’s liquidity, including its ability to reduce debt, make strategic investments and return capital to stockholders.

Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures, and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, earnings per diluted share and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Please review the supplemental financial schedules beginning on page 12 for reconciliations to GAAP measures.
