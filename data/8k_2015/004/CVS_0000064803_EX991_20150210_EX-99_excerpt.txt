WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, February 10, 2015 - CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) today announced operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014.

Revenues

Net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2014, increased 12.9%, or $4.2 billion to $37.1 billion, up from $32.8 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, total revenue increased 9.9%, or $12.6 billion to $139.4 billion, compared to $126.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Revenues in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 21.7% to $23.9 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2014. This increase was driven by growth in specialty pharmacy including the acquisition of Coram and the impact of Specialty ConnectTM, as well as increased volume in pharmacy network claims. Pharmacy network claims processed during the three months ended December 31, 2014, increased 8.2% to 221.6 million, compared to 204.9 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to net new business and growth in Managed Medicaid. Mail choice claims processed during the three months ended December 31, 2014, increased approximately 1.4% to 21.3 million compared to 21.0 million in the prior year period. The increase in the mail choice claim volume was primarily due to increased claims associated with the continuing adoption of our Maintenance Choice® offerings, partially offset by a decline in traditional mail volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, total revenue in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 16.1% to $88.4 billion, compared to $76.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2013.

Revenues in the Retail Pharmacy Segment increased 2.9% to $17.7 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2014. Same store sales increased 1.6% over the prior year period, with pharmacy same store sales up 5.5% and front store same store sales down 7.2%. Front store same store sales would have been approximately 800 basis points higher if tobacco and the estimated associated basket sales were excluded from the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Front store same store sales were negatively impacted by softer customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in basket size. Pharmacy same store prescription volumes rose 5.3% on a 30-day equivalent basis. Pharmacy same store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points due to recent generic introductions and by approximately 190 basis points from the implementation of Specialty Connect. Specialty Connect transitioned all specialty prescriptions to the Pharmacy Services Segment, as they are now being processed through the Company's specialty mail order pharmacies. The implementation of Specialty Connect had a greater effect on revenues than prescription volumes due to the higher dollar value of specialty products. For the year ended December 31, 2014, total revenue in the Retail Pharmacy Segment increased 3.3% to $67.8 billion, compared to $65.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2013. Same store sales increased 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014, over the prior year, with pharmacy same store sales up 4.8% and front store same store sales down 4.0%. Front store same store sales would have been approximately 350 basis points higher if tobacco and the estimated associated basket sales were excluded from the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

For the three months ended December 31, 2014, the generic dispensing rate increased approximately 125 basis points to 82.1% in our Pharmacy Services Segment and increased approximately 140 basis points to 82.4% in our Retail Pharmacy Segment, compared to the prior year.

Operating Profit and Net Income

Operating profit for the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy segments for the three months ended December 31, 2014 increased 0.9% and 6.5%, respectively. Both segments benefited from the impact of increased generic drugs dispensed and favorable purchasing economics, which improved operating margins. The Pharmacy Services Segment was also positively impacted by growth in specialty pharmacy, which was mostly offset by client price compression and the incremental investment in the 2015 welcome season as a result of a successful selling season. The Retail Pharmacy Segment was also positively impacted by the growth of prescription volumes combined with an improved pharmacy margin rate, partially offset by the loss of gross profit from tobacco and the associated basket, as well as incremental store operating costs associated with operating more stores. Operating profit for the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy segments for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased 13.8% and 7.9%, respectively. Both segments benefited from the impact of increased generic drugs dispensed and favorable purchasing economics. The Pharmacy Services Segment was also positively impacted by growth in specialty pharmacy. The Retail Pharmacy Segment was also positively impacted by growth of prescription volumes combined with an improved pharmacy margin rate, partially offset by the loss of sales from tobacco and the associated basket, as well as incremental store operating costs associated with operating more stores.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased 1.2% or $53 million, to $4.6 billion, compared to the prior year. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes a $521 million pre-tax loss ($0.27 per share) on early extinguishment of debt. Excluding the loss on early extinguishment of debt and a $72 million pre-tax gain ($0.04 per share) from a legal settlement in 2013, net income increased 9.0%(1). Adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, was $4.22 and $4.00, respectively. Excluding the 2014 loss on early extinguishment of debt and the 2013 gain from the legal settlement, Adjusted EPS increased 13.5% to $4.49. Adjusted EPS excludes $518 million and $494 million of acquisition related intangible asset amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. GAAP EPS for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $3.96, which also includes the loss on early extinguishment of debt, compared to $3.75 in the prior year, which includes the gain from the legal settlement.

President and CEO Larry Merlo, stated, “By any measure, 2014 was a great year for our company. We delivered strong financial performance, with solid year-over-year growth in revenues, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow. Our performance in the fourth quarter was no exception, with Adjusted EPS increasing 8.4%, coming in at the high end of our expectations. At the same time, we generated free cash flow for the full-year of $6.5 billion, exceeding our expectations.”

(1)Excluding the $72 million pre-tax ($44 million after-tax) gain on a legal settlement for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the $521 million pre-tax ($315 million after-tax) loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2014, net income increased $411 million or 9.0% from $4,548 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $4,959 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Mr. Merlo continued, “Our results underscore the fact that we are winning in the marketplace and, as a result, driving solid and sustainable growth. I’m pleased with the very successful selling season we had for 2015, with gross client wins of $7 billion and net new client business of $3.6 billion. 2014 will be remembered as the year in which we rebranded our company as CVS Health and made the right decision to exit the tobacco category, better aligning our company with patients, payors, and providers. Only CVS Health has an integrated enterprise model bringing differentiated, channel-agnostic solutions to the marketplace.”
