THE MOSAIC COMPANY RAISES 2014 GUIDANCE

EXPECTS FOURTH QUARTER EPS

IN THE RANGE OF $0.93 TO $0.98

PLYMOUTH, Minn., January 19, 2015 - The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) announced today that it expects reported phosphates volume and phosphates and potash margins will exceed previously provided guidance ranges, and that potash volumes will be at the high end of guidance range, resulting in fourth quarter 2014 earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.93 to $0.98 per share, including approximately $0.10 in net benefits from notable items. The notable items include early estimates of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to the acquisition of a Brazilian distribution business, which may change. We expect earnings, excluding notable items, to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.88 per share. 

 “Demand for potash and phosphates exceeded our expectations during the fourth quarter,” said Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We were cautiously optimistic going into the fall application season with good crop nutrient affordability and an empty supply chain, but customers came to the market in force, as they sought to position inventory in anticipation of a strong spring season and increasing crop nutrient prices. 

 “At Mosaic, we were prepared to meet the surge in demand, and our results for the quarter reflect the earnings power our business can deliver in good markets. Our Phosphates business sold 3.3 million tonnes of finished product during the quarter - well above our expectations - and our Potash business produced at a high operating rate due to a successful proving run at the Colonsay mine. 

“We expect further business strength as we move into 2015, with strong demand for potash and phosphates continuing. We expect the first quarter of 2015 to reflect normal seasonal spring demand, minimally impacted by accelerated purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014, and are excited for the opportunities we see in the coming year.”
