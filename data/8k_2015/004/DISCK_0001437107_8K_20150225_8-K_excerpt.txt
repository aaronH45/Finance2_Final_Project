Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On February 25, 2015, Discovery Communications, LLC (“DCL”) and Discovery Communications, Inc. (the “Guarantor”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and RBS Securities Inc., as the representatives of the several underwriters named therein, for the issuance and sale by DCL of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.45% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-182194) and a related preliminary prospectus supplement and final prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering of the Notes is expected to close on March 2, 2015, subject to customary closing conditions.  

The Notes were priced at 99.915% of their principal amount.  

DCL expects the net proceeds from the offering to be approximately $296.8 million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses related to the offering.  

DCL intends to use the net proceeds to repay a portion of its 3.700% Senior Notes due June 2015 and for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of companies or businesses, repayment and refinancing of debt, working capital, capital expenditures and the repurchase by the Guarantor of its capital stock.  

The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 19, 2009, and a supplemental indenture (collectively, the “Indenture”) to be entered into among DCL, the Guarantor and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. DCL’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by the Guarantor (the “Guarantee”).  

The above description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
