Actavis Announces Pricing of Public Offerings of Ordinary Shares and Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares in Connection with Pending Acquisition of Allergan  

DUBLIN, IRELAND – Feb. 24, 2015 – Actavis plc (NYSE: ACT) today announced that it has priced its concurrent offerings of 13,194,445 Ordinary Shares at $288.00 per share and 4,600,000 5.500% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares, Series A, at $1,000.00 per share, each being offered in a separate registered public offering.  

The net proceeds from the Ordinary Shares offering and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares offering will be approximately $3.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, in each case after estimated underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses payable by Actavis plc. Actavis plc intends to use the net proceeds from these offerings, together with additional debt financing, including senior unsecured notes and borrowings under unsecured term loan facilities and an unsecured cash bridge loan facility and, if and to the extent all or a portion of the net proceeds from these offerings and/or financings are not available, an unsecured bridge loan facility, to finance the cash consideration for its previously announced acquisition (the “Allergan Acquisition”) of Allergan, Inc. (“Allergan”) and certain related transactions and financing expenses.  

These offerings are separate public offerings made by means of separate prospectus supplements and are not contingent on each other or upon the consummation of the Allergan  

 Acquisition. If for any reason the Allergan Acquisition does not close, then Actavis plc expects to use the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares and the redemption or repurchase of indebtedness. In addition, the underwriters in each respective offering have been granted an option to purchase up to an additional 10% of Ordinary Shares and up to an additional 10% of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares.  

Unless converted earlier, each Mandatory Convertible Preferred Share will convert automatically on March 1, 2018 (the “mandatory conversion date”), into between 2.8345 and 3.4722 Ordinary Shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based on the average volume-weighted average price per share of Actavis plc’s Ordinary Shares over the 20 consecutive trading day period commencing on and including the 22nd scheduled trading day immediately preceding the mandatory conversion date.  

Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by Actavis plc’s board of directors, at an annual rate of 5.500% on the liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share. The dividends may be paid in cash, or, subject to certain limitations, in Ordinary Shares of Actavis plc or any combination of cash and Ordinary Shares of Actavis plc on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2015, and to, and including, March 1, 2018.  

J.P. Morgan, Mizuho Securities, Wells Fargo Securities, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Citigroup are the joint book-running managers on the Ordinary Shares and Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares offerings.  

The offerings are being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Each offering will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement relating to such offering and the accompanying base prospectus, copies of which may be obtained by contacting: J.P.
