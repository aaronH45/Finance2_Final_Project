        "Supplemental Financial DataTier 1 Common Equity under Basel III ($ in millions) 33 The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio further adjusts Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets to account for the final rule approved by U.S. banking regulators in July 2013 for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The final Basel III capital rules are effective January 1, 2015 for banking organizations subject to the standardized approach. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.1Tier 1 Capital and risk-weighted assets as defined in accordance with regulation.2Estimated ratios based on the standardized approach in the final rule, as fully phased-in, and excluding most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).3December 31, 2014 Tier 1 Capital and Risk-Weighted assets are estimated.
