 Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.  

On February 6, 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency provided written notice of its approval for the conversion of People’s United Bank (the “Bank”) from a federally-chartered savings bank to a national banking association under the name “People’s United Bank, National Association.” The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of People’s United Financial, Inc. (the “Company”). The Company believes that the national bank charter is better aligned with the Bank’s commercial banking business model. Conversion to the new charter is expected to become effective later this month.  

On December 16, 2014, the Company received written notice from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “FRB”), notifying the Company of the FRB’s approval of the Company becoming a bank holding company, contingent on consummation of the Bank’s charter conversion. The Company will become a bank holding company effective concurrently with the conversion.  

The information contained in this Form 8-K with respect to Item 7.01 is being furnished to, and not filed with, the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with General Instruction B.2 to Form 8-K.
