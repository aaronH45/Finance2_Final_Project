Actavis and Allergan Announce Early Termination of Hart-Scott-Rodino

and Record Dates for Shareholder Meetings  

DUBLIN, IRELAND and IRVINE, CA – January 12, 2015 – Actavis plc (NYSE: ACT) and Allergan, Inc. (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act) with respect to Actavis’ pending acquisition of Allergan.  

On December 1, 2014, Actavis and Allergan filed Pre-Merger Notification and Report Forms required under the HSR Act with the FTC. On December 29, 2014, Actavis voluntarily withdrew and subsequently re-filed these forms.  

The early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act satisfies one of the conditions to the closing of the pending acquisition, which remains subject to other customary closing conditions, including receipt of shareholder and other regulatory approvals.  

Actavis and Allergan also announced today that they have set the close of business on January 22, 2015 as the record date for determining the shareholders that will be entitled to vote at their respective special meetings of shareholders to be held in connection with the pending acquisition.
