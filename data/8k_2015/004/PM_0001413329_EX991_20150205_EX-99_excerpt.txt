NEW YORK, February 5, 2015 -- Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE / Euronext Paris: PM) today announced its 2014 full-year and fourth-quarter results. 

“We delivered a solid currency-neutral performance in 2014, reflecting robust pricing, strong market share gains, notably in the EU Region, and very substantial progress in addressing the specific market challenges that we outlined at the beginning of the year. We successfully executed on our key strategic initiatives, including the pilot launches of our Reduced-Risk Product, iQOS, the roll-out of the Marlboro 2.0 Architecture and the optimization of our manufacturing footprint," said André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer.

“Despite a historically high adverse currency headwind, we enter 2015 with strong business momentum that underpins our target annual growth rates, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 4% to 6% for net revenues, 6% to 8% for adjusted operating companies income and 8% to 10% for adjusted diluted earnings per share." 

"We remain steadfast in our aim to return around 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. However, given the recent extreme currency volatility, we are focused on managing our cash flow prudently and on maintaining our financial flexibility for business development opportunities. Consequently, our full-year guidance does not currently envisage any share repurchases in 2015, although we will revisit the potential for such purchases as the year unfolds depending on the currency environment.”

Dividends and Share Repurchase Program

PMI increased its regular quarterly dividend during 2014 to $1.00, up by 6.4% from $0.94, which represents an annualized rate of $4.00 per common share. Since its spin-off in March 2008, PMI has increased its regular quarterly dividend by 117.4% from the initial annualized rate of $1.84 per common share.

During the fourth quarter, PMI spent $800 million to repurchase 9.3 million shares. For the full-year 2014, PMI spent $3.8 billion to repurchase 45.2 million shares. Under the current $18 billion share repurchase program, PMI has spent $12.7 billion to repurchase 144.6 million shares, as shown in the table below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Since May 2008, when PMI began its first share repurchase program, the company has spent an aggregate of $37.7 billion to repurchase 601.4 million shares, or 28.5% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin-off in March 2008, at an average price of $62.61 per share.

Global Manufacturing Footprint Restructuring 

In 2014, as part of the company's ongoing efforts to enhance the cost efficiency of its global manufacturing operations, PMI:

Ceased cigarette production in Australia, incurring an after-tax charge of $0.01 per share for asset impairment and exit costs; 

Discontinued cigarette production at its factory located in Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands. As a result, PMI incurred a full-year pre-tax charge of $489 million, or an after-tax charge of $0.24 per share, reflecting $350 million primarily related to employee separation costs and $139 million related to asset impairment costs; and

Closed a leaf processing facility in Brampton, Canada and adopted, on November 5, 2014, a new leaf-buying model in the United States, effective April 1, 2015, under which the company will transition from directly purchasing tobacco through contracts with U.S. growers to purchasing through two suppliers, Alliance One

International Inc. and Universal Corporation. As a result of these two leaf initiatives, PMI incurred a combined after-tax charge of $0.01 per share for asset impairment and exit costs.

Business Development 

On June 26, 2014, the company announced its acquisition of 100% of Nicocigs Limited (“Nicocigs”), a leading U.K.-based e-vapor company whose principal brand is Nicolites. The transaction was not subject to regulatory approval and is not material to PMI’s 2014 consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

The acquisition is complementary to PMI's previously announced agreement for the license and distribution of Altria Group, Inc.’s e-vapor products. In addition, it provides PMI with immediate access to, and a significant presence in, the growing e-vapor category in the U.K. market.

Productivity and Cost Savings Program

In 2014, PMI exceeded its one-year gross productivity and cost savings target of $300 million.

In 2015, PMI's productivity and cost savings initiatives will include, but are not limited to, the continued enhancement of production processes, the harmonization of tobacco blends, the streamlining of product specifications and number of brand variants, supply chain improvements and overall spending efficiency across the company. PMI anticipates that these initiatives, combined with savings associated with the manufacturing footprint restructuring implemented in 2014, notably in Australia and the Netherlands, should result in a total company cost base increase, excluding RRPs and currency, of approximately 1%.

2014 FULL-YEAR AND FOURTH-QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

In this press release, “PMI” refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries. References to total international cigarette market, defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the United States, total cigarette market, total market and market shares are PMI estimates based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or PMI's duty-free business. North Africa is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. The term “net revenues” refers to operating revenues from the sale of our products, excluding excise taxes and net of sales and promotion incentives. Operating companies income, or “OCI,” is defined as operating income, excluding general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles, plus equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, net. PMI's management evaluates business segment performance and allocates resources based on OCI. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items. Management also reviews OCI, OCI margins and earnings per share, or “EPS,” on an adjusted basis (which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items), as well as free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, and net debt. PMI believes it is appropriate to disclose these measures as they improve comparability and help investors analyze business performance and trends. Non-GAAP measures used in this release should be neither considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Comparisons are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures, see the relevant schedules provided with this press release. In 2013, PMI concluded a number of business development initiatives and agreements that were not accounted for as acquisitions; thus, non-GAAP financial measures for 2013 that exclude acquisitions do not exclude the impact of said initiatives and agreements. Reduced-Risk Products (“RRPs”) is the term the company uses to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes. PMI’s RRPs are in various stages of development, and we are conducting extensive and rigorous scientific studies to determine whether we can support claims for such products of reduced exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke, and ultimately claims of reduced disease risk, when compared to smoking combustible cigarettes. Before making any such claims, we will need to evaluate rigorously the full set of data from the relevant scientific studies to determine whether they substantiate reduced exposure or risk. Any such claims may also be subject to government review and approval, as is the case in the United States today. Trademarks and service marks in this press release that are the registered property of, or licensed by, the subsidiaries of PMI, are italicized.

NET REVENUES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2014 Full-Year 

Net revenues of $29.8 billion were down by 4.6%, including unfavorable currency of $2.1 billion. Net revenues increased by 2.1%, excluding currency, or by 2.0%, excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by favorable pricing of $1.9 billion across all Regions, led by: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Egypt, reflecting the impact of the change to PMI's new business structure announced on January 29, 2014, Germany, Indonesia, Russia and Ukraine, partially offset by Italy, reflecting the adverse annualized impact of the October 2013 VAT increase and the price repositioning of Chesterfield, and the Philippines, mainly reflecting the partial absorption of the January 2014 excise tax increase in response to competitive dynamics. The favorable pricing was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix of $1.3 billion, mainly reflecting: lower volume/mix in Australia, resulting from a lower total market following the impact of tax-driven price increases in 2014, and lower market share, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of current competitive dynamics; lower volume/mix in Indonesia, mainly reflecting lower share; and lower volume and market share in Japan resulting from a lower total market following the consumption tax-driven price increases of April 1, 2014, as well as the unfavorable impact of an adjustment in distributor inventories.

2014 Fourth-Quarter

Net revenues of $7.2 billion were down by 7.6%, including unfavorable currency of $681 million. Net revenues increased by 1.1%, excluding currency, or by the same percentage excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by favorable pricing of $512 million across all Regions, led by: Argentina, Egypt, reflecting the impact of the change to PMI's new business structure announced on January 29, 2014, Indonesia and Russia, partially offset by the Philippines, mainly reflecting the partial absorption of the January 2014 excise tax increase in response to competitive dynamics. The favorable pricing was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix of $430 million, predominantly due to: lower volume/mix in Australia, resulting from a lower total market following the impact of tax-driven price increases in 2014, and lower market share, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of current competitive dynamics; and lower volume in Japan resulting from a lower total market following the consumption tax-driven price increases of April 1, 2014, as well as the unfavorable impact of an adjustment in distributor inventories.

EUROPEAN UNION REGION (EU)

2014 Full-Year

Net revenues of $8.8 billion increased by 2.8%. Excluding favorable currency of $122 million, net revenues increased by 1.4%, or by 1.3% excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by favorable pricing of $127 million, notably in Germany and Poland, despite the adverse impact of the October 2013 VAT increase and price repositioning of Chesterfield in Italy. The favorable pricing was partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix of $17 million, predominantly resulting from a lower total market, notably in France, Poland and the United Kingdom, partly offset by a higher total market in Germany and Italy and higher share in all key markets. 

Reported operating companies income of $3.7 billion decreased by 12.1%, including favorable currency of $37 million. Excluding currency, operating companies income decreased by 12.9%, and by the same percentage excluding currency and acquisitions, mainly due to higher asset impairment and exit costs of $490 million primarily related to the discontinuation of cigarette production in the Netherlands. Excluding the impact of these asset impairment and exit costs, operating companies income, excluding currency and acquisitions, decreased by 1.6%, due to: unfavorable volume/mix of $46 million, reflecting a lower total market; increased marketing costs related to the Be Marlboro campaign and the roll-out of the new Marlboro 2.0 brand Architecture; investments related to the pilot launch and commercialization of iQOS in Italy; and business building initiatives in the United Kingdom; partly offset by favorable pricing.

The total cigarette market in the EU of 467.7 billion units decreased by 3.1%, due primarily to the impact of tax-driven price increases and the unfavorable economic and employment environment, partly offset by: the subdued performance of the e-vapor category; less out-switching to fine cut products; a reduction in the consumption of illicit products in several markets; and lower than historical average pricing, mainly in Italy.

The total OTP market in the EU of 164.6 billion cigarette equivalent units increased by 1.1%, reflecting a larger total fine cut market, up by 0.9% to 143.1 billion cigarette equivalent units.

The total cigarette market in the EU of 114.6 billion units decreased by 2.4% reflecting, in certain key geographies, moderating total market declines compared to the same period in 2013, resulting from a deceleration in the growth of the e-vapor category, and a moderation in the level of illicit trade.
