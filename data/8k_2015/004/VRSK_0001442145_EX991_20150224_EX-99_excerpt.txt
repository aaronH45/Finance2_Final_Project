“We were very pleased to have returned capital to our shareholders in 2014 through share repurchases, including through the special accelerated share repurchase in December. We made several small acquisitions in 2014 related to our insurance, financial and emerging supply chain businesses and have ample capacity and interest in continuing our disciplined M&A agenda in addition to our organic growth opportunities,” concluded Stephenson.

Notes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

5

The company has provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP measures, such as EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS, provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the company’s management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the company and for budgeting and planning purposes.

Table 4 below sets forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA from continuing operations based on our historical results:

Table 4: EBITDA from Continuing Operations Reconciliation

(in thousands)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

EBITDA is a financial measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments. In all periods shown here and going forward, the company defines “EBITDA” as net income before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.

Although EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in their evaluation of companies, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our statement of cash flow reported under U.S. GAAP. Management uses EBITDA in conjunction with traditional U.S. GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance. Some of these limitations are as follows:

•EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.

•EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirement for, our working capital needs.

•Although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

•Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of their calculations as comparative measures.

Table 5, below, sets forth a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations to adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS from continuing operations:
