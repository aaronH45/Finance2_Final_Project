On January 20, 2015, at a meeting of the special committee of the board of directors of GFI Group Inc.

(“CME Group”) and GFI Group discussed in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (the “GFI Merger”) was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of GFI Group common stock (other than holders of shares of GFI Group common stock beneficially owned by stockholders and certain affiliates of Jersey Partners, Inc.). The consent of Greenhill is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 99.1.

Skadden’s tax opinion is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 8.1.
