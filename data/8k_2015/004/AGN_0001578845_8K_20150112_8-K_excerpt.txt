 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On January 12, 2015, Actavis plc (“Actavis”) and Allergan, Inc. (“Allergan”) issued a joint press release to announce that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), with respect to Actavis’ pending acquisition of Allergan. On December 1, 2014, Actavis and Allegan filed Pre-Merger Notification and Report Forms required under the HSR Act with the FTC. On December 29, 2014, Actavis voluntarily withdrew and subsequently re-filed these forms. The early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act satisfies one of the conditions to the closing of the pending acquisition, which remains subject to other customary closing conditions, including receipt of shareholder and other regulatory approvals.  

In the same press release, Actavis and Allergan also announced that they have set the close of business on January 22, 2015 as the record date for determining the shareholders that will be entitled to vote at their respective special meetings of shareholders to be held in connection with the pending acquisition. The date, time and location of each company’s special meeting will be set and announced at a later time.  

A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
