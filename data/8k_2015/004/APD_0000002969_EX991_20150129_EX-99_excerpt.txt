Air Products Reports Strong First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Results  

   •    Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.55*, up 16 percent* versus prior year and above guidance range  

   •    Adjusted EBITDA up 10 percent* versus prior year  

   •    Strong performance driven by lower costs and improvement in volumes and price  

   •    New organizational structure in place and delivering results  

   •    GAAP EPS of $1.50 versus prior year of $1.34  

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 29, 2015) – Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $335 million*, up 17 percent* versus prior year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.55*, up 16 percent* versus prior year, on a non-GAAP continuing operations basis for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2014.  

On a GAAP basis, net income and diluted EPS from continuing operations were $325 million and $1.50, respectively, for the quarter.  

*The results and guidance in this release, unless otherwise indicated, are based on non-GAAP continuing operations. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found at the end of this release.  

First quarter sales of $2,561 million increased one percent versus prior year, as higher volumes and pricing were largely offset by unfavorable currency impacts and the exit from the Polyurethane Intermediates Business (PUI). Excluding these impacts, underlying sales increased five percent on four percent higher volumes with strength across most of the segments. Sequentially, sales declined four percent on lower seasonal volumes and unfavorable currency impacts.  

Operating income of $445 million increased 15 percent versus prior year as higher volumes, favorable cost performance, and stronger pricing more than offset unfavorable currency impacts. Operating margin of 17.4 percent improved 230 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA of $723 million increased 10 percent, and EBITDA margin of 28.2 percent improved 240 basis points over prior year. Sequentially, operating income declined six percent, mainly due to lower seasonal volumes and unfavorable currency impacts.  

Commenting on the quarter, Seifi Ghasemi, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, “We started fiscal 2015 strong, delivering double-digit EBITDA and earnings growth. These results clearly demonstrate our people’s focus on safety, cost, and serving our customers in the new organization. Despite economic uncertainty, we are greatly encouraged by these results, and the team is focused on the actions we can control to deliver on our commitments.”

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(Millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for share data)  

The discussion of first quarter results includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP Capital Expenditures. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which our management uses internally to evaluate our operating performance and manage our capital expenditures. Definitions of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures.  

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

 (A)   Noncontrolling interests impact of $33.7 and tax impact of $1.3.

ADJUSTED EBITDA  

We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of ongoing business trends, plus interest expense, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful operational metric.  

Below is a reconciliation from Income from Continuing Operations to Adjusted EBITDA.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  

We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and is reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.  

Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

(Unaudited)  

(Millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated)  

1. BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING  

On 18 September 2014, we announced plans to reorganize the Company, including realignment of our businesses in new reporting segments and other organizational changes, effective as of 1 October 2014. As a result of this reorganization, we will incur ongoing severance and other charges. In the first quarter of 2015, we recognized an expense of $32.4 ($21.7 after-tax, or $.10 per share) relating to the elimination of approximately 450 positions. During the fourth quarter of 2014, an expense of $12.7 ($8.2 after-tax, or $.04 per share) was incurred relating to the elimination of approximately 50 positions. Additional charges will be recorded in future periods as the Company commits to specific actions.  

2. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION  

Effective 1 October 2014, we began operating under a new structure and reporting our results under the following seven new segments:  

   •    Industrial Gases – Americas  

   •    Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa)  

   •    Industrial Gases – Asia  

   •    Industrial Gases – Global  

   •    Materials Technologies  

   •    Energy-from-Waste  

   •    Corporate and other  

Each of the three regional Industrial Gases segments (Americas, EMEA, Asia) includes, with respect to such region, onsite Air Separation Units (ASUs producing primarily oxygen, nitrogen and argon), Hydrogen/HyCO Plants (producing primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide, syngas and steam), and the regional Merchant Gases businesses (including liquid/bulk, packaged gases and related equipment). The Industrial Gases – Global segment includes atmospheric sale of equipment businesses, such as ASUs and noncryogenic generators, as well as global resources associated with the Industrial Gases business. The Materials Technologies segment includes the Electronics Materials and Performance Materials businesses, but excludes the previous Electronics tonnage gases business which is now part of the three regional Industrial Gases segments. The Energy-from-Waste segment consists of the Tees Valley projects in the United Kingdom. The Corporate and other segment includes two on-going global businesses (our liquefied natural gas, or LNG, sale of equipment business and our helium storage and distribution vessel sale of equipment business), the polyurethane intermediates business that was exited in early fiscal year 2014, and corporate support functions that benefit all of the business segments. Support functions that support a specific business are allocated directly to the related segment.  

Prior year information conforms with the fiscal year 2015 presentation. For additional historical financial information comparable to the 2015 presentation, see our Form 8-K filed on 5 January 2015.  

3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  

On 30 December 2014, we acquired our partner’s equity ownership interest in a liquefied industrial gases production joint venture in North America for $22.6, which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and subsequent to the acquisition, the results are consolidated within our Industrial Gases – Americas segment. The assets acquired, primarily plant and equipment, were recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisition date.  

The acquisition date fair value of the previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis under the income approach. The three months ended 31 December 2014 include a gain of $17.9 ($11.2 after-tax, or $.05 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair value as of the acquisition date. This gain is reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Gain on previously held equity interest.”
