On January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company elected Randall D. Ledford, 65, as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. Mr. Ledford most recently served as Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Emerson Electric Company, and also as President of Emerson Venture Capital. He was employed by Emerson from 1997 until his retirement in September 2014. From 1980 to 1997, Mr. Ledford was employed in many roles at Texas Instruments, including as president and general manager of several different divisions. Mr. Ledford will receive cash and equity compensation as a non-employee director in accordance with the Company’s non-employee director compensation practices and plans described in the Company’s 2014 Proxy Statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 28, 2014. Under the 2012 Restricted Stock Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation, Mr. Ledford will receive an interim grant of restricted shares. This grant will be prorated from the date of his appointment to the Board of Directors until the Company’s next annual stockholders meeting. Mr. Ledford has not yet been appointed to serve on any committees of the Board. There are no transactions between Mr. Ledford and the Company that would be reportable under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. A copy of Amphenol Corporation’s related press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
