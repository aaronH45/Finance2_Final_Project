Energy Loan Portfolio 11 Key Takeaways • $3.2 billion of outstanding balances at December 31, 2014 • 8% of total loans • Diversified portfolio, primarily upstream / midstream / services (see slide 12) • No junior or second liens • Very modest growth in 2014 • Internal concentration limits result in more measured growth • Conservative underwriting results in measured growth • Underwriting of upstream includes several risk mitigants (see slides 13 - 15) • Underwriting of Energy Service portfolio includes low leverage and strong, stable equity sponsors (see slide 16) • Balanced production between oil and gas • Hedging used by borrowers: more than 50% of oil production for both 2015 and 2016 is hedged • Internal sensitivity analysis uses prices of mid-$50s for 8 quarters • Less than 1% peak annual energy loan losses in the wake of the last large energy commodity price decline Source: Company Documents

Conservative Underwriting: What We Do, and What We Avoid 13 Source: Company Documents What We Do: • Upstream lending – multiple “haircuts” on oil / gas values and commodity prices to arrive at borrowing base (loan commitment amount) • Semi-annual borrowing base redeterminations and sensitivity testing to ensure proper equity cushion throughout the life of the loan • Energy services loans generally have limited leverage ratios • Sponsors are frequently long-standing, dedicated private equity firms, not generalists PE firms that may not fully understand the risks What We Avoid: • Borrowers who employ too much leverage, even if much of the debt is subordinate to ours • Borrowers with complex equity structures, especially where competing interests among equity groups/classes could delay or derail additional capital infusions • Management teams that are inexperienced and/or unproven • Energy service companies in the most cyclically sensitive parts of the industry: seismic companies, small independent drilling contractors and saltwater disposal services

Upstream (Reserve-Based) Underwriting 15 Typical Oil & Gas Reserve-Based Loan $100 - Present value of oil & gas reserves using current NYMEX oil and gas prices $ 85 - Zions’ risk-adjusted value of reserves (e.g. Zions applies discounts to non-producing reserves) $ 77 - Apply “bank price deck” (generally ~90% of NYMEX) to determine collateral value. $ 54 - Loan commitment amount (30% haircut if 25%+ of reserves are hedged) $ 46 - Loan commitment amount (40% haircut if less than 25% hedging) Notes: • Collateral value is based on engineering firm assessment of oil/gas reserves. For lending purposes, no more than 25% of the collateral may be comprised of non-producing reserves. Cash flows from the reserves are calculated by employing engineer’s projected volumes, bank oil/gas price deck and actual operating costs, then converted to present value using a 9% discount rate. • Utilization rate typically runs near 50% on the loan commitment amount. Expect utilization rates to rise as commitments are reduced due to borrowing base redeterminations. Source: Company Documents In millions  

Energy Services – Key Credit Metrics 16 How We Mitigate Risk in Energy Service Lending • Conservative Capital Structures • Senior Debt / EBITDA: Generally in the 1.5-to-1 area • Average Debt / Capitalization: less than 50% • Strong sponsorship / access to capital • Private Equity firms sponsor a large portion of the energy loan portfolio; PE firms are typically dedicated to the energy industry, rather than generalists. • Dedicated PE sponsors: ~80% of total sponsors • Generalist PE sponsors: all have a significant amount of capital committed to the energy industry • Large portion of portfolio consists of publicly traded companies with strong balance sheets and access to multiple sources of capital • Geographically diversified client base with operations across most major basins • Most borrowers have significant operations in both oil and gas basins • Private companies without equity sponsors are typically very well capitalized with strong management teams (many have personal recourse or sponsorship from high net worth families) Source: Company Documents

One-Year Outlook Summary Relative to 4Q14 Results Topic Outlook Comment Loan Balances Slightly to Moderately Increasing • Prepayments remain volatile, making net loan growth difficult to forecast. • Line utilization rates likely to increase on energy portfolio, generally due to reducing commitments. Net Interest Income Moderately Increasing • Driven primarily by debt reduction late in 2H15 • Deploying ~$150 million per month of cash into short-to- medium duration (~3.5 years), HQLA-qualifying agency MBS Provisions Positive • Provisions likely to be positive throughout 2015, reflecting net charge-offs, loan growth, and expected downgrades of energy-related loans due to the decline in energy commodity prices. Fee Income Increasing • Fee income initiatives likely to result in moderate increase, excluding securities gains/losses. Noninterest Expense Stable • Elevated spending on technology systems overhaul to continue throughout 2015, but at substantially similar levels as 4Q14 results. • Expected declines in professional services expenses to offset seasonal increases from payroll taxes, etc. 29
