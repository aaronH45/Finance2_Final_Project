PHILADELPHIA – February 24, 2015… Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA, CMCSK) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. 

Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Comcast Corporation, said, “2014 was a great year financially, operationally, and strategically for Comcast NBCUniversal. We continued to execute incredibly well as we accelerated our innovation, launched new products, and brought amazing films, shows and theme park attractions to consumers. Cable’s results, driven by High-Speed Internet and Business Services, demonstrate our focus on driving profitable growth and technology innovations, including our transformative X1 platform. This is bearing fruit in our operating performance, as we added 358,000 customer relationships, while video subscriber trends were the best in 7 years and in broadband we added over 1 million subscribers for the ninth year in a row. NBCUniversal also had a standout performance in 2014, with 18% growth in operating cash flow, driven by a successful Sochi Olympics, continued momentum at NBC Broadcast, the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter ™- Diagon Alley ™ in Orlando, and strong box office performance from Universal Pictures. We enter 2015 with great momentum and significant opportunities ahead, and we look forward to receiving regulatory approval for the Time Warner Cable merger. Underscoring our confidence in the continued success of our company, we are increasing our dividend to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis, marking the seventh consecutive annual increase, and plan to repurchase at least $4.25 billion of our stock this year.”

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased 3.8% to $8.2 billion compared to $8.5 billion in 2013, reflecting increased capital expenditures and cash taxes on operating items, as well as increased working capital, mainly driven by higher film and TV production spend, partially offset by growth in consolidated operating cash flow.

Cable Communications [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenue for Cable Communications increased 6.1% to $11.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $10.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by increases of 9.9% in high-speed Internet and 20.8% in business services. Advertising revenue increased 18.9%, reflecting higher political advertising in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in Cable revenue reflects increased customer relationships (see below), customers receiving higher levels of service, customers taking additional services, as well as rate adjustments. 

For the year ended December 31, 2014, Cable revenue increased 5.5% to $44.1 billion compared to $41.8 billion in 2013, driven by growth in high-speed Internet, business services and advertising.

Customer relationships increased by 178,000 to 27.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 47% improvement compared to an increase of 121,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Video customer net losses improved year-over-year and were the best result in seven years. High-speed Internet customer net additions of 1.3 million marked the ninth consecutive year of more than one million net additions. Voice net additions slowed, reflecting X1 availability that was more focused on triple play customers last year, making for a difficult comparison. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Cash Flow for Cable Communications increased 6.3% to $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by a 6.0% increase in operating expenses primarily related to higher video programming costs.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

4 

Revenue for NBCUniversal increased 2.3% to $6.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013, as revenue growth in Theme Parks and Broadcast Television was partially offset by lower Filmed Entertainment revenue driven by a year-over-year decline in home entertainment revenue. Operating Cash Flow increased 6.6% to $1.4 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by strong results at Theme Parks and Broadcast Television. 

For the year ended December 31, 2014, NBCUniversal revenue increased 7.5% to $25.4 billion compared to $23.7 billion in 2013. Excluding $1.1 billion of revenue generated by the Sochi Olympics in the first quarter of 2014, revenue increased 2.9%. Operating cash flow increased 18.1% to $5.6 billion compared to $4.7 billion in 2013. Excluding $130 million of operating cash flow generated by the Olympics, operating cash flow increased 15.3%, reflecting solid results at each business segment (see Table 5). 

Cable Networks 

For the fourth quarter of 2014, revenue from the Cable Networks segment was stable at $2.3 billion and operating cash flow decreased 1.8% to $912 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. These results reflect a 5.6% decline in advertising revenue along with a slight increase in operating costs driven by investment in programming, which more than offset a 4.6% increase in distribution revenue. 

For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenue from the Cable Networks segment increased 3.9% to $9.6 billion compared to $9.2 billion in 2013. Excluding $257 million of revenue generated by the 2014 Sochi Olympics, revenue increased 1.1%, reflecting a 4.6% increase in distribution revenue, partially offset by a 3.5% decrease in advertising revenue. Operating cash flow increased 2.5% to $3.6 billion compared to $3.5 billion in 2013. Excluding the Olympics, operating cash flow increased 2.2%, reflecting higher revenue and flat operating costs, even as we continue to invest in programming (see Table 5). 

Broadcast Television 

For the fourth quarter of 2014, revenue from the Broadcast Television segment increased 4.8% to $2.3 billion compared to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by a 3.1% increase in advertising revenue, as well as higher retransmission consent fees. Operating cash flow increased 64.0% to $230 million compared to $140 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting higher revenue, which more than offset a slight increase in operating costs and expenses. 

For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenue from the Broadcast Television segment increased 20.0% to $8.5 billion compared to $7.1 billion in 2013. Excluding $846 million of revenue generated by the 2014 Sochi Olympics, revenue increased 8.1%, reflecting higher advertising revenue and retransmission consent fees. Operating cash flow increased $389 million to $734 million compared to $345 million in 2013. Excluding the Olympics, operating cash flow increased $272 million, or 78.6%, reflecting higher revenue and a modest increase in operating costs and expenses (see Table 5). 

Filmed Entertainment 

For the fourth quarter of 2014, revenue from the Filmed Entertainment segment decreased 10.6% to $1.3 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting a decline in home entertainment revenue primarily due to the strong performance of Despicable Me 2 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Operating cash flow decreased $115 million to $77 million compared to $192 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting lower revenue, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of film costs. 

For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenue from the Filmed Entertainment segment decreased 8.2% to $5.0 billion compared to $5.5 billion in 2013, reflecting lower theatrical and home entertainment revenue, primarily due to the strong performances of Despicable Me 2 and Fast and Furious 6 in 2013. Operating cash flow increased $228 million to $711 million compared to $483 million in 2013, as lower revenues were more than offset by a decrease in the amortization of film costs and reduced advertising, marketing and promotion expense due to a reduced film slate. 

Theme Parks 

For the fourth quarter of 2014, revenue from the Theme Parks segment increased 29.9% to $735 million compared to $566 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting higher guest attendance and per capita spending, driven by the continued success of Orlando’s The Wizarding World of Harry Potter™ – Diagon Alley™, as well as Halloween Horror Nights at the Orlando and Hollywood parks. Fourth quarter operating cash flow increased 37.6% to $352 million compared to $257 million in the same period last year, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating costs to support the new attractions. 

5 

For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenue from the Theme Parks segment increased 17.3% to $2.6 billion compared to $2.2 billion in 2013.

Notes:  

1 We define Operating Cash Flow as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of assets, if any. 

2 Earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. 

3 We define Free Cash Flow as Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and cash distributions to noncontrolling interests; and adjusted for any payments and receipts related to certain nonoperating items, net of estimated tax effects. The definition of Free Cash Flow excludes any impact from Economic Stimulus packages. These amounts have been excluded from Free Cash Flow to provide an appropriate comparison. 

4 Beginning in 2014, our Cable Communications segment revised its methodology for counting customers related to how we count and report customers who reside in multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”) that are billed under bulk contracts (the “Billable Customers Method”). For MDUs whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services, such as additional programming choices or our HD or DVR services, we now count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services, the MDU is now counted as a single customer. Previously, we had counted and reported these customers on an equivalent billing unit basis by dividing monthly revenue received under an MDU’s bulk contract by the standard monthly residential rate where the MDU was located (the “EBU Method”). Video customer metrics for 2013 are now presented on the Billable Customers Method to provide an appropriate comparison. For high-speed Internet and voice customers, the differences in the customer metrics using the Billable Customers Method and the EBU Method were not material and 2013 data has not been adjusted. 

All percentages are calculated on whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding.

(1) Nonoperating items include adjustments for cash taxes paid related to certain investing and financing transactions, to reflect cash taxes paid in the year of the related taxable income and to exclude the impacts of Economic Stimulus packages. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 includes a $150 million increase in July 2014 resulting from a change in our credit card payment processes that resulted in the acceleration of the recognition of cash receipts in Cable Communications. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 includes $1.4 billion of cash payments associated with the termination in December 2013 of NBCUniversal’s receivables monetization programs. For free cash flow purposes, we consider the acceleration to be nonrecurring in nature and the termination to be similar to a financing transaction and therefore, we excluded these amounts from free cash flow as nonoperating items.
