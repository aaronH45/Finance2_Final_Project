Item 8.01. Other Events  

On January 15, 2015, CME Group Inc. (“CME Group”) and GFI Group Inc. (“GFI Group”) issued a joint press release announcing that they had entered into amendment agreements to amend the definitive agreements (the “Transaction Amendments”) providing for the previously announced transaction through which, among other things, CME Group will acquire GFI Group’s Trayport and FENICS businesses by first acquiring GFI Group and immediately thereafter a private consortium of GFI Group management will acquire GFI Group’s wholesale brokerage business.  

Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Amendments, the consideration payable to GFI Group stockholders has increased from $5.25 per share in CME Group stock to $5.60 per share, payable in a mix of shares of CME Group Class A common stock and cash, and the purchase price for GFI Group’s wholesale brokerage business has increased from $254 million to approximately $281.8 million, plus the assumption, at closing, of certain liabilities. Also pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Amendments, the shares held by Messrs. Gooch, Heffron and Brown through Jersey Partners Inc. will not share in the $0.35 per share increase and will only receive $5.25 per share.  

A copy of the joint press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
