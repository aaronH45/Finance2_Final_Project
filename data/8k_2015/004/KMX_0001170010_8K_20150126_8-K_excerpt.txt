 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

The Compensation and Personnel Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) of CarMax, Inc. (the “Company”) approved amendments to the Company’s form of notice of stock option grant (the “Option Agreement”) and form of notice of market stock unit grant (the “MSU Agreement”) at its January 26, 2015 meeting. The amendments contained in each of the Option Agreement and the MSU Agreement address vesting of these equity awards upon an associate’s termination from the Company without cause or by the associate for good reason (the “separation events”). Options issued under the Option Agreement will terminate if they are not vested at the time of the separation events. Market stock units issued under the MSU Agreement will vest on a pro rata basis at the time of a separation event, depending on the portion of the three year vesting term elapsed.  

The Committee also approved a form of notice of performance stock unit grant (the “PSU Agreement”) under the CarMax, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan. The PSU Agreement may be used by the Committee to grant stock-settled restricted stock units, where vesting of the units is contingent on, among other things, the achievement of performance goals set by the Committee.  

Copies of the Option Agreement, the MSU Agreement and the PSU Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated by reference into this Item 8.01.
