Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On January 6, 2015, eBay Inc. (the "Company") announced that Bonnie Hammer had been appointed as a new member of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). A copy of the Company's press release announcing Ms. Hammer's appointment is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. 

Ms. Hammer's term on the Board began on January 6, 2015. Ms. Hammer fills a vacancy created by an increase in the size of the Board from 11 to 12, and her term of office will expire at the Company's 2015 annual meeting of stockholders or until her successor has been elected and qualified.

As a non-employee director, Ms. Hammer is entitled to receive: (i) an annual cash retainer of $80,000, pro-rated for the remaining portion of 2015, and (ii) $220,000 in deferred stock units ("DSUs"), representing an unfunded, unsecured right to receive shares of eBay common stock, at the time of each annual meeting of stockholders, with such annual equity grants vesting as to 100% of the DSUs on the first anniversary of the date of grant.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year

On January 7, 2015, the Board amended the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) to clarify, for the elimination of doubt, that provisions of the Bylaws concerning a stockholder’s duty to update and supplement a notice of business or director nomination proposed to be brought before a stockholder meeting to ensure the notice is true and correct as of the record date and as of ten business days prior to the meeting do not operate to extend applicable deadlines, cure deficiencies or otherwise enable stockholder business or nominations to be changed. These amendments to the Bylaws were effective immediately upon adoption by the Board.

A copy of the Company’s Bylaws, adopted and effective as of January 7, 2015, is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and is incorporated in response to this Item by reference thereto. The full text of the Bylaws, marked to show the change, is attached as Exhibit 3.2 to this report and is incorporated in response to this Item by reference thereto.
