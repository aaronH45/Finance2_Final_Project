Management Commentary 

“2014 was a banner year for CBRE,” said Bob Sulentic, the company’s president and chief executive officer. “We generated strong growth and reached new milestones for total revenue and EBITDA. We achieved these results by investing in our professionals and platform, as our people worked together to create distinct advantages for our clients. Importantly, for the full year, our regional services businesses, together, achieved significant operating leverage before the contributions from Norland. In the fourth quarter, our people drove continued strong gains in our global leasing, occupier outsourcing and capital markets business lines as well as in our U.S. real estate development services business.” 

For the quarter, revenue rose significantly in all three global regions. The Americas, CBRE’s largest business segment, saw a 19% (20% in local currency) revenue increase, as every major business line produced double-digit growth. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), organic revenue improved 16% (23% in local currency), or 71% (78% in local currency) including the contributions from Norland Managed Services Ltd, which CBRE acquired in December 2013. Asia Pacific posted revenue growth of 8% (14% in local currency), fueled by notable strength in Australia, India and Japan. 

Among global business lines, revenue growth was paced by property leasing, which logged its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue increases. Globally, this business line saw revenue rise by 20% (23% in local currency) during the fourth quarter. This result reflects investments in growth initiatives as well as better underlying market conditions. 

The strong growth of CBRE’s occupier outsourcing business continued in the fourth quarter. The company signed outsourcing contracts with 37 new customers – the most ever for a single quarter – reflecting its success at delivering integrated, value-added solutions for major occupiers. Globally, revenue from occupier outsourcing, including related transaction revenues, improved 59% (60% in local currency), or 17% (19% in local currency) without the contributions from Norland, during the fourth quarter.

Global property sales revenue improved 14% (17% in local currency) in the fourth quarter, with increases of 20% or more in the United States, France and Spain. Global commercial mortgage services revenue increased robustly, rising 34% (35% in local currency) in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued strong capital flows into commercial real estate as well as the company’s efforts to expand this service offering outside the U.S. 

The Development Services business continued to perform exceptionally well during the quarter, with revenue improving 32% (same in local currency). 

As expected, Global Investment Management revenue declined during the quarter. The 26% (24% in local currency) decrease was primarily due to significantly higher carried-interest revenue in last year’s fourth quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Carried interest is performance-based revenue that is generated when CBRE sells assets within its investment portfolios at values that exceed specified return thresholds. Capital raising activity in the Global Investment Management business remained strong, totaling approximately $8.6 billion for the full year. 

During the fourth quarter, Standard & Poor’s raised CBRE’s corporate rating to Investment Grade. CBRE has taken advantage of liquidity and low interest rates in the debt markets to optimize the strength and flexibility of its balance sheet. In December 2014, the company issued $125 million of senior notes due 2025, following an earlier offering of $300 million of the same series of notes in September 2014. In January 2015, CBRE closed on an expanded $2.6 billion, five-year revolving credit facility and $500 million Tranche A term loan facility. The company used the proceeds from the new term loan and the December 2014 notes offering, along with cash on hand, to pay off the balances on its shorter-maturity, higher-interest rate term loans and the outstanding balance of approximately $5 million on its prior revolving credit facility. 

Fourth-Quarter 2014 Segment Results 

Americas Region (U.S., Canada and Latin America) 

  ·   Revenue rose 19% (20% in local currency) to $1.62 billion, compared with $1.36 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013. The revenue growth was driven by higher property sales, leasing, occupier outsourcing and commercial mortgage services activities.   

  ·   EBITDA increased 21% to $242.9 million compared with $201.3 million in last year’s fourth quarter.   

  ·   Operating income totaled $194.6 million, an increase of 18% from $165.3 million for the prior-year fourth quarter.    

EMEA Region (primarily Europe) 

  ·   Revenue rose 71% (78% in local currency) to $740.1 million, compared with $432.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding the contributions from Norland, EMEA revenue increased 16% (23% in local currency) over the prior-year period. The increase was driven by higher property sales, leasing and appraisal activities as well as strong organic growth in occupier outsourcing. The company achieved significant improvement in several countries, including Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.

  ·   EBITDA increased 66% to $70.2 million compared with $42.3 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. The prior-year quarter was impacted by selected charges totaling $13.7 million for integration and other costs related to acquisitions, primarily Norland, as well as cost containment expenses, which did not recur in the fourth quarter of 2014.   

  ·   Operating income totaled $54.3 million, an increase of 54% from $35.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. Prior-year operating income was impacted by the same selected charges that impacted EBITDA.    

Asia Pacific Region (Asia, Australia and New Zealand) 

  ·   Revenue was $277.2 million, an increase of 8% (14% in local currency) from $255.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. Performance improved in several countries, particularly Australia, India and Japan.   

  ·   EBITDA increased 28% to $33.1 million compared with $25.9 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. The prior-year period was impacted by selected charges totaling $4.3 million related to cost containment and acquisition-related integration expenses, which did not recur in the fourth quarter of 2014.   

  ·   Operating income totaled $29.1 million, an increase of 32% compared with $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Prior-year operating income was impacted by the same selected charges that impacted EBITDA.    

Global Investment Management (investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific) 

  ·   Revenue totaled $125.2 million compared with $168.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was largely driven by the decline in carried-interest revenue.   

  ·   Excluding selected charges, EBITDA totaled $29.2 million compared with $82.2 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. EBITDA (including selected items) totaled $8.7 million compared with $66.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. These results include the impact of carried interest described above.   

  ·   Prior-year period results included $58.4 million of normalized EBITDA associated with carried interest while fourth-quarter 2014 results included $11.7 million of normalized EBITDA associated with carried interest.   

  ·   Operating income was $4.4 million compared with an operating loss of $45.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.   

  ·   Assets Under Management increased during the quarter by $3.8 billion in local currency - offset by $1.8 billion of exchange rate impact - to $90.6 billion, driven by strong acquisition activity and higher property and securities values.    

Development Services (real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S.) 

  ·   Revenue rose 32% to $24.3 million, compared with $18.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.    

CBRE Press Release 

February 4, 2015

  ·   EBITDA increased 70% to $37.0 million compared with $21.8 million in the prior-year period. The increase was largely driven by higher income from property sales (reflected primarily in gain on disposition of real estate) in the fourth quarter of 2014.   

  ·   Operating income totaled $6.3 million compared with an operating loss of $8.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. Under U.S. GAAP, equity earnings are not included in the calculation of operating income. If equity earnings were included, operating income would have totaled $34.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $19.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.   

  ·   Development projects in process totaled $5.4 billion, up $300 million from third-quarter 2014, and the inventory of pipeline deals totaled $4.0 billion, up $1.1 billion from third-quarter 2014. Most of the pipeline increase is due to fee-development work in the health care sector.    

Business Outlook 

“By any measure, 2014 was an excellent year for CBRE, and we believe 2015 will be another year of strong growth,” Mr. Sulentic said. “The investments we’ve made in our people and operating platform have materially strengthened our global business lines and positioned them for further market share gains by delivering enhanced value to our clients.” 

In light of its outlook for its business performance in 2015, CBRE expects to achieve earnings-per-share, as adjusted, in the range of $1.90 to $1.95 for the full year.

Note – CBRE has not reconciled the non-GAAP earnings per share guidance included in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort. 

1 Selected charges included the write-off of financing costs, amortization expense related to certain intangible assets attributable to acquisitions, certain carried-interest incentive compensation expense, the impairment of non-amortizable intangible assets, integration and other costs related to acquisitions and cost containment expenses. For the impact of selected charges on specific periods, see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this press release. 

2 A reconciliation of net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. to net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., as adjusted for selected charges, is provided in the section of this press release entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

3 EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while amounts shown for EBITDA, as adjusted (or normalized EBITDA), remove the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, certain carried-interest incentive compensation expense, asset impairments and cost containment initiatives. Our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. As a result, our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs. Additionally, we believe EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations. 

However, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not recognized measurements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. 

For a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, to net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
