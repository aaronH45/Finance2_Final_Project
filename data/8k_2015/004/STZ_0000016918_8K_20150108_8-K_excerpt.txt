Item 2.02.Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On January 8, 2015, Constellation Brands, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, issued a news release (the “release”) announcing its financial condition and results of operations as of and for the third quarter ended November 30, 2014. A copy of the release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The projections constituting the guidance included in the release involve risks and uncertainties, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at this time; therefore, actual results may vary materially from these forecasts. In this regard, see the information included in the release under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements.”

The information in the release is “furnished” and not “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such information may be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933 only if and to the extent such subsequent filing specifically references the information incorporated by reference herein.

The release contains non-GAAP financial measures; in the release these are referred to as “comparable,” “organic” or “constant currency” measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant’s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided reconciliations within the release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Comparable measures, organic net sales measures and constant currency measures are provided because management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the results and underlying business trends of the continuing operations of the Company and/or in internal goal setting. In addition, the Company believes this information provides investors better insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year-over-year financial performance. As such, the following items, including any related income tax effect, are excluded from comparable results, when appropriate: costs associated with a voluntary product recall of select packages in the U.S. and Guam containing 12-ounce clear glass bottles of Corona Extra beer that may contain small particles of glass; net loss (gain) on the mark to fair value of undesignated commodity swap contracts; settlements of undesignated commodity swap contracts; transaction, integration and other related costs recognized in connection with acquisitions; loss on certain assets in connection with an earthquake in Napa, California; flow through of inventory step-up associated with acquisitions; prior period adjustment for deferred compensation related to certain employment agreements; restructuring and related charges; certain other selling, general and administrative costs; impairments of certain intangible assets; gain on remeasurement to fair value of an equity method investment; equity method investee’s transaction costs associated with an acquisition; and loss on write-off of financing costs. On June 7, 2013, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Crown Imports LLC which it did not already own, all of the issued and outstanding interests of Compañía Cervecera de Coahuila, S. de R.L. de C.V. and of Servicios Modelo de Coahuila, S. de R.L. de C.V., and an irrevocable, fully paid license to produce in Mexico (or worldwide under certain circumstances) and exclusively import, market and sell the Mexican beer brands sold by Crown Imports LLC in the United States and Guam as of the date of the acquisition and certain extensions (collectively, the “Beer Business Acquisition”). Accordingly, during the indicated period, organic net sales measures exclude the net sales of the Beer Business Acquisition. Constant currency measures exclude the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations.
