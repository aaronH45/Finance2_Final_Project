Independent Auditors’ Report

The Board of Directors of

The Macerich Company:

We have audited the accompanying combined statements of revenues and certain expenses and the related notes (Historical Summary) of the Pacific Premier Retail LP and Queens JV LP, collectively referred to herein as the "PPRLP/Queens Portfolio" for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013.

Management's Responsibility for the Historical Summary

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the Historical Summary in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the Historical Summary that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Historical Summary based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Historical Summary is free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Historical Summary. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Historical Summary, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the Historical Summary in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical Summary. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenues and certain expenses described in note 1 of the PPRLP/Queens Portfolio for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to note 1 to the Historical Summary, which describes that the accompanying Historical Summary was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in the filing of Form 8-K/A of The Macerich Company) and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the PPRLP/Queens Portfolio’s revenues and expenses. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

The Company acquired full ownership of the PPRLP/Queens Portfolio on November 14, 2014 for a purchase price of $1,838,886.

The PPRLP/Queens Portfolio consists of the following centers:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The accompanying combined statements of revenues and certain expenses have been prepared for the purpose of complying with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the acquisition of one or more real estate properties which in aggregate are significant and, accordingly, are not representative of the actual results of operations for the periods presented. The PPRLP/Queens Portfolio is considered a group of related properties as the individual properties were acquired in a single transaction and were under common management by the Company. Therefore, combined statements of revenues and certain expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are presented. The combined statements of revenues and certain expenses exclude the following expenses which may not be comparable to the proposed future operations of the PPRLP/Queens Portfolio: 

•Depreciation and amortization, and

•Management fees.

Revenue Recognition:

Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease. Percentage rents are recognized on an accrual basis and are accrued when tenants’ specified sales targets have been met.

Estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. Other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries are recognized into revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases.

5

Management Estimates:

Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting and disclosure of revenues and certain expenses during each reporting period to prepare the statements of revenues and certain expenses in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Unaudited Interim Statement:

The statement of revenues and certain expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 is unaudited.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The interest rate disclosed represents the effective interest rate, including deferred finance costs.

(2)The monthly debt service represents the payment of principal and interest.

(3)Half of the loan proceeds were funded by Northwestern Mutual Life (“NML”), which is a joint venture partner of the Company.

The estimated fair value of mortgage notes payable at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $1,385,870 and $1,407,414, respectively, based on current interest rates for comparable loans.
