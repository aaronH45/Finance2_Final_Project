In the fourth quarter, the Company sold a 49% interest in 13th & Market, a recently completed development located in San Diego to MetLife for proceeds of $54 million. The Company recognized a gain of $7.2 million, net of tax, and generated a strong IRR on the sale. In addition, the Company sold a 50% interest in its 3033 Wilshire land parcel located in Los Angeles for $8.3 million to MetLife. Upon completion of the sale, the Company recognized a $2.2 million impairment, net of tax, which was excluded from fourth quarter and full-year 2014 FFO as Adjusted and AFFO per share. The Company can earn back this impairment if certain return hurdles on the development are met. As previously indicated, the development of 3033 Wilshire commenced in the fourth quarter.

In addition, the Company increased its ownership interest to 50% in two UDR/MetLife I joint venture land parcels located in Los Angeles for an aggregate consideration of $15 million. The developments will be constructed in 50%/50% partnerships with MetLife and are expected to commence construction in 2016.

In January, subsequent to year-end, the Company completed the sale of its 20% ownership interest in its 3,359-home Texas joint venture. At 100%, the sales price was $400 million. Total proceeds to the Company are estimated to be $43 million, inclusive of a promoted interest and fees and after debt repayment. The Company achieved a strong return on this investment, reduced its exposure to Dallas and eliminated its exposure to Houston.
