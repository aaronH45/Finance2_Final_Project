Item 8.01Other Events.

On February 23, 2015, Delphi Corporation (the “Company”), a 100% owned subsidiary of Delphi Automotive PLC (“Delphi”), announced that it intends to redeem for cash the entire $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Company’s 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). The 2021 Notes are redeemable at a redemption price that includes a make-whole premium, plus any interest accrued and unpaid to the redemption date. The redemption is expected to occur on March 25, 2015.

The redemption is conditioned upon the completion, prior to the redemption date, of a debt refinancing that would generate gross proceeds sufficient to fund the redemption. Any such financing is subject to market and other conditions.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those related to the financing and completion of the redemption and the completion of the new financing described herein. These forward-looking statements reflect, when made, Delphi's current views with respect to current events and the proposed redemption and new financing. Such forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and factors relating to Delphi's operations and business environment as well as market conditions, which may cause Delphi’s actual results to be materially different from any future results, express or implied, by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are discussed under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Delphi's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for Delphi to predict these events or how they may affect Delphi. Delphi disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events and/or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
