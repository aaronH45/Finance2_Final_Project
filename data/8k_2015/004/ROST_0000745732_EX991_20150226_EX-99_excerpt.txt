Dublin, California, February 26, 2015 -- Ross Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROST) today reported earnings per share of $1.20 for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2015, up 18% from $1.02 in the prior year. Net earnings grew to $249 million, up from $218 million for the same period last year. Sales for the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter rose 11% to $3.033 billion, with comparable store sales up 6% over the prior year.

For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, earnings per share were $4.42, up 14% from $3.88 for fiscal 2013. Net earnings rose to $925 million, compared to $837 million in the prior year. Sales for the 2014 fiscal year grew 8% to $11.042 billion, with same store sales up 3% over fiscal 2013. 

Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with our fourth quarter sales and earnings, both of which were well ahead of our expectations, as our value offering on a wide assortment of name brand bargains and gifts resonated well with our customers. Our 2014 fourth quarter operating margin grew 45 basis points to 13.1%, benefiting from slightly higher merchandise gross margin and leverage on expenses from our robust comparable sales gain.” 

Ms. Rentler continued, “For the 2014 fiscal year, our earnings per share rose a solid 14% on top of strong multi-year increases. In addition, our fiscal 2014 operating margin increased 35 basis points to 13.5%.”

New Two-Year $1.4 Billion Stock Repurchase Program and 18% Increase in Cash Dividend

The Company announced that its Board of Directors recently approved a program to repurchase $1.4 billion of its common stock over the next two years through fiscal 2016. At recent stock prices, this new authorization represents about 7% of the Company’s total market value and a 27% increase over the prior two-year $1.1 billion authorization that was completed in January 2015. 

The Board also recently approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $.235 per share, up 18% on top of an 18% increase in the prior year. This higher quarterly dividend is payable on March 31, 2015 to stockholders of record as of March 9, 2015. 

In commenting on these actions, Ms. Rentler said, “Our larger two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase authorization and increase in the quarterly cash dividend demonstrate our ongoing confidence in the Company’s ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and also raised our cash dividend annually since 1994. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns.” 

A total of 7.4 million shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2014, for an aggregate purchase price of $550 million. During the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares for a total price of $132 million.

Fiscal 2015 Guidance

Looking ahead, Ms. Rentler said, “As we enter 2015, we continue to face ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the macro-economic and retail climates. While we hope to do better, based on these external factors and our own challenging multi-year sales and earnings comparisons, we are remaining somewhat cautious in our outlook.”
