"We recently completed our all-digital transition and the rollout of our more advanced product suite, Charter Spectrum, on plan. We have now unleashed the capabilities of our high capacity two-way interactive network, freeing network capacity we can utilize for years to come," said Tom Rutledge, President and CEO of Charter Communications.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, Charter's residential customer relationships grew by 73,000, with triple play sell-in improving year-over-year, to 62% of total residential video sales. Commercial customer relationships grew by 6,000 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Residential PSUs increased by 157,000, while commercial PSUs increased 14,000 during the fourth quarter.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, Charter had completed its all-digital initiative. All-digital allows Charter to offer more advanced products and services, and provides residential customers with two-way digital set-tops, which offer higher picture quality, an interactive programming guide and video on demand on all TV outlets in the home. 

During the fourth quarter, Charter continued to introduce its new product suite, Charter Spectrum, in markets that were recently converted to all-digital. Charter customers in these markets now have access to an industry-leading suite of video, data, and voice services that includes over 200 HD channels, in addition to minimum offered Internet speeds of 60 Mbps, and a fully featured voice service, delivered at a highly competitive price. Charter Spectrum is available to new Charter customers, and to existing customers within the Company's new pricing and packaging structure launched in 2012. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, 86% of residential customers were in Charter's new pricing and packaging, excluding customers in the former Bresnan properties.

Residential video customers increased by 3,000 in the fourth quarter of 2014, versus a loss of 2,000 in the year-ago period. For the past two years Charter has significantly increased the competitiveness of its video product, by including more HD channels and video on demand offerings, attractive packaging of advanced services, improved selling methods, and enhanced service quality.

Charter added 104,000 residential Internet customers in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to 93,000 a year ago. As of December 31, 2014, 80% of Charter's residential Internet customers subscribed to tiers that provided speeds of 60 Mbps or more. The Company continues to see strong demand for its Internet service as consumers value the speed and reliability of Charter's Internet offering.

During the fourth quarter, the Company added 50,000 residential voice customers, versus a gain of 56,000 during the fourth quarter of 2013.

Fourth quarter residential revenue per customer relationship totaled $111.52, and grew by 3.1% as compared to the prior-year period, driven by rate adjustments, higher product sell-in and promotional rate step-ups, partially offset by continued single play Internet sell-in and bulk digital upgrades. In September 2014, Charter increased its broadcast TV surcharge. Excluding this rate adjustment, residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 2.2% year-over-year.

UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND OPERATING DATA

(dollars in millions, except per share data) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue

Fourth quarter 2014 revenues rose to $2.4 billion, 9.9% higher than the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by growth in Internet, video and commercial revenues. 

Video revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 8.1% compared to the prior-year period. Video revenue growth was driven by higher expanded basic and digital penetration, annual and promotional rate adjustments, higher advanced services penetration, and revenue allocation from higher bundling, partially offset by a decrease in residential limited basic video customers. 

Internet revenues grew 13.5% compared to the year-ago quarter to $670 million, driven by an increase of 383,000 Internet customers during the last year and by promotional rolloff, legacy price adjustments and revenue allocation from higher bundling. 

Voice revenues totaled $139 million, a decline of 9.7% versus the fourth quarter of 2013, due to value-based pricing and revenue allocation from higher bundling, partially offset by the addition of 166,000 voice customers in the last twelve months. 

Commercial revenues rose to $262 million, an increase of 16.1% over the prior-year period, and was driven by higher sales to small and medium business customers and to carrier customers. 

Fourth quarter advertising sales revenues of $107 million increased 28.9% compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by an increase in political advertising revenue. Excluding the benefit of political 

4

advertising revenue generated in the fourth quarter of 2014, and during the corresponding prior-year period, total fourth quarter advertising sales revenues grew by approximately 8.9% year-over-year.

Operating Costs and Expenses

Fourth quarter total operating costs and expenses increased by $131 million, or 9.6%, compared to the year-ago period, reflecting increases in programming costs, costs to service customers, and other expenses. Transition costs related to Charter's previously-announced transactions with Comcast accounted for $11 million of total fourth quarter operating costs.

Fourth quarter programming expense increased by $64 million, or 11.6%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting contractual programming increases, a 1.9% increase in expanded basic package customers over the last twelve months, broader carriage of certain networks as a result of all-digital and the introduction of new networks to Charter's video offering. Costs to service customers grew by $28 million, or 6.6% as compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven primarily by higher labor costs to deliver higher quality products and service levels, and transition expenses associated with the Comcast transactions. Other expenses grew by $37 million, or 20.4%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting higher administrative labor and commercial costs, advertising sales expenses, and transition expenses associated with the Comcast transactions. 

Adjusted EBITDA

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $845 million grew by 10.5% year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth and operating costs and expenses growth of 9.9% and 9.6%, respectively.

Net Loss

Net loss totaled $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to net income of $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter 2013 net income reflected a $36 million tax benefit related to a partnership restructuring. In addition, fourth quarter 2014 net income reflects $67 million of interest expense related to the Comcast transactions financing, $9 million of transactions costs related to the Comcast transactions in other operating expenses, and higher depreciation and amortization charges, partly offset by higher Adjusted EBITDA. Basic and diluted net loss per common share was $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to net income per basic and diluted share of $0.38 and $0.35, respectively, during the same period last year. The increase in net loss per common share was primarily the result of the factors described above.

Capital Expenditures

Property, plant and equipment expenditures were $543 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $566 million, during the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease was the result of a decline in customer premise equipment ("CPE") spending, partly offset by higher support capital expenditures. CPE spending declined versus the prior-year period as Charter completed its all-digital initiative during the fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase in support capital expenditures was driven by Charter's ongoing insourcing initiatives. Transition capital expenditures related to Charter's previously-announced transactions with Comcast accounted for $26 million of capital expenditures in the fourth quarter.

Cash Flow

During the fourth quarter of 2014, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $630 million, compared to $595 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to higher Adjusted EBITDA partly offset by higher cash interest payments, including $52 million of cash payments associated with the $7 billion of debt, proceeds of which are currently in escrow, that will be used to finance the previously-announced transactions with Comcast.

5

Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $89 million, compared to $84 million during the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher net cash flow from operating activities and lower capital expenditures, partly offset by a smaller increase in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures versus the prior-year period.

UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND OPERATING DATA

(dollars in millions, except per share data)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue

For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenues rose to $9.1 billion, 8.2% higher on a pro forma basis than in 2013, driven by continued growth in Internet, video and commercial revenues. On an actual basis, full year 2014 revenues rose 11.7% year-over-year.

Operating Costs and Expenses

Operating costs and expenses totaled $5.9 billion in 2014, an increase of $447 million, or 8.2%, on a pro forma basis compared to the year-ago period, reflecting increases in programming costs and other expenses. On an actual basis, total operating costs and expenses grew by 11.7% year-over-year. Transition costs related to the previously-announced transactions with Comcast accounted for $14 million of total 2014 operating costs. 

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 8.2% compared to 2013, on a pro forma basis. On an actual basis, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.6% compared to the year-ago period, driven by higher organic revenue growth and the acquisition of Bresnan. Charter's Adjusted EBITDA margin remained unchanged, on both a pro forma and actual basis, at 35.0%.

7

Net Loss

For the year ended December 31, 2014, net loss was $183 million, compared to $194 million on a pro forma basis, in 2013, driven by higher Adjusted EBITDA and a decline in loss on extinguishment of debt, partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization charges, higher interest expense related to the Comcast transactions financing and higher income tax expense. Net loss per common share was $1.70 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1.90 on a pro forma basis in 2013. The decrease was primarily the result of the factors described above.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2014, totaled $2.2 billion compared to pro forma capital expenditures of $1.9 billion in 2013. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by Charter's all-digital initiative, investment in CPE to support customer growth, higher product development investment and the Company's ongoing insourcing initiative. Transition capital expenditures related to Charter's previously-announced transactions with Comcast accounted for $27 million of total 2014 capital expenditures.

Charter expects 2015 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.7 billion, excluding potential expenditures related to the previously-announced transactions with Comcast. Charter expects its 2015 capital expenditures to be driven by continued growth in residential and commercial customers along with further spend related to product development. The actual amount of capital expenditures in 2015 will depend on a number of factors including the pace of transition planning to service a larger customer base upon closing of the previously-announced transactions with Comcast.

Cash Flow

In 2014, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion in 2013. The increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA partly offset by an increase in cash interest payments.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $171 million, compared to $409 million during the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to higher capital expenditures related to Charter's all-digital initiative, and expenditures related to the previously-announced Comcast transactions, including operating and other expenses, interest expense, and capital expenditures, partly offset by higher cash flow from operating activities.

Liquidity

Total principal amount of debt was approximately $21.1 billion as of December 31, 2014, including the $3.5 billion borrowed under CCO Safari Term Loan G issued in September 2014, and the $3.5 billion CCOH Safari notes issued in November 2014. Proceeds from the CCO Safari Term Loan G and CCOH Safari notes are being held in escrow and recorded as noncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2014, Charter held $3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and its credit facilities provided approximately $817 million of additional liquidity. In addition, a $500 million revolver extension is currently committed and available to Charter. The availability of this revolver is not contingent or related to the closing of the previously-announced Comcast transactions.

A slide presentation to accompany the conference call and a trending schedule containing historical customer and financial data will also be available in the “Financial Information” section.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics 

The Company uses certain measures that are not defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to evaluate various aspects of its business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net loss or cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to net income (loss) and free cash flow is reconciled to net cash flows from operating activities in the addendum of this news release. 

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net and other operating expenses, such as merger and acquisition costs, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of the Company's businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by the Company's capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and the cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures. 

Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.

Management and the Company's board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to assess Charter's performance and its ability to service its debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under the Company's credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission). For the purpose of calculating compliance 

9

with leverage covenants, we use Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. Our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees which fees were in the amount of $69 million and $54 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively and $253 million and $201 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

In addition to the actual results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we have provided pro forma results in this release for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. We believe these pro forma results facilitate meaningful analysis of the results of operations. Pro forma results in this release reflect certain acquisitions of cable systems in 2013 as if they occurred as of January 1, 2012. Pro forma statements of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 are provided in the addendum of this news release.

(a)We calculate the aging of customer accounts based on the monthly billing cycle for each account. On that basis, at December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, customers include approximately 35,100, 13,500 and 11,300 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 60 days, approximately 1,500, 1,200 and 800 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 90 days and approximately 900, 800 and 900 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 120 days. The increase in aging of customer accounts over 60 days is primarily related to a third quarter change in our collections policy consistent with broader cable industry practices.

(b)"Passings” represent our estimate of the number of units, such as single family homes, apartment and condominium units and commercial establishments passed by our cable distribution network in the areas where we offer the service indicated. These estimates are updated for all periods presented based upon the information available at that time.

(c)"Penetration" represents residential and commercial customers as a percentage of estimated passings for the service indicated.

(d)"Customer Relationships" include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing video, Internet and voice services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive. This statistic is computed in accordance with the guidelines of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association ("NCTA"). Commercial customer relationships include video customers in commercial structures, which are calculated on an EBU basis (see footnote (p)) and non-video commercial customer relationships.

(e)"Video Customers” represent those customers who subscribe to our video services. Our methodology for reporting residential video customers generally excludes units under bulk arrangements, unless those units have a digital set-top box, thus a direct billing relationship. As we complete our all-digital transition, bulk units are supplied with digital set-top boxes adding to our bulk digital upgrade customers.

(f)"Internet Customers" represent those customers who subscribe to our Internet services.

(g)"Voice Customers" represent those customers who subscribe to our voice services.

(h)"Primary Service Units" or "PSUs" represent the total of video, Internet and voice customers.

(i)"Quarterly Net Additions/(Losses)" represent the net gain or loss in the respective quarter for the service indicated.

(j)"Bulk Digital Upgrade Net Additions" represents the portion of residential video net additions that result from the addition of a digital set-top box to a bulk unit. 

(k)"Single Play Penetration" represents residential customers receiving only one Charter service offering, including video, Internet or voice, as a % of residential customer relationships.

(l)"Double Play Penetration" represents residential customers receiving only two Charter service offering, including video, Internet and/or voice, as a % of residential customer relationships.

(m)"Triple Play Penetration" represents residential customers receiving all three Charter service offerings, including video, Internet and voice, as a % of residential customer relationships.

(n)"Digital Penetration" represents the number of residential digital video customers as a percentage of residential video customers.

(o)"Monthly Residential Revenue per Residential Customer" is calculated as total residential video, Internet and voice quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average residential customer relationships during the respective quarter.

(p)Included within commercial video customers are those in commercial structures, which are calculated on an equivalent bulk unit (“EBU”) basis. We calculate EBUs by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the published rate charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. This EBU method of estimating video customers is consistent with the methodology used in determining costs paid to programmers and is consistent with the methodology used by other multiple system operators. As we increase our published video rates to residential customers without a corresponding increase in the prices charged to commercial service customers, our EBU count will decline even if there is no real loss in commercial service customers. For example, commercial video customers decreased by 18,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 due to a higher applicable video rate applied and other revisions to customer reporting methodology.
