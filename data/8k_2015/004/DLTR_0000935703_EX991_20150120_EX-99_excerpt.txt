Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Dollar Tree undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, even if experience or future changes make it clear that projected results expressed or implied in such statements will not be realized, except as may be required by law. As a result of these risks and others, actual results could vary significantly from those anticipated herein, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 

Our business strategy 

Catalyze significant white-space opportunity. Over the past decade we have built a solid and scalable infrastructure, which provides a strong foundation for our future growth. Following consummation of the Acquisition, we are committed to growing our combined business to take advantage of significant white space opportunities that we believe exist for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar store concepts. Using our proven real estate strategy across our combined business, we intend to drive future store openings by capitalizing on data-driven insights regarding location, target customer profile, competitive dynamics and cost structure. Over the long term, we believe that we can operate more than 7,000 Dollar Tree stores and 15,000 Family Dollar stores across the country. 

Recent financial performance 

The following sets forth preliminary unaudited financial information for Dollar Tree for the two fiscal month period ended January 3, 2015 and the corresponding period of the prior year. The information set forth below is subject to revision in connection with the finalization of financial statements for Dollar Tree’s fiscal year ending January 31, 2015. 

Dollar Tree 

Consolidated net sales for the two fiscal months ended January 3, 2015 increased 10.2% to $1.92 billion from $1.74 billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. Consolidated same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 5.2% compared to a 1.6% increase in the corresponding prior-year period. 

Gross profit increased 10.2% to $747.1 million from $678.1 million in the corresponding prior year period. As a percent of sales, gross margin was consistent with the corresponding prior-year period. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.9% of sales compared to 19.8% of sales in the corresponding prior year period. The results for the two fiscal month period ended January 3, 2015 included $4.8 million in Acquisition-related costs associated with the Acquisition. Excluding Acquisition-related costs, selling, general and administrative costs were 19.7% of sales, a 10 basis point improvement compared to the corresponding prior year period. The improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to leverage from the comparable store sales increase. 

Dollar Tree opened 35 stores, expanded or relocated 3 stores, and closed 3 stores during the two fiscal month period. Retail selling square footage increased to 46.1 million square feet, a 6.8% increase compared to 43.1 million as of the end of the corresponding prior year period. 

Dollar Tree’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2015 will be included in Dollar Tree’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2015, which will be filed with the SEC. The final audited consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2015 will include results for the two fiscal months ended January 3, 2015 and may vary from Dollar Tree’s expectations and may be materially different from the preliminary financial information provided above. The preliminary financial data included above has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Dollar Tree management. KPMG LLP has not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the accompanying preliminary financial data. Accordingly, KPMG LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.

Certain unaudited combined financial data 

The following certain preliminary unaudited combined financial data give effect to the Acquisition based on the assumption that the Acquisition occurred as of February 3, 2013 for the preliminary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements for the four quarters ended November 1, 2014. For purposes of preparing this data, the approximately $8,440 million of financing to be obtained by Dollar Tree in connection with the Acquisition is assumed to be financed by long-term bank debt of approximately $5,700 million, senior unsecured notes of approximately $2,500 million and revolving credit facility borrowings of approximately $240 million. As used in this excerpt, the term “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” refers to Adjusted EBITDA calculated on a pro forma basis for the Transactions, based on Dollar Tree’s Adjusted EBITDA for its historical four fiscal quarter period ended November 1, 2014 and Family Dollar’ Adjusted EBITDA for its fiscal year ended August 30, 2014. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) During the second half of fiscal 2014, Family Dollar completed a series of restructuring initiatives which included closing 377 underperforming stores and reducing expenses through workforce optimization. As a result of these initiatives, Family Dollar incurred $90.1 million of charges in fiscal 2014, consisting primarily of lease obligations, property and equipment impairments, inventory write-downs, and termination benefits. 

Certain historical consolidated financial data of Dollar Tree 

The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, for Dollar Tree as of and for the years ended February 1, 2014, February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012. Fiscal 2012 included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar, while all other fiscal years reported in the table contain 52 weeks. This information has been derived from Dollar Tree’s audited consolidated financial statements. Historical financial data as of and for the three quarters ended November 2, 2013 and November 1, 2014 have been derived from Dollar Tree’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that include, in management’s opinion, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the results of operations and financial condition of Dollar Tree for the periods and at the dates presented. The financial data for the four quarters ended November 1, 2014 were derived by adding the financial data from the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three quarters ended November 1, 2014 with the financial data from the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2014 and then deducting the financial data from the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three quarters ended November 2, 2013. Operating results for the three quarters ended November 1, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the year ending January 31, 2015.

Risk Factors 

Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings of the Acquisition may not be realized, including as a result of the challenges Family Dollar has been recently experiencing as a stand-alone company. 

Family Dollar and Dollar Tree have operated and, until the completion of the Acquisition, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Acquisition, including anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings, will depend, in part, on Dollar Tree’s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. It is possible that the pendency of the Acquisition and/or the integration process could result in the 

loss of key employees, higher than expected costs, litigation relating to the Acquisition, diversion of management attention of both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree, increased competition, the disruption of either company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Acquisition. If Dollar Tree experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Family Dollar’s first quarter of fiscal year 2015 experienced increased pressures on merchandise margin, deleveraging of expenses and increased professional fees, and such conditions may continue in the remainder of fiscal year 2015. Moreover, Family Dollar has recently experienced turnover in its corporate offices and may continue to do so during the pendency of the Acquisition and/or integration process. Each of these factors, among others, could negatively impact the actual benefits realized in the Acquisition. Furthermore, integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Acquisition on the combined company. In addition, the actual cost savings of the Acquisition could be less than anticipated. 

Lawsuits have been filed against Family Dollar, its directors, Dollar Tree and Merger Sub challenging the Acquisition, and an adverse ruling in such lawsuits may prevent the Acquisition from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe. 

Family Dollar, its directors, Dollar Tree and Merger Sub are named as defendants in three putative class action lawsuits, which have been consolidated under the caption In re Family Dollar Stores, Inc. Stockholder Litig., C.A. No. 9985 CB., brought by purported Family Dollar shareholders challenging the proposed merger, seeking, among other things, to enjoin consummation of the Acquisition. The parties conducted document discovery relating to the motion for a preliminary injunction and a hearing was held on December 5, 2014. On December 19, 2014, the Court of Chancery issued an opinion and order denying plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion. The plaintiffs sought from the Court of Chancery certification of an interlocutory appeal of that order to the Delaware Supreme Court, but on January 2, 2015, the Court of Chancery denied that request. No schedule has yet been set for the adjudication of the plaintiffs’ remaining claims for relief. If the plaintiffs are successful in their remaining claims, there could be an adverse effect on Dollar Tree and Family Dollar’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

The Acquisition 

Regulatory Approvals 

Dollar Tree and Family Dollar each submitted a filing under the HSR Act, on August 8, 2014, and each received a Second Request from the FTC regarding the Acquisition on September 8, 2014. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar certified substantial compliance with the Second Request on November 7, 2014, and October 21, 2014, respectively. The HSR Act waiting period has been extended by a timing agreement among the parties and the FTC, and Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have agreed to provide the FTC with four weeks’ notice prior to closing. Dollar Tree expects to initiate the 4-week notice period (which may be terminated early by the FTC) after Dollar Tree executes a consent decree with the FTC. 

Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have remained actively engaged with the staff of the FTC regarding its review of the Acquisition. Dollar Tree now believes that it will need to divest no more than roughly 300 stores. Dollar Tree has made a divestiture proposal and is working to reach agreement with the FTC staff regarding the specific number and location of stores for divestiture as soon as possible. The staff of the FTC has provided Dollar Tree with a preliminary number of stores—roughly 300—that appear to raise concern. Dollar Tree expects that a number of stores are likely to be removed from this set due to adjustments to account for the Dollar Tree banner’s $1 pricing model, while a small number of other stores may be added due to other competition concerns, such as the existence of Family Dollar stores that adjust prices partially based on the presence of a Dollar Tree store nearby. Although, as discussed above, the ultimate number of store divestitures that will be required to obtain FTC approval is subject to significant uncertainties, Dollar Tree management currently estimates the reasonable worst case divestiture outcome is a divestiture of roughly 300 stores and a loss of approximately $75 million in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. In parallel, Dollar Tree has identified potential divestiture buyers, expects to receive multiple initial indications of interest, and expects to present potential buyers to the FTC for approval shortly. Multiple potential buyers are conducting due diligence under non-disclosure agreements. Dollar Tree will move to secure FTC approval and finalize divestiture agreements with the selected bidder as soon as practical. 

Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information 

The preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is derived from the historical financial statements of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared using the purchase method of accounting, as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, with Dollar Tree treated as the acquirer. 

Dollar Tree, a registrant with a year that ends on the Saturday closest to January 31, acquired Family Dollar with a year that ends on the Saturday closest to August 31. The pro forma income statement for the year-ended February 1, 2014 includes (1) Dollar Tree’s year ended February 1, 2014 and (2) Family Dollar’s four quarters ended November 30, 2013. The pro forma income statement for the three quarters ended November 1, 2014 includes (1) Dollar Tree’s nine months ended November 1, 2014 and (2) Family Dollar’s three quarters ended August 30, 2014. The pro forma income statement for the four quarters ended November 1, 2014 includes (1) Dollar Tree’s four quarters ended November 1, 2014 and (2) Family Dollar’s four quarters ended August 30, 2014. 

The preliminary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet as of November 1, 2014 is presented as if the Acquisition and the estimated borrowings used to finance the Acquisition occurred on November 1, 2014. The preliminary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements for the year ended February 1, 2014 and the three and four quarters ended November 1, 2014 are presented as if the Acquisition and the related borrowings used to finance the Acquisition occurred on February 3, 2013. The preliminary pro forma adjustments reflect a preliminary exchange ratio of 0.2484 shares of Dollar Tree common stock for every share of Family Dollar common stock. 

At the effective time of the Acquisition, the cash paid, debt financing required and shares of Dollar Tree common stock issued may differ from the information in the preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information depending on the actual number of shares of Family Dollar common stock outstanding as of the Acquisition date and conditions of the debt markets. In addition, the actual allocation of the type and amount and the terms of the financing may differ from that set forth herein. 

The allocation of the purchase price used in the preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on preliminary estimates. The estimates and assumptions are subject to change at the effective time of the Acquisition. The final determination of the allocation of the purchase price will be based on the actual tangible assets and liabilities, and intangible assets of Family Dollar as of the effective time of the Acquisition. Accordingly, the final purchase accounting adjustments may be materially different from the preliminary unaudited adjustments presented herein. Acquisition-related transaction costs may also differ at the time of the Acquisition. 

The preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been compiled in a manner consistent with the accounting policies adopted by Dollar Tree. These accounting policies are similar in most material respects to those of Family Dollar. Upon completion of the acquisition, or as more information becomes available, Dollar Tree will perform a more detailed review of Family Dollar’s accounting policies. As a result of that review, differences could be identified between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when conformed, could have a material impact on the combined financial statements. 

As disclosed in Dollar Tree’s historical audited financial statements, Dollar Tree’s gross profit may not be comparable to other retailers, as some companies exclude costs related to their store occupancy and distribution network from cost of sales while others, like Dollar Tree, include all or a portion of such costs in cost of sales. As such, for income statement purposes, certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs for Family Dollar were reclassified from Family Dollar’s selling, general and administrative expenses to cost of sales to conform to Dollar Tree’s calculation of gross profit. In addition, amounts included in other income on Family Dollar’s income statement have been reclassified to selling, general and administrative expenses to conform to Dollar Tree’s presentation of these items. 

The preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of Dollar Tree that would have been reported had the Acquisition been completed as of the dates described above, and should not be taken as indicative of any future consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. The preliminary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements do not reflect any sales or cost savings from synergies that may be achieved with respect to the combined companies, or the impact of non-recurring items, including restructuring liabilities, directly related to the Acquisition. 

The preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar in Annual Reports on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar available on the SEC’s website http://www.sec.gov.

Notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information 

1. Basis of pro forma presentation 

The preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is derived from the historical financial statements of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared using the purchase method of accounting, as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, with Dollar Tree treated as the acquirer. 

Dollar Tree, a registrant with a year that ends on the Saturday closest to January 31, acquired Family Dollar with a year that ends on the Saturday closest to August 31. The pro forma income statement for the year-ended February 1, 2014 includes (1) Dollar Tree’s year ended February 1, 2014 and (2) Family Dollar’s four quarters ended November 30, 2013. The pro forma income statement for the three quarters ended November 1, 2014 includes (1) Dollar Tree’s nine months ended November 1, 2014 and (2) Family Dollar’s three quarters ended August 30, 2014. The pro forma income statement for the four quarters ended November 1, 2014 includes (1) Dollar Tree’s twelve months ended November 1, 2014 and (2) Family Dollar’s four quarters ended August 30, 2014. 

The preliminary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet as of November 1, 2014 is presented as if the Acquisition and the estimated borrowings used to finance the Acquisition occurred on November 1, 2014. The preliminary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements for the year ended February 1, 2014 and the three and four quarters ended November 1, 2014 are presented as if the Acquisition and the related borrowings used to finance the Acquisition occurred on February 3, 2013. The preliminary pro forma adjustments reflect a preliminary exchange ratio of 0.2484 shares of Dollar Tree common stock for every share of Family Dollar common stock. 

At the effective time of the Acquisition, the cash paid, debt financing required and shares of Dollar Tree common stock issued may differ from the information in the preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information depending on the actual number of shares of Family Dollar common stock outstanding as of the Acquisition date and conditions of the debt markets. In addition, the actual allocation of the type and amount and the terms of the financing may differ from that set forth herein. 

The allocation of the purchase price used in the preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on preliminary estimates. The estimates and assumptions are subject to change at the effective time of the Acquisition. The final determination of the allocation of the purchase price will be based on the actual tangible assets and liabilities, and intangible assets of Family Dollar as of the effective time of the Acquisition. Accordingly, the final purchase accounting adjustments may be materially different from the preliminary unaudited adjustments presented herein. Acquisition-related transaction costs may also differ at the time of Acquisition. 

The preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been compiled in a manner consistent with the accounting policies adopted by Dollar Tree. These accounting policies are similar in most material respects to those of Family Dollar. Upon completion of the acquisition, or as more information becomes available, Dollar Tree will perform a more detailed review of Family Dollar’s accounting policies. As a result of that review, differences could be identified between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when conformed, could have a material impact on the combined financial statements. 

Certain reclassifications have been made in the presentation reclassifications column of the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and income statements, relative to Family Dollar’s historical financial statements. These presentation reclassifications show the impact of conforming the accounting policies in order to present them on a basis consistent with those of Dollar Tree. 

Presentation reclassifications include adjustments for reclassifying Family Dollar’s accrued expenses from accounts payable to other current liabilities. Additionally, as disclosed in Dollar Tree’s historical audited financial statements, Dollar Tree’s gross profit may not be comparable to other retailers, as some companies exclude costs related to their store occupancy and distribution network from cost of sales while others, like Dollar Tree, include all or a portion of such costs in cost of sales. As such, for income statement purposes, certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs for Family Dollar were reclassified from Family Dollar’s selling, general and administrative expenses to cost of sales to conform to Dollar Tree’s calculation of gross profit. In addition, amounts included in other income on Family Dollar’s income statement have been reclassified to selling, general and administrative expenses to conform to Dollar Tree’s presentation of these items. Income taxes payable have been reclassified to income tax refund receivable as the pro forma balance is a net receivable. 

The preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of Dollar Tree that would have been reported had the Acquisition been completed as of the dates described above, and should not be taken as indicative of any future consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. The preliminary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements do not reflect any sales or cost savings from synergies that may be achieved with respect to the combined companies, or the impact of non-recurring items, including restructuring liabilities, directly related to the Acquisition. 

The preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar included in these excerpts. 

2. Purchase price 

Dollar Tree and Family Dollar entered into the Merger Agreement on July 27, 2014. The Acquisition is expected to close as early as March 2015 subject to expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

The stock price used to determine the preliminary estimated purchase price is based on the closing price of a share of Dollar Tree common stock on January 15, 2015 which was $66.41. The preliminary estimated purchase price also includes the fair value of Dollar Tree stock options that will be issued in exchange for Family Dollar’s existing stock options and other costs of the transaction. 

The calculation of the preliminary estimated purchase price is as follows: 

Calculation of shares of Dollar Tree common stock to be issued: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i) Includes 151,628 restricted shares of Family Dollar common stock that will vest at the time of the Merger and will be entitled to receive the merger consideration of $74.50 per share. 

(ii) As of January 15, 2015, Dollar Tree’s stock price of $66.41 exceeds the minimum share ratio price of $59.98 fixing the exchange ratio at 0.2484. As a result the effective consideration paid per share is $76.10.

(iii) The estimated fair value per share is based on the closing price of a share of Dollar Tree common stock as of January 15, 2015 which was $66.41. 

Stock options 

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon completion of the Acquisition the stock options outstanding under Family Dollar’s equity incentive plans will, if unvested, be reissued under an equity plan of Dollar Tree (which may include the assumed Family Dollar equity plan) and, if not exercised, will be exchanged for Dollar Tree stock options at the preliminary exchange ratio of 1.1218, which is calculated based on the closing share price for Dollar Tree common stock as of January 15, 2015. 

Dollar Tree believes the fair value of Dollar Tree stock options, adjusted for the preliminary exchange ratio, approximates the fair value of Family Dollar stock options. Accordingly, the fair value of the Family Dollar stock options was recognized as a component of purchase price and no additional amounts have been recognized as compensation expense. Dollar Tree will recalculate the fair value of the Family Dollar stock options and of the Dollar Tree options issued in exchange at the time of the Acquisition in order to determine whether any amounts should be recognized as compensation expense at the time of the Acquisition. 

Preliminary purchase price allocation 

The combined company will allocate the purchase price paid by Dollar Tree to the fair value of the Family Dollar assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The pro forma purchase price allocation below has been developed based on preliminary estimates of fair value using the historical financial statements of Family Dollar as of May 31, 2014. In addition, the allocation of the purchase price to acquired intangible assets is based on preliminary fair value estimates and is subject to final management analysis, with the assistance of third party valuation advisors, at the completion of the Acquisition. The final purchase price allocation could be impacted by a variety of factors that may become known to us only upon access to additional information and/or by changes in such factors that may occur prior to the effective time of the Acquisition. The preliminary purchase price allocation follows: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using Family Dollar’s available financial information. Except as described below, the carrying value of Family Dollar’s net assets are considered to be a proxy for the fair value of those assets and liabilities. Adjustment may be required when additional information is obtained and a more detailed review is performed of the net assets acquired. The actual amounts recorded when the Acquisition is completed may differ materially from the current book value of Family Dollar’s net assets of $1,665.7 million at August 30, 2014. 

(ii) Based on a preliminary valuation, the identifiable intangible asset consists of an indefinite-lived trade name of approximately $2,422.0 million. 

(iii) Historical non-current liabilities were increased by an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities of $926.4 million associated with the $2,422.0 million valuation of identifiable intangible assets partially reduced by $196.8 million to reflect the elimination of Family Dollar’s deferred rent balances and deferred gain as they will not be assigned value during the purchase price allocation. 

(iv) Represents addition of Family Dollar issuance discount on debt which will be assumed by Dollar Tree upon completion of the Acquisition and the write-off of deferred financing costs on Family Dollar debt to be retired in connection with the Acquisition. 

(v) Goodwill was increased by $5,362.3 million to reflect the excess of consideration paid to consummate the Acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired. 

3. Pro forma adjustments 

A. The net adjustment to cash represents the difference between sources of funds and uses of funds related to the Acquisition. 

B. The adjustments to other current assets and other assets, net include the recording of estimated deferred debt issuance costs and the elimination of existing deferred financing costs of $3.8 million for Dollar Tree and $4.8 million for Family Dollar. Debt issuance costs will be amortized over the life of the debt; therefore, $29.0 million is classified as other current assets and $170.7 million is classified as other assets, net. 

C. The adjustments to other current assets, other assets, net, other current liabilities and other liabilities include $19.7 million related to deferred compensation balances being reclassified from long-term to current as they are currently payable following the Acquisition. 

D. The adjustment to goodwill consists of $5,362.3 million while the adjustment to intangible asset consists of $2,422.0 million. An adjustment of $926.4 million to deferred tax liabilities is also associated with the intangible asset adjustment. See Note 2 for the estimated purchase price allocation. The pro forma purchase price allocation is preliminary as the Acquisition has not yet been completed. The pro forma presentation assumes that the historical values of Family Dollar’s net assets approximate fair value. Additionally, the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired intangible asset is preliminary and subject to the final outcome of management’s analysis to be conducted, with the assistance of valuation advisors, upon the completion of the Acquisition. The residual amount of the purchase price has been allocated to goodwill. The actual amounts recorded when the Acquisition is completed may differ materially from the pro forma amounts presented herein. 

E. The adjustments to the deferred tax asset consists of $0.1 million for an interest rate lock on Family Dollar debt and a reclassification of $52.9 million of the historical Dollar Tree deferred tax asset to deferred tax liabilities, net as the combined entity has a net liability for long-term deferred taxes. 

F. The adjustments to debt record Dollar Tree’s anticipated borrowings and the related interest, to finance the estimated $6,825.4 million in cash due to Family Dollar shareholders, and other financing costs associated with the Acquisition partly offset by an adjustment to record the repayment of $201.4 million of Family Dollar long-term debt, $750.0 million of Dollar Tree long-term debt and the elimination of related interest and deferred financing cost amortization of $38.0 million for the three quarters ended November 1, 2014, $32.0 million for the four quarters ended February 1, 2014 and $52.2 million for the rolling 12 months ended November 1, 2014. As $77.0 million of the debt that will be outstanding following the Acquisition is payable within 12 months, that amount is included in the current portion of long-term debt. 

Dollar Tree anticipates that it will raise debt to finance the Acquisition as follows: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i) Reflects the allocation of debt as currently anticipated. The actual allocation of the type and amount and the terms of the financing may differ from those set forth above. 

(ii) The estimated interest rate is based on three month LIBOR rates as of January 19, 2015, and the amount of bank and bond debt raised to finance the transaction. The actual interest rates will vary and may fluctuate over the period. An increase (decrease) of 0.25% on the estimated interest rate on debt to finance the Acquisition would result in an increase (decrease) of $21.1 million in annual interest expense. 

(iii) Includes the amortization of the related debt issuance costs for all debt issuances and the commitment fee for the revolving credit facility. 

G. The adjustments to other current liabilities of $18.7 million and $227.1 million in deferred gain to eliminate Family Dollar’s deferred gain on its sale-leaseback transactions. A reduction in the current deferred tax asset of $7.2 million and a long-term deferred tax liability of $86.9 million is also recorded as a result of this adjustment. 

H. The adjustment to other liabilities eliminates Family Dollar’s deferred rent liabilities of $73.0 million and records a deferred tax liability of $27.9 million as a result of the adjustment. 

I. The adjustment includes the elimination of the historical shareholders’ equity of Family Dollar, the elimination of Dollar Tree’s deferred financing costs of $3.8 million and estimated Acquisition transaction fees of $174.0 million. The adjustment also records the estimated stock consideration of $1,888.6 million in Dollar Tree common stock to be issued in connection with the Acquisition. 

J. As a result of the elimination of Family Dollar’s deferred rent liabilities and sale leaseback deferred gains, the amortization of these liabilities as a reduction of rent expense has been eliminated resulting in an increase in Family Dollar’s occupancy costs, which is shown as an adjustment to cost of goods sold to conform to the Dollar Tree presentation. 

K. Interest expense has been adjusted to reflect the net effect of the issuance of new debt and retirement of Family Dollar and Dollar Tree debt. See note F for details of the debt transactions. 

L. The pro forma condensed combined tax provision has been adjusted for the tax effect of adjustments to income before income taxes at the statutory rates in effect for the nine, twelve and rolling twelve month periods, respectively. The effective tax rate of the combined company could be significantly different depending on post-merger activities. 

M. The combined company does not plan to pay a dividend to shareholders after the Acquisition completion.
