FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND

YEAR-END 2014 OPERATING RESULTS

ROCKVILLE, Md. (February 10, 2015) - Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) today reported operating results for its fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2014.

Financial Results

Federal Realty generated funds from operations available for common shareholders (FFO) of $77.7 million, or $1.13 per diluted share for fourth quarter 2014, which was negatively impacted by a charge for early extinguishment of debt. Without the charges for early extinguishment of debt in 2014 and 2013, FFO would have been $88.2 million or $1.28 per diluted share; this compares to $78.2 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2013. For the year ending December 31, 2014, Federal Realty reported FFO of $327.6 million, or $4.79 per diluted share, which includes the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding the early extinguishment of debt charges in both years, FFO would have been $338.1 million, or $4.94 per diluted share in 2014, compared to $303.2 million, or $4.61 per diluted share in 2013. 

Net income available for common shareholders was $35.0 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.51 for fourth quarter 2014 versus $28.3 million and $0.42, respectively, for fourth quarter 2013. For the year ending December 31, 2014, Federal Realty reported net income available for common shareholders of $164.0 million and earnings per diluted share of $2.41. This compares to net income available for shareholders of $162.1 million and earnings per diluted share of $2.46 for the year ending December 31, 2013. 

FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the Trust considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release in addition to Form 8-K that was filed.

Portfolio Results

Same-center property operating income in 2014 increased 4.1% including redevelopments and expansions, and 3.3% excluding redevelopments and expansions compared to 2013. On a quarterly-basis, same-center property operating income in fourth quarter 2014 increased 4.5% including redevelopment and expansion properties, and 3.0% excluding redevelopment and expansion properties, compared to fourth quarter 2013. 

The overall portfolio was 95.6% leased as of December 31, 2014, compared to 95.6% on September 30, 2014 and 95.8% on December 31, 2013. Federal Realty’s same-center portfolio was 95.8% leased on December 31, 2014, compared to 95.9% on September 30, 2014 and 95.8% on December 31, 2013.

During fourth quarter 2014, the Trust signed 83 leases for 343,896 square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), the Trust leased 306,860 square feet at an average cash-basis contractual rent increase per square foot (i.e., excluding the impact of straight-line rents) of 20%. The average contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new lease is $33.27 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $27.76 per square foot for the last year of the prior lease. The previous average contractual rent is calculated by including both the minimum rent and any percentage rent actually paid during the last year of the lease term for the re-leased space. On a GAAP basis (i.e., including the impact of straight-line rents), rent increases per square foot for comparable retail space averaged 32% for fourth quarter 2014.

For all of 2014, Federal Realty signed 340 leases representing 1.5 million square feet of comparable retail space at an average cash-basis contractual rent increase per square foot of 16%, and 29% on a GAAP-basis. The average cash-basis contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new lease is $34.12 per square foot compared to the average cash-basis contractual rent of $29.34 per square foot for the last year of the prior lease. As of December 31, 2014, Federal Realty’s average contractual minimum rent for retail and commercial space in its portfolio is $25.59 per square foot, as compared to $24.54 per square foot on December 31, 2013.

“Our bottom line results for the year represent yet another record for the Trust,” commented Donald C. Wood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Federal Realty Investment Trust. “Importantly, we achieved these results while continuing to execute our long term business plan through successfully delivering the initial phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, executing and expanding our redevelopment pipeline, acquiring strategic assets such as San Antonio Center, and capitalizing our balance sheet for the long term. We are pleased with the value creation we are delivering today and how our balanced business plan enhances our prospects for continued growth and value creation.”

Notes:

(1)There is no guarantee that the Trust will ultimately complete any or all of these opportunities, that the Projected Return on Investment (ROI) or Projected Costs will be the amounts shown or that stabilization will occur as anticipated. The projected ROI and Projected Cost are management's best estimate based on current information and may change over time. 

(2)Projected ROI for redevelopment projects generally reflects only the deal specific cash, unleveraged incremental Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the redevelopment and is calculated as Incremental POI divided by incremental cost. Incremental POI is the POI generated by the redevelopment after deducting rent being paid or management's estimate of rent to be paid for the redevelopment space and any other space taken out of service to accommodate the redevelopment. Projected ROI for redevelopment projects does NOT include peripheral impacts, such as the impact on future lease rollovers at the property or the impact on the long-term value of the property.  

(3)Stabilization is the year in which 95% occupancy of the redeveloped space is achieved. 

(4)All subtotals and totals reflect cost weighted-average ROIs.

Notes:

(1)Anticipated opening dates, total cost, projected return on investment (ROI), anticipated stabilization, and significant tenants for centers under development are subject to adjustment as a result of factors inherent in the development process, some of which may not be under the direct control of the Company. Refer to the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for other risk factors.

(2)Projected ROI for development projects reflects the deal specific cash, unleveraged Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the development and is calculated as POI divided by cost.

(3)Projected costs include an allocation of infrastructure costs for the entire project.

(4)Condos shown at cost; the projected ROI for Phase II does not assume any incremental profit on the sale of condominium units; condominiums are assumed to be sold at cost.

(5)Costs to date include amounts to be reimbursed by third parties.

Glossary of Terms

Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that means net income or loss plus depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, income taxes, gain or loss on sale of real estate, and impairments of real estate, if any. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it approximates a key performance measure in our debt covenants, but it should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Funds From Operations (FFO): FFO is a supplemental measure of real estate companies' operating performances. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with GAAP plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on sale of real estate. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity REIT in order to recognize that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. However, FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to pay dividends. We consider FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 

In addition to FFO, we have also included FFO excluding the "early extinguishment of debt" charges which relate to the early redemption of our 5.65% senior notes and East Bay Bridge mortgage loan in 2014, and our 5.40% senior notes, 5.95% senior notes, and 7.50% mortgage loans in 2013. We believe the unusual nature of these charges, being make-whole payments on the remaining principal and interest on the redeemed notes/mortgages, is worthy of separate evaluation and consequently have provided both relevant metrics.

Property Operating Income: Rental income, other property income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes and excluding operating results from discontinued operations.

Overall Portfolio: Includes all operating properties owned in reporting period.

Same Center: Information provided on a same center basis is provided for only those properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared, excludes properties that were redeveloped, expanded or under development and properties purchased or sold at any time during the periods being compared. 

Tenant Improvements and Incentives: Represents not only the total dollars committed for the improvement (fit-out) of a space as it relates to a specific lease and, except for redevelopments, may also include base building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.
