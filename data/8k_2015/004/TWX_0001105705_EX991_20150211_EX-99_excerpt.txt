NEW YORK, February 11, 2015 – Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2014.  

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes said: “We had another very successful year in 2014, with solid revenue growth and robust 18% Adjusted EPS growth – our sixth consecutive year of at least high teens Adjusted EPS growth. Our financial performance reflects the strength of our position as the world’s leading video content company. For the year, three of Turner’s networks – TBS, TNT and Adult Swim – ranked among ad-supported cable’s top 10 networks in primetime among adults 18-49. TNT was home to 6 of the top 15 original series on ad-supported cable in 2014, more than any other network, including the three most watched new series, The Last Ship, The Librarians, and Murder in the First. CNN strengthened its programming and in 2014 had an average total day monthly reach of almost 77 million total viewers, the highest of any cable news network. HBO also had another outstanding year, airing its most-watched original series ever – Game of Thrones – and its most-watched freshman series, True Detective. HBO’s strong performance was reflected in its 19 Primetime Emmy Awards – the most of any network for the thirteenth consecutive year – and in its highest growth in domestic subscribers in over three decades. Together Warner Bros. and HBO received 13 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture for American Sniper, which set box office records last month. In television production, Warner Bros. is airing more than 60 series for the 2014-2015 television season, including the most primetime series on broadcast networks of any studio for the 11th time in the past 12 seasons. Warner Bros. also successfully mined its rich DC library with Gotham and The Flash emerging as two of the season’s bona fide freshman hits.”  

Mr. Bewkes added: “Last year we also returned $6.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We’re committed to building on our strong record of providing direct returns to shareholders, evidenced by the 10% increase in our dividend approved by our Board, which is the sixth straight year we’ve raised the dividend by double-digits.” 

Full-Year Company Results1  

Full-year revenues increased 3% from 2013 to $27.4 billion due to growth across all divisions. Adjusted Operating Income declined 6% from 2013 to $5.8 billion primarily due to charges at Turner related to its decision to no longer air certain programming and restructuring and severance charges across all segments. Operating Income decreased 5% from 2013 to $6.0 billion.  

The Company posted 2014 Adjusted Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations (“Adjusted EPS”) of $4.15, up 18% from $3.51 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS included a net tax benefit of $639 million primarily related to the reversal of certain tax reserves as a result of an audit settlement. Excluding the tax matters, programming charges at Turner and restructuring and severance charges in the third and fourth quarters, Adjusted EPS would have been $4.05. Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations was $4.41 in 2014 compared to $3.56 in 2013.  

In 2014, Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations reached $3.7 billion and Free Cash Flow totaled $3.5 billion. As of December 31, 2014, Net Debt was $19.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion at the end of 2013, due to share repurchases, dividends and investments and acquisitions, partially offset by the generation of Free Cash Flow, cash received from Time Inc. in connection with the spin-off and proceeds from the sale of the Company’s space in Time Warner Center.  

Fourth-Quarter Company Results  

Revenues declined 1% to $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to declines at Warner Bros., partially offset by increases at Home Box Office and Turner. Adjusted Operating Income decreased 10% to $1.6 billion primarily due to restructuring and severance charges across all segments and charges at Turner related to its decision to no longer air certain programming. Operating Income decreased 20% to $1.4 billion. This included a $173 million foreign currency charge related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from a change in the foreign currency exchange rate used by the Company from the official rate to the SICAD 2 exchange rate.  

In the fourth quarter, the Company posted Adjusted EPS of $0.98 versus $1.07 for the year-ago quarter. Excluding the programming charges at Turner and restructuring and severance charges, Adjusted EPS would have been $1.14. Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations was $0.84 for the three months ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.01 for last year’s fourth quarter.

Stock Repurchase Program Update  

From January 1, 2014 through February 6, 2015, the Company repurchased approximately 80 million shares of common stock for approximately $5.8 billion. These amounts reflect the purchase of approximately 12 million shares of common stock for approximately $948 million since the amounts reported in the Company’s third quarter earnings release issued on November 5, 2014. At February 6, 2015, approximately $4.2 billion remained available for repurchases under the Company’s stock repurchase program.  

1 On June 6, 2014, the Company completed the legal and structural separation of Time Inc. from the Company.

TURNER  

Full-Year Results  

Revenues increased 4% ($413 million) to $10.4 billion, benefiting from growth of 7% ($367 million) in Subscription revenues, 1% ($34 million) in Advertising revenues and 2% ($12 million) in Content and other revenues. The increase in Subscription revenues was primarily due to higher domestic rates and international growth, partially offset by lower domestic subscribers and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Advertising revenues primarily benefited from growth at Turner’s domestic networks, principally due to its news businesses, partially offset by lower audience delivery and demand at its domestic entertainment networks, and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Content and other revenues increased primarily due to higher subscription video-on-demand revenues.  

Adjusted Operating Income decreased 12% ($430 million) to $3.1 billion as higher revenues were more than offset by higher expenses, including increased programming costs and higher restructuring and severance expenses. Programming costs grew 19% primarily due to higher charges ($453 million) related to Turner’s decision to no longer air certain programming. Excluding these charges from both years, programming costs increased 7% primarily due to higher sports programming costs. The current year included $249 million of restructuring and severance costs compared to $93 million in the prior year. Excluding the programming and restructuring and severance charges, Adjusted Operating Income would have been $3.9 billion in 2014.  

Operating Income declined 15% ($532 million) to $3.0 billion. Operating Income included a $137 million foreign currency charge related to the remeasurement of Turner’s net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency.  

In 2014, TBS, TNT and Adult Swim ranked among ad-supported cable’s top 10 networks in primetime among adults 18-49. TBS was the #2 ad-supported cable network in primetime among adults 18-49 and 25-54 in 2014. TNT claimed 6 of the top 15 ad-supported cable original series of 2014, more than any other network. Adult Swim ranked as the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18-24 and 18-34 for the tenth consecutive year, the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18-49 and the #1 ad-supported cable network in primetime among adults 18-24. In 2014, CNN had an average total day monthly reach of almost 77 million total viewers, the largest cumulative audience of any cable news network. In 2014, Turner’s bleacherreport.com averaged 39 million monthly unique visitors, and was the #2 digital sports destination.  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Revenues increased 2% ($59 million) to $2.6 billion, due to increases of 5% ($66 million) in Subscription revenues and 3% ($5 million) in Content and other revenues, offset in part by a decline of 1% ($12 million) in Advertising revenues. The increase in Subscription revenues mainly resulted from higher domestic rates and international growth, partially offset by lower domestic subscribers, the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of a contract dispute with a distributor. Advertising revenues decreased due to declines at Turner’s domestic entertainment networks, primarily due to lower audience delivery and fewer Major League Baseball playoff games. That decline was partially offset by growth at Turner’s domestic news businesses and international networks, despite the negative effect of foreign currency exchange rates.  

Adjusted Operating Income rose 5% ($42 million) to $921 million, primarily reflecting higher revenues. Programming costs declined 1% as Turner incurred $44 million in charges in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $68 million in last year’s quarter. Excluding the programming charges and $26 million in restructuring and severance charges, Adjusted Operating Income would have been $991 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

5  

Operating Income decreased 8% ($65 million) to $788 million and included the $137 million foreign currency charge.  

HOME BOX OFFICE  

Full-Year Results  

Revenues increased 10% ($508 million) to $5.4 billion, due to Subscription revenue growth of 8% ($347 million) and an increase of 24% ($161 million) in Content and other revenues. The increase in Subscription revenues resulted mainly from higher domestic rates and subscribers, as well as the consolidations of HBO Asia and HBO South Asia (collectively, “HBO Asia”) and HBO Nordic. Content and other revenues rose primarily due to the licensing of select original programming to a subscription video-on-demand service and higher home video revenues, which benefited from sales of Game of Thrones: The Complete Third Season.  

Adjusted Operating Income grew 7% ($112 million) to $1.8 billion, reflecting higher revenues, partly offset by increased expenses primarily due to higher programming and distribution costs as well as the comparison against the prior year results, which benefited from a $31 million adjustment to a receivable allowance. The increase in expenses also reflects higher restructuring and severance costs. Programming costs grew 12% mainly due to increased original programming expenses as well as the consolidations of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic. Distribution costs increased primarily due to higher participation expenses. The current year included $63 million of restructuring and severance costs compared to $39 million in the prior year. Excluding the restructuring and severance charges, Adjusted Operating Income would have been $1.9 billion in 2014.  

Operating Income was essentially flat at $1.8 billion. The prior year included $113 million in gains related to HBO’s acquisitions of its partners’ interests in HBO Asia and HBO Nordic.  

In 2014, HBO and Cinemax added a total of 2.8 million domestic subscribers, the most in over 30 years. In 2014, HBO received 19 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most of any network for the thirteenth consecutive year, with True Detective receiving five awards. In 2014, Game of Thrones, HBO’s most watched original series ever, and True Detective, the most-watched freshman season of HBO’s original series, on average reached over 19 million viewers and nearly 12 million viewers, respectively, in the U.S. For the 87th Academy Awards, HBO received two nominations, including Documentary Feature for Citizenfour.  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Revenues increased 6% ($78 million) to $1.3 billion, due to Subscription revenue growth of 5% ($55 million) and an increase of 14% ($23 million) in Content and other revenues. The increase in Subscription revenues resulted mainly from higher domestic rates and subscribers. Content and other revenues grew due to higher home video revenues.  

Adjusted Operating Income decreased 5% ($20 million) to $394 million, primarily due to higher programming, distribution and marketing costs. Programming costs grew 15% due to higher expenses for originals and acquired theatrical product. Similar to the full year results, the increase in distribution costs was primarily due to higher participation expenses.  

Operating Income declined 5% ($19 million) to $394 million.  

6  

WARNER BROS.  

Full-Year Results  

Revenues increased 2% ($214 million) to $12.5 billion, due to stronger television revenues, primarily due to growth in initial telecast fees, including from the acquisition of Eyeworks Group’s operations outside the U.S., and higher international television licensing revenues due to growth in both subscription video-on-demand and linear television revenues. Revenues also benefited from a patent license and settlement agreement. The increase was partially offset by declines in theatrical and physical home video revenues due to the comparison to the strong 2013 theatrical and home entertainment slate as well as the negative effect of foreign currency exchange rates.  

Adjusted Operating Income decreased 6% ($79 million) to $1.2 billion, as higher revenues were more than offset by higher television production costs and increased restructuring and severance costs. The current year included $169 million of restructuring and severance costs compared to $49 million in the prior year. Excluding the restructuring and severance charges, Adjusted Operating Income would have been $1.4 billion in 2014.  

Operating Income decreased 12% ($165 million) to $1.2 billion. Operating Income included a $36 million foreign currency charge related to the remeasurement of Warner Bros.’ net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency. The current year also included $41 million in asset impairments.  

Warner Bros. has over 60 series airing on television for the 2014-2015 television season, including 34 primetime series on broadcast networks, the most of any studio for the 11th time in the past 12 years. Season-to-date, The Big Bang Theory ranked as broadcast television’s #1 series among adults 18-49 and The Voice ranked as broadcast television’s #1 non-scripted series among adults 18-49. For the 87th Academy Awards, Warner Bros. received 11 nominations, including a Best Picture nomination for American Sniper. Through February 8, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies grossed nearly $940 million at the worldwide box office. In 2014, Warner Bros. remained #1 domestically in overall home entertainment.  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Revenues decreased 5% ($181 million) to $3.8 billion, mainly due to lower home entertainment and videogames revenues. The current year period included the home entertainment releases of Edge of Tomorrow and Tammy. The prior year period included the home entertainment releases of Man of Steel, Pacific Rim and The Hangover Part III and the videogame release of Batman: Arkham Origins. Also contributing to the decline was the negative effect of foreign currency exchange rates. The decline was partially offset by higher television licensing revenues. 

Adjusted Operating Income decreased 32% ($185 million) to $391 million, mainly due to the decline in revenues and higher restructuring and severance charges. The current year quarter included $119 million of restructuring and severance costs compared to $16 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the restructuring and severance charges, Adjusted Operating Income would have been $510 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

Operating Income decreased 44% ($254 million) to $319 million and included the $36 million foreign currency charge and $36 million of asset impairments.  

CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME AND PER SHARE RESULTS  

Full-Year Results  

Adjusted EPS was $4.15 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $3.51 in 2013. The increase in Adjusted EPS primarily reflects lower taxes as a result of a net tax benefit of $639 million primarily related to the reversal of certain tax reserves in 2014 and fewer shares outstanding, offset in part by lower Adjusted Operating Income.  

7  

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company had Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders of $3.9 billion, or $4.41 per diluted common share. This compares to Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders in 2013 of $3.4 billion, or $3.56 per diluted common share.  

For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company reported Net Income of $3.8 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Adjusted EPS was $0.98 for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1.07 in last year’s fourth quarter. The decrease in Adjusted EPS primarily reflects lower Adjusted Operating Income and higher taxes, offset in part by fewer shares outstanding.  

For the three months ended December 31, 2014, the Company had Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders of $720 million, or $0.84 per diluted common share. This compares to Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2014 of $934 million, or $1.01 per diluted common share.  

For the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, the Company had Net Income of $718 million and $983 million, respectively.  

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The Company utilizes Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Operating Income margin and Adjusted EPS, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses. These measures are considered important indicators of the operational strength of the Company’s businesses. Some limitations of Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Operating Income margin and Adjusted EPS are that they do not reflect certain charges that affect the operating results of the Company’s businesses and they involve judgment as to whether items affect fundamental operating performance.  

Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is Operating Income (Loss) excluding the impact of noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks); gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; external costs related to mergers, acquisitions or dispositions, as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations; and the foreign currency loss during the three months ended December 31, 2014, related to the translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from the Company’s change to begin using the SICAD 2 exchange rate. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income divided by Revenues.  

Adjusted EPS is Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders with the following items excluded from Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders: noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets and investments; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks), liabilities and investments; gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions, as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations; the foreign currency loss during the three months ended December 31, 2014 related to the translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from the Company’s change to begin using the SICAD 2 exchange rate; and amounts attributable to businesses classified as discontinued operations; as  

8  

 well as the impact of taxes and noncontrolling interests on the above items and the Company’s share of the above items with respect to equity method investments. Adjusted EPS is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company’s businesses as this measure eliminates amounts that do not reflect the fundamental performance of the Company’s businesses. The Company utilizes Adjusted EPS, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses both on an absolute basis and relative to its peers and the broader market. Many investors also use an adjusted EPS measure as a common basis for comparing the performance of different companies.  

Free Cash Flow is defined as Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations plus payments related to securities litigation and government investigations (net of any insurance recoveries), external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions, to the extent such costs are expensed, contingent consideration payments made in connection with acquisitions, and excess tax benefits from equity instruments, less capital expenditures, principal payments on capital leases and partnership distributions, if any. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate its businesses and this measure is considered an important indicator of the Company’s liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, pay dividends to common shareholders and repurchase stock.  

A general limitation of these measures is that they are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation and excluded items. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company’s Operating Income (Loss), Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations and various cash flow measures (e.g., Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations), as well as other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Venezuelan Foreign Currency Loss  

Certain of the Company’s divisions conduct business with third parties located in Venezuela and, as a result, the Company holds net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan Bolivares Fuertes (“VEF”) that primarily consist of cash and accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2014, there were three legal foreign currency exchange systems administered by the Venezuelan government, each with a different exchange rate: (i) the fixed official government rate as published by the Central Bank of Venezuela, which as of December 31, 2014 was 6.3 VEF to each U.S. Dollar, (ii) the variable, auction-based SICAD 1 rate, which as of December 31, 2014 was 12 VEF to each U.S. Dollar and (iii) the variable, transaction-based SICAD 2 rate, which as of December 31, 2014 was approximately 50 VEF to each U.S. Dollar. Because of Venezuelan government-imposed restrictions on the exchange of VEF into foreign currency in Venezuela, the Company has not been able to convert VEF earned in Venezuela into U.S. Dollars through the official government rate. Further, the Company has not been able to access the SICAD 1 and SICAD 2 exchanges due to government requirements and restrictions on participation in the exchanges, including a requirement that an entity be domiciled in Venezuela to participate.  

Prior to December 31, 2014, the Company used the official government exchange rate to remeasure its VEF-denominated transactions and balances. This was principally due to the Company’s inability to access the SICAD 1 and SICAD 2 exchange systems, as noted above, as well as a lack of clarity about those exchange systems’ stability and transaction volume. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company considered information about the companies that were able to access the three exchange systems during 2014 and the fact that the SICAD 1 and SICAD 2 exchanges continued to operate, as well as the state of the Venezuelan economy, which has been negatively impacted by significantly lower oil prices and which the Venezuela Central Bank confirmed in late December 2014 had entered a recession. Based on these factors, as of December 31, 2014, the Company concluded that the SICAD 2 exchange rate was the most appropriate legal exchange rate for the Company’s business activities conducted in VEF. Accordingly, beginning on December 31, 2014, the Company began using the SICAD 2 rate to remeasure its VEF-denominated transactions and balances and, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014, recognized a pretax foreign exchange loss of $137 million at the Turner segment and $36 million at the Warner Bros. segment. The Venezuelan foreign currency loss is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.
