“Our 2014 net income increased 10 percent from a year ago, reflecting lower litigation-related expenses, a decrease in pension expense, and our continued drive for efficiency,” said Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. “Also, credit quality continued to be strong. We had modestly lower net interest income due to the decline in accretion as well as the impact of the continued low-rate environment and loan portfolio dynamics, all of which were predominantly offset by the contribution from loan growth. Our loan and deposit growth was solid in 2014, as average total loans increased $2.2 billion, or 5 percent, and average deposits were up $3.1 billion, or 6 percent, with increases in all business lines and all three of our major markets.

“As expected, fourth quarter average loans increased $202 million compared to the third quarter, the result of seasonality in National Dealer Services and Mortgage Banker Finance, as well as small increases in most other businesses. Average deposit growth was robust, increasing $2.6 billion compared to the third quarter. Revenue increased 2 percent with higher fee income generation. Our expenses reflected certain efficiency-related actions as well as seasonally higher technology and consulting expenses. Credit quality was strong. While we have not yet seen adverse trends materialize in our Energy portfolio, our methodology has appropriately considered the impact of the recent fall in oil and gas prices in our year-end allowance.

“While we continue to manage headwinds, including the low-rate environment as well as rising technology and regulatory expenses, we remain focused on the long term. We believe our diverse geographic footprint is well situated, and along with our relationship banking strategy should contribute to our long-term growth. We continue to be well positioned for rising rates and to benefit as the economy continues to improve.”

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income increased $10 million to $225 million for the fourth quarter 2014, compared to $215 million for the third quarter 2014. Customer-driven fee income increased $11 million and noncustomer-driven income was stable. The increase in customer-driven fee income primarily reflected increases in customer derivative income of $6 million (a component of other noninterest income) and commercial lending fees of $3 million.

Noninterest Expenses

Noninterest expenses increased $22 million to $419 million in the fourth quarter 2014 compared to $397 million in the third quarter 2014. The increase primarily reflected the impact of expenses of $4 million in the fourth quarter related to certain efficiency-related actions compared to a net benefit of $8 million from actions taken in the third quarter 2014, as well as a $5 million increase in technology-related contract labor expense and seasonal increases in consulting and advertising expenses. Actions taken in the fourth quarter were primarily associated with real estate optimization. Third quarter actions included the early redemption of debt, resulting in a $32 million gain, a $9 million contribution to the Comerica Charitable Foundation, and other charges totaling $15 million associated with real estate optimization and several other efficiency-related actions, which included $6 million in salaries and benefits expense (severance-related) and $5 million in occupancy expense.

Credit Quality

“Credit quality continued to be strong, with only 1 basis point of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter and 5 basis points for the full-year 2014. Nonaccrual loans are at the lowest level since 2007,” said Babb. “This includes our Energy business, where our 30-plus years of expertise has been demonstrated by strong performance through a number of cycles. We have a robust Energy credit policy, and as of year-end 2014 less than 3 percent of the portfolio is classified as criticized, with no nonaccruals. Given that the significant decline in oil and gas prices has only materialized in the past couple of months and our customers are generally well hedged, we have not yet seen adverse trends in the portfolio. We continue to closely monitor the total portfolio, as well as the Energy sector, and any residual impacts on the Texas economy. Our methodology has appropriately considered these developments in our year-end allowance."

Balance Sheet and Capital Management

Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $69.2 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2014, compared to $68.9 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2014.

There were approximately 179 million common shares outstanding at December 31, 2014. Combined with the dividend of $0.20 per share, share repurchases under the share repurchase program and dividends returned 63 percent of fourth quarter 2014 net income to shareholders.

Comerica's tangible common equity ratio was 9.85 percent at December 31, 2014, a decrease of 9 basis points from September 30, 2014. The estimated Tier 1 common capital ratio decreased 6 basis points, to 10.53 percent at December 31, 2014, from September 30, 2014. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio under fully phased-in Basel III capital rules and excluding most elements of AOCI was 10.3 percent percent at December 31, 2014. 

Full-Year 2015 Outlook

Management expectations for full-year 2015 compared to full-year 2014, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low-rate environment, are as follows:

•Average full-year loan growth consistent with 2014, reflecting typical seasonality throughout the year and continued focus on pricing and structure discipline.

•Net interest income relatively stable, assuming no rise in interest rates, reflecting a decrease of about $30 million in purchase accounting accretion, to $4 million to $6 million, and the impact of a continuing low rate environment on asset yields, offset by earning asset growth. 

•Provision for credit losses higher, consistent with modest net charge-offs and continued loan growth.

•Noninterest income relatively stable, reflecting growth in fee income, particularly card fees and fiduciary income, mostly offset by regulatory impacts on letter of credit, derivative and warrant income.

•Noninterest expenses higher, reflecting increases in technology, regulatory and pension expenses, as well as typical inflationary pressures, with continued focus on driving efficiencies for the long term.

•Income tax expense to approximate 33 percent of pre-tax income.

•Net interest income increased $10 million, primarily due to an increase in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) credits, largely due to the increase in average deposits, and an increase in purchase accounting accretion, partially offset by the impact of lower loan yields, in part due to a negative leasing residual value adjustment.

•The provision for credit losses increased $14 million, primarily due to increases in Energy and Corporate Banking, partially offset by decreases in Technology and Life Sciences and general Middle Market. 

•Noninterest income increased $7 million, primarily due to increases in customer derivative income and commercial lending fees.

•Noninterest expenses decreased $4 million, primarily due to a decrease in allocated corporate overhead expenses due to certain actions taken in the third quarter 2014, including a contribution to the Comerica Charitable Foundation, charges associated with real estate optimization and several other efficiency-related expenses.

(b) December 31, 2014 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.

(c) Estimated ratios based on the standardized approach in the final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework, as fully phased-in, and excluding most elements of AOCI.

The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio further adjusts Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets to account for the final rule approved by U.S. banking regulators in July 2013 for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The final Basel III capital rules are effective January 1, 2015 for banking organizations subject to the standardized approach. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders equity per share of common stock. Comerica believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.
