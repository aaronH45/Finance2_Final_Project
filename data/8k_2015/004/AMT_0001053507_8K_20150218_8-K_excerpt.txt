 Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

(e) On February 18, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of American Tower Corporation (the “Company”) considered the compensation arrangements with the Company’s executive officers. The information in the table below sets forth the determinations of the Compensation Committee with respect to base salaries and cash bonus incentive targets for the year ending December 31, 2015 for the Company’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer and the three other most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers on December 31, 2014 (collectively, the “Current Named Executive Officers”).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In determining annual cash bonus incentive payments for the Company’s Current Named Executive Officers at the end of the year, the Compensation Committee bases its decisions on a number of factors, including the Company’s financial performance, the achievement of certain strategic goals established at the beginning of the fiscal year, and each executive’s contribution to the Company’s overall performance. If the Company exceeds its goals and/or the executive exceeds his established goals, the annual cash bonus incentive could be subject to increase by the Compensation Committee, up to a maximum of 200% of the executive’s bonus target.  

As part of the Company’s long-term incentive compensation plan for 2015, in addition to stock options and restricted stock units, the Compensation Committee granted each Current Named Executive Officer performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) with a three-year performance-based vesting period, pursuant to the Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan. A copy of the form of award agreement for the PSUs is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and the foregoing description of the form of award agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and provisions thereof.  

Additional information regarding compensation of the Current Named Executive Officers will be included in the Company’s 2015 Proxy Statement when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
