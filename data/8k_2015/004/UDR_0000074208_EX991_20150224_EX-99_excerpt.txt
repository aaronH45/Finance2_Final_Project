Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO"): The Company defines AFFO as FFO as Adjusted less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company's operational performance than FFO or FFO as Adjusted. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. The Company believes that net income attributable to UDR, Inc. is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not always be comparable to AFFO calculated by other REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. A reconciliation from net income attributable to UDR, Inc. to AFFO is provided on page 30 of this presentation. Development Communities: The Company defines Development Communities as those communities recently developed or under development by the Company, that are currently majority owned by the Company and have not achieved stabilization as of the most recent quarter. Discontinued Operations: Effective January 1, 2014, UDR prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, for all communities not previously sold or classified as held for sale. ASU 2014-08 incorporates into the definition of a discontinued operation a requirement that a disposition represent a strategic shift in an entity’s operations, which resulted in UDR no longer classifying the sale of communities as a discontinued operation. Communities that meet the criteria to be classified as held for disposition subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2014-08 are presented as held for disposition in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the current period, but do not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations in accordance with ASU 2014-08. Prior to the prospective adoption of ASU 2014-08, FASB ASC Subtopic 205.20, required, among other things, that the primary assets and liabilities and the results of operations of UDR’s real properties that have been sold or are held for disposition, be classified as discontinued operations and segregated in UDR’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Consequently, the primary assets and liabilities and the net operating results of those properties sold or classified as held for disposition prior to January 1, 2014 are accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented. This presentation does not have an impact on net income available to common stockholders, it only results in the reclassification of the operating results within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the reclassification of the assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, UDR sold 2 communities with a total of 914 homes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, UDR sold one commercial property that was classified as real estate held for disposition prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08 and is therefore presented as a discontinued operation. The results of operations for these properties are classified on the Consolidated Statements of Operations on Attachment 1 of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure in the line item entitled “Income from discontinued operations, net of tax”. Effective New Lease Rate Growth: The Company defines effective new lease rate growth as the increase in gross potential rent realized less all concessions for the new lease term (current effective rent) versus prior resident effective rent for the prior lease term on all new leases commenced during the current quarter. Management considers effective new lease rate growth a useful metric for investors as it assesses market-level new demand trends. Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth: The Company defines effective renewal lease rate growth as the increase in gross potential rent realized less all concessions for the new lease term (current effective rent) versus prior effective rent for the prior lease term on all renewed leases commenced during the current quarter. Management considers effective renewal lease rate growth a useful metric for investors as it assesses market-level, in-place demand trends. Estimated Quarter of Completion: The Company defines estimated quarter of completion of a development or redevelopment project as the date on which construction is expected to be completed, but does not represent the date of stabilization. Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio: The Company defines Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as net income, excluding the impact of interest expense, real estate depreciation and amortization of wholly owned and other joint venture communities, other depreciation and amortization, noncontrolling interests, net gain on the sale of depreciable property, RE3 income tax, divided by total interest plus preferred dividends. Management considers fixed charge coverage a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation of the components that comprise fixed charge coverage is provided on page 29 of this presentation. Funds From Operations as Adjusted: The Company defines FFO as Adjusted as FFO excluding the impact of acquisition-related costs and other non-comparable items including, but not limited to, prepayment costs/benefits associated with early debt retirement, gains on sales of marketable securities and TRS property, deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases, storm-related expenses and recoveries, severance costs and legal costs. Management believes that FFO as Adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other REITs. FFO as Adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. The Company believes that net income attributable to UDR, Inc. is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO as Adjusted. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures and, accordingly, our FFO as Adjusted may not always be comparable to FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures calculated by other REITs. FFO as Adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity. A reconciliation from net income attributable to UDR, Inc. to FFO as Adjusted is provided on page 30 of this presentation. Net Asset Value: Net Asset Value (“NAV”) is defined as marked-to-market value of assets less marked-to-market value of liabilities and preferred equity, divided by total outstanding diluted shares and operating units. Management considers NAV a useful metric for investors as it provides context to portfolio value changes over time based on widely accepted market inputs. Funds From Operations ("FFO"): The Company defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust's definition issued in April 2002. In the computation of diluted FFO, OP units, unvested restricted stock, stock options, and the shares of Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive; therefore, they are included in the diluted share count. 26  

DEFINITIONS AND RECONCILIATIONS Activities of our taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS), RE3, include development and land entitlement. From time to time, we develop and subsequently sell a TRS property which results in a short- term use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional long-term investment in real estate for REITs. We believe that the inclusion of these TRS gains in FFO is consistent with the standards established by NAREIT as the short-term investment is incidental to our main business. TRS gains on sales, net of taxes, are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation. Management considers FFO a useful metric for investors as the Company uses FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of the Company's activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. A reconciliation from net income attributable to UDR, Inc. to FFO is provided on page 30 of this presentation. Held For Disposition Communities: The Company defines Held for Disposition Communities as those communities that were held for sale as of the end of the most recent quarter. Interest Coverage Ratio: The Company defines Interest Coverage Ratio as net income, excluding the impact of interest expense, real estate depreciation and amortization of wholly owned and joint venture communities, other depreciation and amortization, noncontrolling interests, net gain on the sale of depreciable property, RE3 income tax, divided by total interest. Management considers interest coverage ratio a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation of the components that comprise interest coverage ratio is provided on page 29 of this presentation. Joint Venture Reconciliation at UDR's Weighted Average Pro-Rata Ownership Interest JV Return on Equity ("ROE"): The Company defines JV ROE as the pro rata share of property NOI plus property and asset management fee revenue less interest expense, divided by the average of beginning and ending equity capital for the quarter. Management considers ROE a useful metric for investors as it provides a widely used measure of how well the Company is investing its capital on a leveraged basis. JV Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC"): The Company defines JV ROIC as the pro rata share of property NOI plus property and asset management fee revenue divided by the average of beginning and ending invested capital for the quarter. Management considers ROIC a useful metric for investors as it provides a widely used measure of how well the Company is investing its capital on an unleveraged basis. Net Operating Income (“NOI”): The Company defines NOI as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense which is calculated as 2.75% of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations, and land rent. Management considers NOI a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporate-level expense allocations, general and administrative costs, capital structure and depreciation and amortization and is a widely used input, along with capitalization rates, in the determination of real estate valuations. A reconciliation from net income attributable to UDR, Inc. to NOI is provided below. Non-Mature: The Company defines Non-Mature Communities as those communities that have not met the criteria to be included in Same-Store Communities. Non-Residential / Other: The Company defines Non-Residential / Other as non-apartment components of mixed-use properties, land held, properties being prepared for redevelopment and properties where a material change in home count has occurred. Physical Occupancy: The Company defines physical occupancy as the number of occupied homes divided by the total homes available at a community.

DEFINITIONS AND RECONCILIATIONS QTD Same-Store ("SS") Communities: The Company defines QTD SS Communities as those communities stabilized for five full consecutive quarters. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the quarter in the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not held for disposition within the current year. RE3: RE3 is the Company's taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") that focuses on development, land entitlement and short-term hold investments. TRS gains on sales, net of taxes, is defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation. Recurring Capital Expenditures: The Company defines recurring capital expenditures as expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at its communities. Redevelopment Communities: The Company generally defines Redevelopment Communities as those communities where greater than 10% of the available apartment homes are off-line for major renovation and those that did not achieve stabilization as of the most recent quarter. Redevelopment Projected Weighted Average Return on Incremental Capital Invested: The projected weighted average return on incremental capital invested for redevelopment projects is NOI as set forth in the Stabilization Period for Redevelopment Yield definition, less Recurring Capital Expenditures, minus the project’s annualized operating NOI prior to commencing the redevelopment, less Recurring Capital Expenditures, divided by total cost of the project. Return on Equity ("ROE"): The Company defines ROE as a referenced quarter's NOI less interest expense, annualized, divided by the average of beginning and ending equity capital for the quarter. Management considers ROE a useful metric for investors as it provides a widely used measure of how well the Company is investing its capital on a leveraged basis. Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC"): The Company defines ROIC as a referenced quarter's NOI, annualized, divided by the average of beginning and ending invested capital for the quarter. Management considers ROIC a useful metric for investors as it provides a widely used measure of how well the Company is investing its capital on an unleveraged basis. Revenue Enhancing Capital Expenditures: The Company defines revenue-enhancing capital expenditures as expenditures that result in increased income generation over time. Management considers revenue enhancing capital expenditures a useful metric for investors as it quantifies the amount of capital expenditures that are expected to grow, not just maintain, revenues. Sold Communities: The Company defines Sold Communities as those communities that previously met the criteria for discontinued operations and were disposed of prior to the end of the most recent quarter. Stabilization for Same Store Classification: The Company generally defines stabilization as when a community’s occupancy reaches 90% or above for at least three consecutive months. Stabilized, Non-Mature Communities: The Company defines Stabilized, Non-Mature Communities as those communities that are stabilized but not yet in the Company's Same-Store portfolio. Stabilization Period for Development Yield: The Company defines the stabilization period for development property yield as the forward twelve month NOI, excluding any remaining lease-up concessions outstanding, commencing one year following the delivery of the final home of the project. Stabilization Period for Redevelopment Yield: The Company defines the stabilization period for a redevelopment property yield for purposes of computing the Projected Weighted Average Return on Incremental Capital Invested, as the forward twelve month NOI, excluding any remaining lease-up concessions outstanding, commencing one year following the delivery of the final home of a project. Stabilized Yield on Developments: Expected stabilized yields on development are calculated as follows, projected stabilized NOI less management fees divided by budgeted construction cost on a project-specific basis. Projected stabilized NOI for development projects, calculated in accordance with the NOI reconciliation provided on page 16 of this presentation, is set forth in the definition of Stabilization Period for Development Yield. Given the differing completion dates and years for which NOI is being projected for these communities as well as the complexities associated with estimating other expenses upon completion such as corporate overhead allocation, general and administrative costs and capital structure, a reconciliation to GAAP measures is not meaningful. Projected NOI for these projects is neither provided, nor is representative of Management’s expectations for the Company’s overall financial performance or cash flow growth and there can be no assurances that forecast NOI growth implied in the estimated construction yield of any project will be achieved. Management considers estimated stabilized yield on development as a useful metric for investors as it helps provide context to the expected effects that development projects will have on the Company’s future performance once stabilized. Total Revenue per Occupied Home: The Company defines total revenue per occupied home as rental and other revenues, calculated in accordance with GAAP, divided by the product of occupancy and the number of apartment homes. Management considers total revenue per occupied home a useful metric for investors as it serves as a proxy for portfolio quality, both geographic and physical. Value Creation: Value creation is defined as the difference between the Company’s best estimate of the current or expected market value of a community and its original purchase price or cost basis. Underlying valuation estimates and model inputs are provided by the Company. Estimated value creation is not representative of the Company’s expectations for its overall financial performance or cash flow growth and there can be no assurances that the value creation implied for any of the Company’s communities will be achieved. Management considers value creation a useful metric for investors as it quantifies how successful the Company’s past investments have been and current investments are expected to be. YTD Same-Store ("SS") Communities: The Company defines YTD SS Communities as those communities stabilized for two full consecutive calendar years. These communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not held for disposition within the current year. All guidance is based on current expectations of future economic conditions and the judgment of the Company's management team.

 Net Debt to EBITDA: The Company defines net debt to EBITDA as total debt net of cash and cash equivalents divided by EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net income, excluding the impact of interest expense, real estate depreciation and amortization of wholly owned and other joint venture communities, other depreciation and amortization, noncontrolling interests, net gain on the sale of depreciable property, and RE3 income tax. Management considers net debt to EBITDA a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation between net income and EBITDA is provided below: DEFINITIONS AND RECONCILIATIONS Net Debt-to-EBITDA ($000s) Quarter Ended December 31, 2014 Net income/(loss) attributable to UDR, Inc. $ 65,417 Adjustments (includes continuing and discontinued operations): Interest expense 32,792 Real estate depreciation and amortization 91,406 Real estate depreciation and amortization on unconsolidated joint ventures 12,207 Other depreciation and amortization 2,117 Noncontrolling interests 2,335 Income tax expense/(benefit) (7,087) EBITDA $ 199,187 Gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned, net of tax (61,267) Acquisition-related costs/(fees), including joint ventures 264 Casualty-related (recoveries)/charges, net 41 EBITDA - adjusted for non-recurring items $ 138,225 Annualized EBITDA – adjusted for non-recurring items $ 552,900 Interest expense $ 32,792 Capitalized interest expense 4,854 Total interest $ 37,646 Preferred dividends $ 931 Total debt $ 3,583,105 Cash 15,224 Net Debt $ 3,567,881 Interest Coverage Ratio 5.29x Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio 5.16x Interest Coverage Ratio – adjusted for non-recurring items 3.67x Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio – adjusted for non-recurring items 3.58x Net Debt-to-EBITDA, adjusted for non-recurring items 6.5x 29  

(1) During 4Q13, the Company sold its interest in the Lodge at Stoughton community and recognized a gross GAAP gain of $8.3 million, which was recorded as income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities, and related tax expense of $3.0 million, which was recorded as tax benefit/(provision), net. $2.7 million of the net gain on the sale of our interest in the unconsolidated joint venture is included in FFO and excluded from FFO as Adjusted as it was a gain on a development asset, which is incidental to our main business. The $2.7 million FFO gain represents the net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation. (2) During 4Q14, the Company recognized a one-time tax benefit of $5.8 million related to the conversion of certain taxable REIT subsidiary entities into REIT's. (3) 2014 adjustment relates to damages at our Rosebeach community in California as a result of the earthquake in March 2014 and the storm that hit the west coast in December 2014. 2013 adjustment primarily represents the portion of Hurricane Sandy insurance recoveries in 2013 that relate to the $9.3 million in charges added back to FFO as Adjusted in 4Q12. The difference between the casualty-related recoveries reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the adjustment above represents the amount of 2013 business interruption recoveries during 2013. The business interruption insurance recoveries are offset by lost rental revenues from the business interruption in 2013.
