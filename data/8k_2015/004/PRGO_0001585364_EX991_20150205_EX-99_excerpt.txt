DUBLIN, Ireland - February 5, 2015 - Perrigo Company plc (NYSE: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for its second quarter ended December 27, 2014.

Perrigo’s Chairman, President and CEO Joseph C. Papa commented, “The team's financial performance for the quarter was generally in-line with our expectations, highlighted by record second quarter net sales, adjusted net income and adjusted margins. U.S. OTC grew approximately 2%, and we realized new product sales of $54 million, primarily in the Rx segment. Offsetting these positive impacts, we experienced the previously disclosed quarterly decline in CHC contract sales and disappointing sales in the VMS Nutritional and Animal Health categories. Our team remains intensely focused on launching greater than 

1

$235 million in new products in fiscal 2015, the majority in the second half of the year, illustrating our continued commitment to make quality healthcare more affordable for consumers around the globe."

Refer to Tables I, II, and III at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments to the current year and prior year periods and additional non-GAAP information. The Company’s reported results are summarized in the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations, Balance Sheets and Cash Flows.

Second Quarter Results

Net sales in the quarter were $1.07 billion, an increase of 9% over the second quarter of fiscal 2014, primarily attributable to $79 million in incremental sales of Tysabri® from the acquisition of Elan Corporation plc ("Elan") and new product sales of $54 million. This increase was offset partially by lower sales volumes in the contract manufacturing and Animal Health categories within Consumer Healthcare and the VMS and infant foods categories within the Nutritionals segment, as well as a negative foreign exchange impact of $7 million. 

Excluding charges as outlined in Table I at the end of this release, second quarter fiscal 2015 adjusted net income increased 32% to $245 million or $1.82 per diluted share versus $1.87 for the same period last year. The earnings for the quarter exclude $0.06 per share of dilution attributable to the pre-closing debt and equity issuances related to the Omega transaction.

Consumer Healthcare

Consumer Healthcare Segment 

(in millions)

(see the attached Table II for reconciliation to GAAP numbers)

(YoY % Change may not calculate due to rounding)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Consumer Healthcare segment net sales were $530 million, reflecting an increase in sales of existing products of $13 million (primarily in the smoking cessation category) and $13 million related to new product sales and the acquisition of OTC products from Aspen. These combined increases were more than offset by a decline of $30 million in sales of existing products (primarily in the contract manufacturing and Animal Health categories).

Adjusted gross margin grew 40 bps due to greater sales of higher margin products versus last year while, adjusted operating margin was driven by relatively lower promotional expenses versus last year.

3

Nutritionals

Nutritionals Segment 

(in millions)

(see the attached Table II for reconciliation to GAAP numbers)

(YoY % Change may not calculate due to rounding)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Nutritionals segment reported second quarter net sales of $131 million as new product sales of $12 million were more than offset by $12 million in lower year-over-year sales primarily in the VMS and infant food categories and $8 million in discontinued products. Increased competition in the VMS category and retailer promotion in the infant food categories were the primary drivers in the quarter.

Second quarter gross margin contracted due to competition in the market place in the VMS category and an isolated $3 million inventory loss, which the Company expects to recover in a future period through an insurance claim.

4

Rx Pharmaceuticals

Rx Pharmaceuticals Segment 

(in millions)

(see the attached Table II for reconciliation to GAAP numbers)

(YoY % Change may not calculate due to rounding)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Rx Pharmaceuticals segment reported second quarter net sales of $277 million due to new product sales of $33 million and increased volumes, partially offset by discontinued products of $14 million.

Adjusted operating margin was impacted by higher investments in both clinical R&D and in growing the specialty pharmaceuticals sales force. 

5

API

API Segment 

(in millions)

(see the attached Table II for reconciliation to GAAP numbers)

(YoY % Change may not calculate due to rounding)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The API segment’s second quarter net sales were flat versus last year due to a slight increase in sales of existing products offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Gross margin was impacted primarily by the expiration of U.S. exclusivity on the generic version of temozolomide while operating margin flow-through benefited from lower selling, general and administration costs.

6

Specialty Sciences

Specialty Sciences Segment 

(in millions)

(see the attached Table II for reconciliation to GAAP numbers)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the second quarter, the Company recognized $87 million of royalty revenue related to Biogen Idec's global sales of its Multiple Sclerosis drug Tysabri®. The increase is due to the timing of the closing of the Elan acquisition on December 18, 2013 as well as the higher current royalty rate of 18% versus 12% last year.

7

Closing

Excluding the charges outlined in Table III (which includes all impacts related to the Omega acquisition), the Company expects fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings to be between $7.25 and $7.45 per diluted share as compared to $6.39 in fiscal 2014. This range implies a year-over-year growth rate in adjusted earnings per diluted share of 13% to 17% over fiscal 2014. The Company also expects fiscal 2015 reported earnings to be between $3.66 and $3.86 per diluted share as compared to $1.77 in fiscal 2014. A reconciliation to GAAP measures is attached in Table III.

The following factors are not reflected in the guidance range above: 

•Debt and equity financing costs and additional shares issued related to the Omega financings of $0.44 per diluted share.

•Omega operating results for the remaining forecast period, shares to be issued to complete the acquisition, and transaction related costs.
