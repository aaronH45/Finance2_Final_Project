MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS

Record Q4 Adjusted EPS; 27% Increase Over PY

Adjusted Operating Income Up 160 bps

Calhoun, Georgia, February 19, 2015 - Mohawk Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MHK) today announced 2014 fourth quarter net earnings of $147 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.00. Excluding unusual charges, net earnings were $167 million and EPS was $2.27, a 27% increase over last year’s fourth quarter adjusted EPS and the highest Q4 adjusted EPS in the company’s history. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $1.95 billion, an increase of 1.4% versus the prior year’s fourth quarter or approximately 5% on a constant exchange basis. For the fourth quarter of 2013, net sales were $1.92 billion, net earnings were $95 million and EPS was $1.29; excluding unusual charges, net earnings were $131 million and EPS was $1.79.

For the twelve months ending December 31, 2014, net sales were $7.8 billion, an increase of 6% versus the prior year as reported or 7% on a constant exchange basis. Net earnings and EPS for the twelve month period were $532 million and $7.25, respectively. Net earnings excluding unusual charges were $598 million and adjusted EPS was $8.15, an increase of 24% over the twelve month adjusted EPS results in 2013. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2013, net sales were $7.3 billion, net earnings were $349 million and EPS was $4.82; excluding unusual charges, net earnings and EPS were $473 million and $6.55, respectively.

Commenting on Mohawk Industries’ fourth quarter performance, Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum, Chairman and CEO, stated, “During the period, we significantly increased our adjusted operating income by 18% compared to the prior year as a result of productivity initiatives, aggressive cost containment and benefits from our acquisitions. We delivered solid results during the quarter, generating increased earnings even with negative translation impact from foreign currency. On a local basis, our European operations improved across all product categories in a challenging market. Across the enterprise, we reduced SG&A as a percentage of sales and held total dollars flat while still investing in growth areas of the business.”

Carpet segment net sales for the quarter were $780 million, up 4% over last year. Our adjusted operating income increased approximately 32% over the prior year to 11%, producing our best quarterly performance in over a decade. We continue to benefit from product innovation, enhanced raw material strategies, plant simplification, investments in state-of-the-art technologies and improved sales execution. In the quarter, we introduced SmartStrand® Forever Clean™, the next generation of our exclusive franchise, which was selected by retailers at the national flooring trade show in January as the most innovative new product in any flooring category. Forever Clean combines SmartStrand’s luxurious softness and exceptional durability with exclusive Nanoloc™ spill protection for quick and easy clean-up. The company continued to expand its Continuum™ polyester offering, which is gaining momentum across all price points. In commercial carpet, the business improved both top line growth and margins as a result of enhanced design, productivity improvements and material optimization. 

Ceramic segment net sales for the quarter were $744 million, up 1% over last year as reported or 7% at a constant exchange rate. The segment’s adjusted operating income grew 16% over the prior year, even with the impact of the declining euro and ruble; and the margin increased 150 basis points due to increased productivity as well as improved pricing and mix. In the U.S., the combined Dal-Tile and Marazzi organization is operating exceptionally well. The consolidated organization has enhanced the styling of our new products as we expand our offering of larger tile sizes, rectangles and planks, increasing our product mix and average selling prices. The company’s new ceramic plant in Tennessee is on track to start up in the beginning of next year, with the building pad nearly complete. The company’s ceramic sales in Mexico are growing rapidly from providing a complete product line of higher styled premium products and value priced products as well as expanding participation in the retail and new construction channels. Sales and margins in the company’s European ceramic business grew by improving product mix, replacing inefficient manufacturing assets and reducing SG&A. Ceramic sales in Russia expanded significantly in local currency as consumers purchased ahead of anticipated price increases. 

Laminate and Wood segment net sales for the quarter were $459 million, decreasing approximately 2% over last year as reported and increasing 4% at a constant exchange rate. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was approximately 12%, growing 30 basis points over the prior year. Laminate sales in Europe benefited from the rapid acceptance of the new Quick-Step® Impressive™ collection with enhanced surface texture and water repellency. Construction of the company’s LVT plant in Belgium has been completed, and the start-up is focused on new product development. During the period, the company purchased a New Zealand flooring distributor, which expands the company’s distribution model successfully executed in the U.K., Eastern Europe and Australia. The integration of Spano into the company’s European board business 

is largely complete, creating improved mix, increased operational efficiencies and reduced SG&A costs. In the U.S., wood flooring sales grew, with engineered wood sales rising substantially, while laminate sales were impacted by lower mix, product changes and inventory reductions by our customers.

We anticipate stronger organic growth on a local basis in 2015, driven by improvements in the U.S. economy and the flooring market. In the U.S., rising consumer confidence supported by lower gasoline prices, low interest rates, increased home values and an improving job market should drive higher growth in our category. The U.S. dollar has recently strengthened considerably relative to the euro, ruble and other currencies and our translated results will be impacted. While we cannot affect the exchange rates, we are aggressively implementing productivity initiatives, SG&A reductions and other cost containment projects to minimize the impact. We will continue to invest in product innovation and operational improvements to drive our top line growth and margins. The first quarter of 2015 has four additional days, increasing sales 6%, and the fourth quarter will have four less days than in the same periods last year. Taking all of these factors into account, our guidance for first quarter earnings is $1.54 to $1.63 per share, excluding any restructuring charges and new acquisitions. 

In January, we announced the continuation of our aggressive acquisition strategy with the purchase of the IVC Group, and we anticipate that the transaction will close early in the second quarter. Recently, we also signed an agreement to purchase a small Eastern European ceramic manufacturer, with the transaction expected to be completed in the second quarter. We have a strong foundation for future growth in all flooring categories in North America, Europe, Russia, Asia and Australia as we enhance our position as the world’s largest flooring manufacturer.

The Company believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP and the above non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of the Company's business for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. In particular, the Company believes excluding the impact of restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs is useful because it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.
