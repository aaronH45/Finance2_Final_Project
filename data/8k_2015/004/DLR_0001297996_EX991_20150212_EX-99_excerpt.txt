San Francisco, Calif. (February 12, 2015) -- Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: DLR), a leading global provider of data center and colocation solutions, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2014. All per share results are presented on a fully-diluted share and unit basis. 

Highlights[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Reiterated 2015 core FFO per share outlook of $5.00 - $5.10.

Financial Results

Revenues were $412 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, consistent with the previous quarter and an 8% increase over the same quarter last year. 

Revenues were $1.6 billion for the full-year 2014, a 9% increase over 2013. 

Adjusted EBITDA was $242 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, a 3% increase over the previous quarter and a 7% increase over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $944 million for the full-year 2014, a 7% increase over 2013.

Funds from operations (“FFO”) on a diluted basis was $195 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, or $1.40 per share, compared to $1.22 per share in the third quarter of 2014 and $1.26 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

FFO per share for the full-year 2014 was $5.04 compared to $4.74 in 2013, a 6% increase.

Excluding certain items that do not represent core expenses or revenue streams, fourth quarter of 2014 core FFO was $1.26 per share compared to $1.22 per share in the third quarter of 2014, and $1.26 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. Core FFO per share for the full-year 2014 was $4.96 per share compared to $4.78 per share in 2013, a 4% increase.

Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $35 million, and net loss available to common stockholders was $52 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $0.80 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014 and $0.33 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013. The net loss during the fourth quarter of 2014 was primarily attributable to a $114 million impairment charge, discussed in further detail under the Investment Activity section below. For the full-year 2014, net income was $203 million, and net income available to common shareholders was $133 million, or $1.00 per share, compared to $2.12 per share for 2013. 

Leasing Activity

“Demand for our data center solutions remains robust, as evidenced by new lease signings of $46 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue,” commented Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Bill Stein. 

“We made significant progress leasing up finished inventory during the fourth quarter, contributing to further improvement in our return on invested capital. The data center supply environment has largely rationalized, leading to a gradual recovery in landlord leasing economics.” 

The weighted-average lag between leases signed during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the contractual commencement date was 5.5 months. 

In addition to new leases signed, Digital Realty also signed renewal leases representing $23 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue during the quarter, bringing the full-year 2014 total to $105 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. Rental rates on renewal leases signed during the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 6% on a cash basis and 21% on a GAAP basis.

Management Statements on Non-GAAP Measures Financial Supplement

 Fourth Quarter 2014

Funds from Operations (FFO): 

We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, impairment charges, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs’ FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. 

Core Funds from Operations:

We present core funds from operations, or core FFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, in excluding certain items that do not reflect core revenue or expense streams, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in our core business operating performance. We calculate core FFO by adding to or subtracting from FFO (i) termination fees and other non-core revenues, (ii) gain on insurance settlement, (iii) gain on sale of investment, (iv) significant transaction expenses, (v) loss from early extinguishment of debt, (vi) straight-line rent expense adjustment attributable to prior periods, (vii) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (viii) equity in earnings adjustment for non-core items, (ix) severance accrual and equity acceleration and (x) other non-core expense adjustments. Because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of core FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate core FFO in a consistent manner. Accordingly, our core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' core FFO. Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.

Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO): 

We present adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, when compared year over year, it assesses our ability to fund dividend and distribution requirements from our operating activities. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, AFFO will be used by investors as a basis to assess our ability to fund dividend payments in comparison to other REITs, including on a per share and unit basis. We calculate AFFO by adding to or subtracting from FFO (i) non-real estate depreciation, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, (iii) amortization of debt discount, (iv) non-cash compensation, (v) deferred compensation related to equity acceleration, (vi) loss from early extinguishment of debt, (vii) straight line rents, net, (viii) non-cash straight-line rent expense adjustment, (ix) above-and below-market rent amortization, (x) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (xi) gain on sale of investment, (xii) capitalized leasing compensation, (xiii) recurring capital expenditures and (xiv) capitalized internal leasing commissions. Other REITs may not calculate AFFO in a consistent manner. Accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs’ AFFO. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: 

We believe that earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and impairment of investments in real estate, or EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), are useful supplemental performance measures because they allow investors to view our performance without the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization or the cost of debt and, with respect to Adjusted EBITDA, change in fair value of contingent consideration, severance accrual and equity acceleration, gain on sale of property, gain on contribution of properties to unconsolidated joint venture, gain on sale of equity investment, noncontrolling interests, and preferred stock dividends. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA excluding change in fair value of contingent consideration, severance accrual and equity acceleration, impairment of investments in real estate, gain on sale of property, gain on contribution of properties to unconsolidated joint venture, gain on sale of equity investment, noncontrolling interests, and preferred stock dividends. In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes, exclude capitalized costs, such as leasing commissions, and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business, their utility as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do; accordingly, our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to such other REITs’ EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our financial performance. 

Net Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOI:

Net operating income, or NOI, represents rental revenue and tenant reimbursement revenue less rental property operating and maintenance expenses, property taxes and insurance expenses (as reflected in the statement of operations). NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measurement of operating performance of the company’s rental portfolio. Cash NOI is NOI less straight-line rents and above and below market rent amortization. Cash NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measure of property operating performance on a cash basis. However, because NOI and cash NOI exclude depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of NOI and cash NOI as measures of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate NOI and cash NOI in the same manner we do and, accordingly, our NOI and cash NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs’ NOI and cash NOI. Accordingly, NOI and cash NOI should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as measures of our performance.

Additional Definitions

Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated using total debt at balance sheet carrying value less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents divided by the product of Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by four.

Debt-plus-preferred-to-total-enterprise-value is mortgage debt and other loans plus preferred stock divided by mortgage debt and other loans plus the liquidation value of preferred stock and the market value of outstanding Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units, assuming the redemption of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units for shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock.

Fixed charge coverage ratio is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the sum of GAAP interest expense, capitalized interest, scheduled debt principal payments and preferred dividends. For the quarter ended December 31, 2014, GAAP interest expense was $46 million, capitalized interest was $5 million and scheduled debt principal payments and preferred dividends was $21 million.

The risks included here are not exhaustive, and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance. We discussed a number of additional material risks in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, as amended, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those risks continue to be relevant to our performance and financial condition. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
