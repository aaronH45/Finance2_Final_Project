(NEE), and Executive Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Florida Power & Light Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NEE, advised NEE's Board of Directors (Board) of his intention to retire in the spring of 2016 as part of a planned leadership succession process. 

(d)On February 12, 2015, NEE's Board approved an increase in the size of the Board from twelve members to thirteen members and, upon the recommendation of the Governance & Nominating Committee, appointed Amy B. Lane to fill the newly created directorship. In addition, effective on the same date, the Board approved the appointment of Ms. Lane to the Finance & Investment Committee of the Board. It is expected that Ms. Lane will be appointed to the Compensation Committee of the Board effective immediately after the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders.

Ms. Lane was a Managing Director and Group Leader of the Global Retailing Investment Banking Group at Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., from 1997 until her retirement in 2002. Ms. Lane previously served as a Managing Director at Salomon Brothers, Inc., where she founded and led the retail industry investment banking unit. Ms. Lane is a director of GNC Holdings, Inc. and The TJX Companies, Inc. and a trustee of Urban Edge Properties.

Ms. Lane will receive compensation for her service as a director consistent with the compensation paid to the other non-employee directors of NEE, as described in NEE’s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A for NEE’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 4, 2014. The compensation includes an annual retainer of $75,000 and a grant of 1,310 shares of NEE common stock under the NextEra Energy, Inc. 2007 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan which was awarded to Ms. Lane upon her appointment to the Board. These shares are not transferable until Ms. Lane ceases to be a member of the Board and are subject to forfeiture if she ceases to be a member of the Board within five years of her initial appointment, other than by reason of her death, disability or attainment of the Board’s mandatory retirement age.
