  Item 8.01.   Other Events    

On January 16, 2015, we entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the “Stipulation”) reflecting the previously disclosed terms of the settlement of the consolidated stockholder class action, entitled In re Jefferies Group, Inc. Shareholders Litigation, Consolidated C.A. No. 8059-CB, relating to the March 1, 2013 transaction through which Jefferies Group LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary. While we and the other defendants continue to deny each of the plaintiffs’ claims and deny any liability, we agreed to the settlement solely to resolve the disputes, to avoid the costs and risks of further litigation and to avoid further distractions to our management. The terms of the settlement agreement are subject to court approval, the hearing date for which is March 25, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. at the Delaware Court of Chancery. 

A copy of the Notice of Pendency and Proposed Settlement of Class Action, Settlement Fairness Hearing and Right to Appear, and the Stipulation are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively.
