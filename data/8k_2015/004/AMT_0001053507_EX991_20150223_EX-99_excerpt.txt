Boston, Massachusetts – February 23, 2015: American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2014.   

Jim Taiclet, American Tower’s Chief Executive Officer stated, “In 2014, our rental and management segment revenues topped $4 billion for the first time in our history, a 22% increase over the prior year. Our solid top line growth was driven by a combination of continued network expansion and modernization by our tenants around the world, and by our successful construction and acquisition programs, which together added nearly 8,500 new sites in 2014.  

Moreover, our recently announced transactions with Verizon, Telecom Italia, and Bharti Airtel are expected to close in the first half of 2015 and will further enhance our strategic positioning in the U.S., Latin America and Africa. We expect that these assets will both strengthen and lengthen the company’s growth trajectory for years to come, as well as advance our global strategy of expanding our business relationships with the world’s leading mobile operators.”

FULL YEAR 2015 OUTLOOK  

The following estimates are based on a number of assumptions that management believes to be reasonable and reflect the Company’s expectations as of February 23, 2015. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of various factors, and the Company refers you to the cautionary language regarding “forward-looking” statements included in this press release when considering this information.  

Our current full year 2015 outlook excludes the impact of the pending Verizon, TIM and Airtel transactions. Once closed, we expect the annualized year one contributions from the transactions to be as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company’s outlook is based on the following average foreign currency exchange rates to 1.00 U.S. Dollar for the full year 2015: (a) 2.75 Brazilian Reais; (b) 630.00 Chilean Pesos; (c) 2,400.00 Colombian Pesos; (d) 0.90 Euros; (e) 3.50 Ghanaian Cedi; (f) 62.50 Indian Rupees; (g) 14.75 Mexican Pesos; (h) 3.10 Peruvian Soles; (i) 11.65 South African Rand; and (j) 2,900.00 Ugandan Schillings.  

A 5% fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate assumptions versus the rates assumed in the Company’s 2015 outlook would result in an impact of approximately $72 million in revenues, approximately $39 million in Adjusted EBITDA and approximately $35 million in AFFO, relative to the midpoints of the Company’s 2015 outlook.

Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures  

In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, the Company has presented the following non-GAAP and defined financial measures: Gross Margin, Operating Profit, Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, NAREIT Funds From Operations, AFFO, AFFO per Share, Core Growth, Organic Core Growth, New Property Core Growth and Net Leverage Ratio. The Company uses Funds From Operations as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), referred to herein as NAREIT Funds From Operations.  

The Company defines Gross Margin as revenues less operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations, depreciation, amortization and accretion, selling, general, administrative and development expense, and other operating expenses. The Company defines Operating Profit as Gross Margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. For reporting purposes, the international rental and management segment Operating Profit and Gross Margin also include interest income, TV Azteca, net. These measures of Gross Margin and Operating Profit are also before interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest, income (loss) on equity method investments and income tax benefit (provision). The Company defines Operating Profit Margin as the percentage that results from dividing Operating Profit by revenue. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income (loss) from discontinued operations, net, income (loss) from equity method investments, income tax benefit (provision), other income (expense), gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion and stock-based compensation expense. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as the percentage that results from dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. NAREIT Funds From Operations is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends declared on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interest. The Company defines AFFO as NAREIT Funds From Operations before (i) straight-line revenue and expense, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) the non-cash portion of our tax provision, (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges, (vi) other income (expense), (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, (viii) other operating income (expense), and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interest, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. The Company defines AFFO per Share as AFFO divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The Company defines Core Growth in total rental and management revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO as the increase or decrease, expressed as a percentage, resulting from a comparison of financial results for a current period with corresponding financial results for the corresponding period in a prior year, in each case, excluding the impact of straight-line revenue and expense recognition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and significant one-time items. The Company defines Organic Core Growth in rental and management revenue as the increase or decrease, expressed as a percentage, resulting from a comparison of financial results for a current period with corresponding financial results for the corresponding period in a prior year, in each case, excluding the impact of straight-line revenue and expense recognition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, significant one-time items and revenue associated with new properties that the Company has added to the portfolio since the beginning of the prior period. The Company defines New Property Core Growth in rental and management revenue as the increase or decrease, expressed as a percentage, on the properties the Company has added to its portfolio since the beginning of the prior period, in each case, excluding the impact of straight-line revenue and expense recognition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and significant one-time items. The Company defines Net Leverage Ratio as net debt (total debt, less cash and cash equivalents) divided by last quarter annualized Adjusted EBITDA. These measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the Company’s core businesses. The Company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure. Depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors, including historical cost bases, are involved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company’s measures of Gross Margin, Operating Profit, Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, NAREIT Funds From Operations, AFFO, AFFO per Share, Core Growth, Organic Core Growth, New Property Core Growth and Net Leverage Ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.  

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to statements regarding our full year 2015 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and our expectation regarding the leasing demand for communications real estate. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results, and we cannot control that demand; (2) if our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected; (3) increasing competition for tenants in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect our pricing; (4) competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria; (5) our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do; (6) our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us; (7) failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired or leased assets, including from the proposed Verizon transaction, into our operations may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition; (8) our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk; (9) our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (10) a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of  

7  

 tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants; (11) new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues; (12) if we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available; (13) complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities; (14) certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which reduce our cash flows and may create deferred and contingent tax liabilities; (15) we may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements; (16) if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results; (17) if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from such towers will be eliminated; (18) restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our preferred stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT; (19) our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated; (20) we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws; and (21) our towers, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage. For additional information regarding factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information contained in Item 1A of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014.
