 Commenting on the quarter, Arthur Coppola chairman and chief executive officer of Macerich stated, "Our solid leasing momentum continued into year-end, with additional occupancy gains and accelerating releasing spreads. In addition, we continued to execute on our deep pipeline of value-add redevelopment and expansion projects while also completing a number of significant transactions which further improved the quality and growth prospects of our portfolio. In particular, we are very pleased to have increased our ownership of five top super regional malls through a common stock for asset exchange with our long-time joint venture partner the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board."  

  Developments:  

 At Tysons Corner Center, the Company's 2.1 million square foot super regional mall, construction continues on the multifamily and hotel components of this mixed use project which will add 1.4 million square feet to one of the country's premier retail centers. The Tysons expansion includes a 527,000 square foot office tower with major tenants Intelsat and Deloitte which opened in August. The office building is currently over 80% leased. A 30-story, 430-unit luxury residential tower; and a 300-room Hyatt Regency hotel are under construction with completion slated in early 2015.  

 At Broadway Plaza, in Walnut Creek, California, a major redevelopment, including a 235,000 square foot expansion, is underway. This 774,000 square foot mall (pre-expansion) is anchored by Macy's, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. The expansion will open in phases starting in fall 2015.  

 At both Los Cerritos Center and Scottsdale Fashion Square, expansions are underway to add a Dick's Sporting Goods store and a Harkins Theatre. Both projects are planned for completion in the second half of 2015.  

  Financing:  

 In December, the Company paid off a $156.2 million, 6.76% interest rate loan on Fresno Fashion Fair and a $98 million, 5.8% interest rate loan on Vintage Faire Mall. The Company incurred prepayment penalties totaling $9.1 million related to these early debt extinguishments. The Company has arranged a $280 million, eleven year fixed rate loan on Vintage Faire Mall. The interest rate is 3.49% and the transaction is expected to close in March, 2015.  

  Acquisitions:  

 In November, 2014 the Company closed on the acquisition of its joint venture partner's 49% interest in Queens Center, Washington Square, Los Cerritos Center, Stonewood Center and Lakewood Center from a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board. Total consideration was approximately $1.8 billion (USD), including the assumption of $672 million of property-level debt. The balance was funded through the direct issuance to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board of approximately 17.1 million shares of Macerich common stock, representing a 10.9% common ownership stake in the Company.  

 Also in November, the Company closed on the acquisition of joint venture partner AWE Talisman's 40% interest in Fashion Outlets of Chicago for $70 million. With this purchase, Macerich now owns 100% of the recently-developed, 529,000 square foot center which was completed in August 2013 and, as of December 31, 2014, was 94.4% occupied with annual tenant sales of $651 per square foot.  

  Dispositions:  

 In October, the Company sold South Towne Center in Sandy, Utah for $205 million. This 1.2 million square foot mall had annual tenant sales of $344 per square foot.  

 Also, during the quarter, the Company sold its 67.5% interest in Camelback Colonnade, a community center in Phoenix, Arizona. The Company's proceeds from this transaction totaled $61.2 million. These transactions increased the Company's 2014 dispositions of non-core assets to $360 million.

(a)In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance that amends the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals that represent strategic shifts that have, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. Previously, the Company had reported all disposed properties that qualified as discontinued operations. The Company early adopted this accounting pronouncement in the first quarter of 2014. As a result, the Company's results of operations for all 2014 property disposals are presented within income from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations. 

(b)This represents the outside partners' allocation of net income in the Chandler Fashion Center/Freehold Raceway Mall joint venture. 

(c)The Macerich Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership" or the "OP") has operating partnership units ("OP units"). OP units can be converted into shares of Company common stock. Conversion of the OP units not owned by the Company has been assumed for purposes of calculating FFO per share and the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The computation of average shares for FFO—diluted includes the effect of share and unit-based compensation plans, stock warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method. It also assumes conversion of MACWH, LP preferred and common units to the extent they are dilutive to the calculation. 

(d)The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO-diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  

FFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). The Company believes that FFO on a diluted basis is a measure investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities. The Company further believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs.

  Reconciliation of EBITDA to Same Centers—Net Operating Income ("NOI"):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(e)EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, noncontrolling interests, extraordinary items, gain (loss) on remeasurement, sale or write down of assets and preferred dividends and includes joint ventures at their pro rata share. Management considers EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps investors understand the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. The Company believes that EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. The Company also cautions that EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.   

(f)The Company presents same center NOI because the Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate the operating performance of comparable centers. Same center NOI is calculated using total EBITDA and subtracting out EBITDA from non-comparable centers and eliminating the management companies and the Company's general and administrative expenses. Same center NOI excludes the impact of straight-line and above/below market adjustments to minimum rents.
