Exhibit 99.1  

McKESSON REPORTS FISCAL 2015 THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS  

   •   Revenues of $47 billion for the third quarter, up 37%.  

   •   Third-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.01, up 187%.  

   •   Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.89, up 95%.  

   •   Fiscal 2015 Outlook: Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $10.80 to $10.95, up from previous outlook of $10.50 to $10.90.  

SAN FRANCISCO, February 5, 2015 – McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the third quarter ended December 31, 2014 were $47.0 billion, up 37% compared to $34.3 billion a year ago. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), third-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.01 compared to $0.70 a year ago.   

“I am pleased by the strong performance of our business for the first nine months of our fiscal year. We have raised our outlook for the year and now expect Adjusted Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.80 to $10.95 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015. McKesson’s third-quarter results reflect solid execution across our business,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer.  

Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $2.89, up 95% compared to $1.48 a year ago. Third-quarter results benefitted from the pull forward of earnings generated by our branded portfolio of products previously anticipated in the fourth quarter and a lower than expected tax rate driven by the enactment of recent legislation.  

For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $1.2 billion, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 billion. Through nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson  

1  

 paid $171 million in dividends, had internal capital spending of $405 million, and spent $40 million on acquisitions.  

Segment Results  

Distribution Solutions revenues were $46.3 billion, up 38% on a reported basis and 39% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, mainly driven by the contribution from our acquisition of Celesio and market growth.  

North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues, which include results from U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Canada and McKesson Specialty Health, were up 17% on a reported and constant currency basis for the quarter, reflecting market growth including growth from existing customers and continued demand for recently launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C.  

International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.3 billion, an increase of 7% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant currency basis.  

Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were up 7% for the quarter, driven by market growth.  

In the third quarter, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $785 million and GAAP operating margin was 1.70%. Third-quarter adjusted operating profit was $1,043 million and the adjusted operating margin was 2.26%.  

Technology Solutions revenues were $755 million, down 7% in the third quarter compared to the prior year, driven by anticipated revenue softness from the Horizon clinical software platform and the planned elimination of a product line, partially offset by growth in other technology businesses. GAAP operating profit was $111 million for the third quarter and GAAP operating margin was 14.70%. Adjusted operating profit was $123 million for the third quarter and adjusted operating margin was 16.29%.  

Fiscal Year 2015 Outlook  

McKesson expects Adjusted Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations between $10.80 and $10.95 for the fiscal year ending March 31,  

2  

 2015, based on an updated full year average exchange rate of $1.29 per Euro, which excludes the following GAAP items:  

   •   Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $1.48 per diluted share.  

   •   Acquisition expenses and related adjustments of 63 cents per diluted share.  

   •   LIFO inventory-related charges of 97 cents to $1.07 per diluted share.  

Adjusted Earnings  

McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments, and Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A reconciliation of McKesson’s financial results determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted Earnings is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

Definitions related to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) Financial Information  

Adjusted Earnings represents income from continuing operations, excluding the effects of the following items from the Company’s GAAP financial results, including the related income tax effects:  

Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with acquisitions by the Company.  

Acquisition expenses and related adjustments - Transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to acquisitions by the Company. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments, employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency contracts, and gains or losses on business combinations.  

Litigation reserve adjustments - Adjustments to the Company’s reserves, including accrued interest, for estimated probable losses for its Average Wholesale Price litigation matter, as such term is defined in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014.  

LIFO-related adjustments - Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments.  

Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Income Taxes,” which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.  

The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted Earnings provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its core operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted Earnings assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company’s Adjusted Earnings measure may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.  

The Company internally uses non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted Earnings in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business performance and employee incentive compensation. Nonetheless, non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
