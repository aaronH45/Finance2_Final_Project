AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION PRICES CONCURRENT PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF  

COMMON STOCK AND MANDATORY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  

Boston, Massachusetts – February 26, 2015: American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today announced the pricing of its concurrent registered public offerings of 23,500,000 shares of common stock at $97.00 per share and 12,500,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of 5.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B, at $100.00 per depositary share. The underwriters of each offering have an option to purchase up to an additional 2,350,000 shares of common stock and an additional 1,250,000 depositary shares, as applicable, to cover over-allotments, if any. The net proceeds of the common stock offering and depositary shares offering are expected to be approximately $2.22 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively (or approximately $2.44 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full) after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. American Tower expects to use the net proceeds from these offerings, together with cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, to finance the recently announced Verizon transaction and to pay related fees and expenses. If for any reason the Verizon transaction is not completed, American Tower expects to use the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of other pending acquisitions or the repayment of existing indebtedness.  

Unless converted or redeemed earlier, each share of 5.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B, will convert automatically on February 15, 2018, into between 8.5911 and 10.3093 shares of the American Tower’s common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Dividends on the shares of 5.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B, will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by American Tower’s board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof), at an annual rate of 5.50% on the liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share (and, correspondingly, $100.00 per share with respect to the depositary shares), on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2015, to, and including, February 15, 2018.
