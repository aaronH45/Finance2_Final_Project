Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On January 13, 2015, Mohawk Industries, Inc. (the “Company”) and its subsidiary, Unilin BVBA (“Purchaser”), entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with Enterhold S.A., a Luxembourg limited liability company (the “Seller”), International Flooring Systems S.A., a Luxembourg limited liability company (the “IVC Group”), and, for certain limited purposes, Filiep Balcaen, an individual resident of Belgium.

Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, Purchaser or its assignee will acquire all of the outstanding shares of the IVC Group from the Seller. The IVC Group is a global manufacturer, distributor and marketer of luxury vinyl tile with estimated 2014 revenues of approximately $700 million.

At the closing of the transaction, the Company will pay the Seller a purchase price based on an enterprise value of €1.008 billion. The purchase price is subject to adjustment at the closing of the transaction based on the amounts of indebtedness and cash, in each case as of December 31, 2014, as well as the value of certain management retention and incentive payments, transaction expenses of the IVC Group and certain other deductions to arrive at the equity value.

 €100 million of the purchase price will be paid with 805,811 shares of the Company’s $.01 par value per share common stock (the “Company Shares”) and the balance of the purchase price will be paid in cash.

The Share Purchase Agreement includes representations, warranties and covenants of each party customary for the acquisition of a private company. The Seller has agreed to remain liable for general representations, warranties and covenants for 18 months following the closing of the transaction, and for certain fundamental representations and warranties indefinitely. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the Share Purchase Agreement and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the Company and the Seller as set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement. Moreover, the representations and warranties may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may differ from what may be viewed as material to stockholders, or may serve the purpose of allocating risk between the Company and the Seller rather than establishing matters as facts. For the foregoing reasons, no person should rely on such representations and warranties as statements of factual information at the time they were made or otherwise. In addition, the Share Purchase Agreement provides that the parties may terminate the transaction by mutual agreement.

The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and approval of the transaction by the relevant competition authorities.

The foregoing description of the Share Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Share Purchase Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

The information set forth in Item 8.01 is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

The agreement to issue and sell the Company Shares was entered into pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The information set forth in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.
