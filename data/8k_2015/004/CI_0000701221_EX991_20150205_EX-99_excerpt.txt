CIGNA REPORTS STRONG 2014 RESULTS, EXPECTS 8%-10% REVENUE GROWTH IN 2015 

      o   Consolidated revenues for 2014 increased 8% to $34.9 billion    

      o   Adjusted income from operations1 for 2014 was $2.0 billion, or $7.43 per share    

      o   Shareholders’ net income for 2014 was $2.1 billion, or $7.83 per share    

      o   Consolidated revenues and adjusted income from operations1,2 are expected to grow in 2015    

BLOOMFIELD, CT, February 5, 2015 – Cigna Corporation (NYSE: CI) today reported strong fourth quarter and full year 2014 results with each of the Company's business segments posting revenue and earnings growth over the prior year. 

Consolidated revenues for 2014 were $34.9 billion, an increase of 8% over 2013. Revenues reflect growth in premiums and fees of 7% in Global Health Care, 14% in Global Supplemental Benefits and 6% in Group Disability and Life, primarily driven by continued growth in Cigna's targeted customer segments. 

Cigna's adjusted income from operations1 for full year 2014 was $2.0 billion, or $7.43 per share, compared with $1.93 billion, or $6.79 per share, for 2013. This represents per share growth of 9% and reflects strong revenue growth, continued effective medical cost management and disciplined expense management. For the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted income from operations1 was $446 million, or $1.69 per share, compared to $387 million, or $1.39 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2013. 

 “We continue to leverage Cigna's capabilities across our diversified businesses, effectively deploy capital, and deliver personalized and innovative solutions in existing and new growth markets to create sustained, long-term value,” said David M. Cordani, President and Chief Executive Officer. 

Cigna also reported shareholders’ net income in 2014 of $2.1 billion, or $7.83 per share, compared to $1.48 billion, or $5.18 per share, for 2013. Shareholders’ net income in 2013 included special items1 which resulted in after-tax charges of $622 million, or $2.19 per share. 

For the fourth quarter of 2014, shareholders’ net income was $467 million, or $1.77 per share, compared with $361 million, or $1.29 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter 2013 shareholders’ net income included a special item1 charge of $40 million after-tax, or $0.15 per share, related to costs associated with an organizational efficiency plan.

Notes: 

      1.   Adjusted income (loss) from operations is defined as segment earnings (loss) excluding (i) special items, (ii) the results of Cigna's Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits (GMIB) business, and (iii) beginning in 2015, amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Segment earnings (loss) is defined as shareholders’ net income (loss) before net realized investment results. Special items are included in shareholders’ net income and segment earnings (loss), but excluded from adjusted income (loss) from operations. Special items are identified in Exhibit 2 of this earnings release.    

Adjusted income (loss) from operations is a measure of profitability used by Cigna’s management because it presents the underlying results of operations of Cigna’s businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and shareholders’ net income. This measure is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are segment earnings (loss) on a segment basis and shareholders’ net income on a consolidated basis; see Exhibit 2 for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 

      2.   Management is unable to provide a forward-looking reconciliation of adjusted income (loss) from operations to shareholders’ net income for full year 2015 since future net realized investment results and special items cannot be identified or reasonably estimated at this time.    

      3.   The Company may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time. The Company’s outlook excludes the potential effects of any share repurchases or business combinations that may occur after the date of this earnings release.    

      4.   In connection with U.S. health care reform legislation, the Company ceased offering Limited Medical Benefits products effective December 31, 2013. Therefore, the Company’s medical customer growth for 2014 excludes these products from the 2013 customer numbers. As of December 31, 2013, there were 139,000 customers enrolled in these products.    

      5.   Adjusted margin, after-tax, is calculated by dividing segment earnings (loss) excluding special items by segment revenues. Segment margin is calculated by dividing segment earnings (loss) by segment revenue. For the three month periods ended December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2014, as well as the full year ended December 31, 2014, segment margins were equal to adjusted margins because there were no special items for these periods. For the three months ended December 31, 2013, segment margin was 4.5% for Global Health Care, 4.6% for Global Supplemental Benefits, and 6.8% for Group Disability and Life.    

      6.   Prior period dental membership has been revised to conform to current presentation.    

      7.   Global Health Care medical claims payable are presented net of reinsurance and other recoverables. The gross Global Health Care medical claims payable balance was $2.18 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $2.05 billion as of December 31, 2013.    

      8.   Cigna owns a 50% noncontrolling interest in its China joint venture. Cigna's 50% share of the joint venture’s earnings is reported in Other Revenues using the equity method of accounting under GAAP. As such, the premiums and fees and policy counts for the Global Supplemental Benefits segment do not include the China joint venture.    

      9.   The GMIB business and Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits business, also known as Variable Annuity Death Benefits (VADBe), have been in run-off since 2000. Cigna entered into a definitive agreement with Berkshire Hathaway to exit the GMIB and VADBe businesses, effective February 4, 2013.    

Prior to first quarter of 2014, the GMIB and VADBe businesses were reported within the Runoff Reinsurance segment. Beginning with the first quarter of 2014, Cigna reports its run-off reinsurance business in Other Operations. In addition, in this earnings release, Other Operations and Corporate have been combined under the heading “Corporate and Other Operations.” Prior year information has been conformed to the current presentation. 

7 

  10.   2015 projected operating ratios exclude pending business combinations and are defined as follows:    

      ·   Full year Total Commercial medical care ratio represents medical claims expense as a percentage of premiums for all commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally.    

      ·   Full year Total Government medical care ratio represents medical claims expense as a percentage of premiums for Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and Medicaid products.    

      ·   Full year Global Health Care Operating Expense Ratio represents operating expenses excluding acquisition related amortization expense as a percentage of segment revenue in the Global Health Care segment.    

  11.   Global medical customer growth includes individuals who meet any one of the following criteria: are covered under a medical insurance policy or service agreement issued by Cigna; have access to Cigna's provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or have medical claims that are administered by Cigna.
