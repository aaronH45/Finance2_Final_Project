“2014 was a very good year for us. We were successful in achieving our long term target of double digit earnings per share growth and we made good progress with many strategic initiatives. We did a great job of adjusting to very significant changes in North America surface transportation market conditions. Global forwarding was able to continue earning more market share and expanding our global offerings to our customers. We were able to drive positive change and productivity, to serve our customers and providers in more efficient ways,” said John P. Wiehoff, chairman and chief executive officer of C.H. Robinson.  

Our truckload net revenues increased 15.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Our North American truckload volumes increased approximately three percent. Our truckload net revenue margin increased in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, due primarily

 to increased rate per mile. In North America, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel, our average truckload rate per mile charged to our customers increased approximately twelve percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. In North America, our truckload transportation costs increased approximately eleven percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel. These increases were largely the result of market conditions and a change in the mix of our business.  

Our less-than-truckload (“LTL”) net revenues increased 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was driven by a four percent increase in total shipments, and increased customer pricing, partially offset by higher costs.  

Our intermodal net revenues increased 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by increased operational improvements and customer pricing.  

Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 22.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to increased net revenue margin and volumes.  

Our air transportation net revenues increased 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenue margin and volumes.  

Our customs net revenues increased 16.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was due to increased transaction volumes.  

Our other logistics services revenues, which includes managed services, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 4.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to increases in managed services.  

Sourcing net revenues decreased 7.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. This decrease was due to a change in customer, product, and service mix.  

Payment services net revenues increased 32.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. This was primarily due to a rate increase on our cash advance option in July 2014.  

For the fourth quarter, operating expenses increased 8.5 percent to $314.1 million in 2014 from $289.4 million in 2013. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 62.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 65.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

For the fourth quarter, personnel expenses increased 15.5 percent to $235.1 million in 2014 from $203.6 million in 2013. This was primarily due to an increase in the expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability, partially offset by a decrease in our average headcount of 0.6 percent.  

For the fourth quarter, other selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 7.9 percent to $79.0 million in 2014 from $85.7 million in 2013. This was primarily due to a decrease in our allowance for bad debt. During the fourth quarter, we had improvements in our overall accounts receivable portfolio. Additionally, we there were decreases in travel and claims expenses.
