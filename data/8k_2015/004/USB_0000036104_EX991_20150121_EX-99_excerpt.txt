  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Computed as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income excluding net securities gains (losses) and intangible amortization.  

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $1,488 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, 2.2 percent higher than the $1,456 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, and 1.2 percent higher than the $1,471 million for the third quarter of 2014. Diluted earnings per common share of $.79 in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $.03 higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and $.01 higher than the previous quarter. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.50 percent and 14.4 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with 1.62 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2013. The provision for credit losses was lower than net charge-offs by $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, $25 million lower than net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2014, and $35 million lower than net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Richard K. Davis said, “U.S. Bancorp delivered another solid financial performance in 2014 with record full year net income of $5.85 billion, or $3.08 per diluted common share. Our fourth quarter results were also solid with net income of $1.49 billion, or $.79 per diluted common share. We maintained our industry-leading performance measures, including return on average assets (ROA) of 1.54 percent, return on average common equity (ROE) of 14.7 percent, and an efficiency ratio of 53.2 percent for the full year of 2014. We are proud of the hard work and dedication of our global team and for their commitment to providing customers with a diverse array of banking products and services, backed by the financial strength of U.S. Bancorp.”

Davis continued, “In 2014, we demonstrated our ability to create value for our shareholders and customers by returning 72 percent of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, and by generating steady growth in commercial and consumer lending, new credit card accounts, total deposits, and wealth management services. The diversification of our business profile continues to be a key advantage for the organization. We are particularly encouraged by the 5.7 percent growth in total net revenue, the 15.5 percent growth in average total commercial loans, and the 7.2 percent growth in average total deposits over the fourth quarter of last year. At the same time, we are preserving our strong capital position with our key capital ratios at or above our targets.”  

“As we head into 2015, we remain committed to investing in a strategy centered on helping our retail, wholesale and institutional customers establish financially secure futures. We are well positioned for growth as the economic environment shows signs of improvement and our customers look for a strong and stable banking partner to help them achieve their distinct financial goals and objectives.”

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $32 million (2.2 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2013, and $17 million (1.2 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2014.

 The increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue, driven by increases in net interest income and fee-based revenue, and the net impact of notable items. The increase in net income on a linked quarter basis was due to higher net interest income, the net impact of the notable items and a decrease in the provision for credit losses.  

Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $5,169 million, which was $280 million (5.7 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting a 9.9 percent increase in noninterest income and a 2.4 percent increase in net interest income. Noninterest income increased year-over-year due to higher revenue in most fee businesses and higher other income, including the impact of the Nuveen gain. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was the result of an increase in average earning assets and continued growth in lower cost core deposit funding, partially offset by lower loan fees due to the previously communicated wind down of the short-term, small-dollar deposit advance product, Checking Account Advance (“CAA”). Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis was $179 million (3.6 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis due to a 5.7 percent increase in noninterest income as a result of the Nuveen gain and a 1.9 percent increase in net interest income, the result of an increase in average earning assets and growth in lower cost deposits.  

Total noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $2,804 million, which was $122 million (4.5 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and $190 million (7.3 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2014. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to accruals related to recent developments in several legal matters, charitable contributions and an increase in compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions, and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities. The increase in total noninterest expense on a linked quarter basis was due to seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and professional services and the notable items, including the charitable contributions and legal accruals.  

The Company’s provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $288 million, $23 million (7.4 percent) lower than the prior quarter and $11 million (4.0 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. The provision for credit losses was lower than net charge-offs by $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, $25 million lower than net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2014, and $35 million lower than net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2013. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $308 million, compared with $336 million in the third quarter of 2014, and $312 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects the level of net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2015.

Nonperforming assets were $1,808 million at December 31, 2014, compared with $1,923 million at September 30, 2014, and $2,037 million at December 31, 2013. The decrease in nonperforming assets compared with a year ago was driven primarily by reductions in the commercial, commercial mortgage and construction and development portfolios, as well as by improvement in credit card loans. The Company expects total nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2015. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 1.77 percent at December 31, 2014, compared with 1.80 percent at September 30, 2014, and 1.93 percent at December 31, 2013. Certain loans acquired by the Company are covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company (“covered assets”). The loss sharing agreement for the commercial and commercial real estate loans acquired from the FDIC, which comprised the majority of the nonperforming covered assets, expired at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014.

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $2,799 million, an increase of $66 million (2.4 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was the result of growth in average earning assets and in lower cost core deposit funding, partially offset by lower rates on new loans and securities and the CAA product wind down. Average earning assets were $35.4 billion (11.1 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by increases of $20.9 billion (27.1 percent) in average investment securities and $13.6 billion (5.9 percent) in average total loans. Net interest income increased $51 million (1.9 percent) on a linked quarter basis, due to higher average earning assets, partially offset by lower loan and investment securities rates. The net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 3.14 percent, compared with 3.40 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, and 3.16 percent in the third quarter of 2014. The decline in the net interest margin on a year-over-year basis primarily reflected lower reinvestment rates on investment securities, as well as growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, lower loan fees due to the CAA product wind down, and lower rates on new loans, partially offset by lower funding costs. On a linked quarter basis, the reduction in net interest margin was principally due to growth in lower rate investment securities, partially offset by interest recoveries.

  ($ in millions)     

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average total loans were $13.6 billion (5.9 percent) higher in the fourth quarter of 2014 than the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by growth in total commercial loans (15.5 percent), total commercial real estate (4.2 percent), credit card (3.6 percent), residential mortgages (2.2 percent), and total other retail loans (3.6 percent). These increases were partially offset by a decline in covered loans (24.3 percent). Average total loans, excluding covered loans, were higher by 7.1 percent year-over-year. Average total loans were $2.6 billion (1.0 percent) higher in the fourth quarter of 2014 than the third quarter of 2014, driven by growth in total commercial loans (2.9 percent), credit card (1.3 percent), total other retail loans (.8 percent) and total commercial real estate (.3 percent). These increases were partially offset by a decline in covered loans (5.2 percent) and residential mortgages (.2 percent). Average total loans, excluding covered loans, were higher by 1.2 percent on a linked quarter basis.  

Average investment securities in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $20.9 billion (27.1 percent) higher year-over-year and $5.0 billion (5.4 percent) higher than the prior quarter. The increases were primarily due to purchases of U.S. government agency-backed securities, net of prepayments and maturities, in anticipation of final liquidity coverage ratio regulatory requirements.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $18.6 billion (7.2 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.5 billion (3.3 percent) year-over-year, mainly in Consumer and Small Business Banking, including the $.4 billion impact of the Charter One acquisition. Average total savings deposits were $18.2 billion (13.0 percent) higher year-over-year, the result of growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking, including the $3.3 billion impact of the Charter One acquisition, corporate trust, and in Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate balances. Time deposits less than $100,000 were $1.2 billion (10.1 percent) lower due to maturities, while time deposits greater than $100,000 decreased $875 million (2.9 percent), primarily due to a decline in Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate and Consumer and Small Business Banking balances. Time deposits greater than $100,000 are managed as an alternative to other funding sources, such as wholesale borrowing, based largely on relative pricing.  

Average total deposits increased $4.5 billion (1.6 percent) over the third quarter of 2014. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.8 billion (3.8 percent) on a linked quarter basis, due to higher balances in Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate and Consumer and Small Business Banking. Average total savings deposits increased $2.7 billion (1.8 percent), reflecting increases in corporate trust and Consumer and Small Business Banking, partially offset by a decrease in broker-dealer and government banking related balances. Compared with the third quarter of 2014, average time deposits less than $100,000 decreased $279 million (2.5 percent) due to a decrease in Consumer and Small Business Banking. Average

 time deposits greater than $100,000 decreased $831 million (2.7 percent) on a linked quarter basis, principally due to a decline in corporate trust balances.  

  NONINTEREST INCOME   Table 6

Noninterest Income  

Fourth quarter noninterest income was $2,370 million, which was $214 million (9.9 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and $128 million (5.7 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2014. The year-over-year increase in noninterest income was due to increases in other income and a majority of fee revenue categories, partially offset by a reduction in commercial products revenue. The increase in other income of $161 million was primarily due to higher equity investment gains, including the Nuveen gain, and increased revenue from tax-advantaged projects. Trust and investment management fees increased $25 million (8.4 percent) year-over-year, reflecting account growth, improved market conditions and business expansion. Merchant processing services revenue was $17 million (4.6 percent) higher as a result of an increase in product fees and higher volumes, partially offset by lower rates. Credit and debit card revenue increased $9 million (3.4 percent) and corporate payment products revenue increased $8 million (4.8 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to higher transaction volumes. The decrease in commercial products revenue of $24 million (9.9 percent) was primarily due to lower tax-advantaged project syndication fees.  

Noninterest income was $128 million (5.7 percent) higher in the fourth quarter of 2014 than the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to a $141 million (79.7 percent) increase in other income, partially offset by

 lower mortgage banking revenue and seasonally lower corporate payment products revenue. The increase in other income was primarily due to the Nuveen gain and higher revenue from tax-advantaged projects. Credit and debit card revenue increased $21 million (8.4 percent) primarily due to seasonally higher sales volumes. Commercial products revenue increased $10 million (4.8 percent) primarily due to higher loan and tax-advantaged project syndication fees. Trust and investment management fees were $7 million (2.2 percent) higher than the prior quarter due to improved market conditions and higher fees. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in mortgage banking revenue and corporate payment products revenue. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $25 million (9.6 percent), principally due to a decrease in origination and sales revenue and an $8 million unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”), net of hedging activities. Corporate payment products revenue decreased $21 million (10.8 percent) on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to the impact of seasonally higher third quarter government-related transaction volumes.

Noninterest Expense  

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2014 totaled $2,804 million, an increase of $122 million (4.5 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2013, and a $190 million (7.3 percent) increase over the third quarter of 2014. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily the result of the charitable contributions and legal accruals, and higher compensation expense. The increase in compensation expense of $48 million (4.4 percent) reflected the impact of merit increases, acquisitions, and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities. The increase in other noninterest expense of $45 million (9.0 percent) was primarily due to the legal accruals. The increase in marketing and business development expense of $26 million (25.2 percent) was principally due to charitable contributions. Additionally, professional services expense increased $14 million (11.9 percent) due to higher costs across a majority of the lines of business, and technology and communications expense increased $10 million (4.8 percent) as a result of business initiatives across most business lines. Partially offsetting these increases was a $30 million (10.9 percent) reduction in employee benefits expense driven by lower pension costs.  

Noninterest expense increased $190 million (7.3 percent) on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by an increase in other noninterest expense of $91 million (20.1 percent) due to seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and the legal accruals. Additionally, marketing and business development expense increased $51 million (65.4 percent) primarily due to charitable contributions and advertising costs. Professional services expense was $30 million (29.4 percent) higher due to seasonally higher costs across a majority of the lines of business including risk and compliance activities. Compensation expense increased $19 million (1.7 percent) principally reflecting the impact of additional employees for risk and compliance activities.  

Provision for Income Taxes  

The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2014 resulted in a tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis of 27.7 percent (effective tax rate of 25.8 percent), compared with 23.8 percent (effective tax rate of 21.5 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2013, and 28.0 percent (effective tax rate of 26.0 percent) in the third quarter of 2014. The increase on a year-over-year basis primarily reflected the affordable housing tax credit change in the first quarter of 2014 and the favorable conclusion of certain tax matters in the fourth quarter of 2013.

The allowance for credit losses was $4,375 million at December 31, 2014, compared with $4,414 million at September 30, 2014, and $4,537 million at December 31, 2013. Nonperforming assets declined on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis as economic conditions continued to slowly improve. Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $308 million, compared with $336 million in the third quarter of 2014, and $312 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The $28 million (8.3 percent) decrease in net charge-offs on a linked quarter basis was due to higher recoveries in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios and improvement in home equity and second mortgages, while the $4 million (1.3 percent) decrease in net charge-offs on a year-over-year basis reflected improvements in residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages, partially offset by higher commercial loan net charge-offs and lower recoveries in commercial real estate. The Company recorded $288 million of provision for credit losses in the current quarter, which was $20 million less than net charge-offs.  

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were $36 million (.12 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $62 million (.21 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2014, and $7 million (.03 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs were $39 million (.30 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $42 million (.32 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2014, and $49 million (.38 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2013. Credit card loan net charge-offs were $160 million (3.53 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $158 million (3.53 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2014, and $163 million (3.72 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2013. Total other retail loan net charge-offs were $70 million (.57 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $73 million (.59 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2014, and $89 million (.75 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2013.

 (a) 2014 amounts and ratios calculated under the Basel III transitional standardized approach; December 31, 2013, under Basel I  

Prior to 2014, the regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company followed the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel I”). Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by January 1, 2018. Basel III includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets: a general standardized approach and more risk-sensitive advanced approaches. As of April 1, 2014, the Company exited its parallel run qualification period, resulting in its capital adequacy now being evaluated against the Basel III methodology that is most restrictive. Under the Basel III transitional standardized approach, the common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 9.7 percent at December 31, 2014 and at September 30, 2014. The tier 1 capital ratio was 11.3 percent at December 31, 2014 and at September 30, 2014, compared with 11.2 percent at December 31, 2013. Under the Basel III transitional advanced approaches, the common equity tier 1

 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 12.4 percent at December 31, 2014 and at September 30, 2014. All regulatory ratios continue to be in excess of “well-capitalized” requirements. In addition, the common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.0 percent at December 31, 2014 and at September 30, 2014, compared with 8.8 percent at December 31, 2013, and the common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio estimated for the Basel III advanced approaches as if fully implemented was 11.8 percent at December 31, 2014 and at September 30, 2014. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.5 percent at December 31, 2014, compared with 7.6 percent at September 30, 2014, and 7.7 percent at December 31, 2013.

 (a) preliminary data  

Lines of Business  

The Company’s major lines of business are Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate, Consumer and Small Business Banking, Wealth Management and Securities Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line’s operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services, primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within

 noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s diverse customer base. During 2014, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.  

Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital markets, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate contributed $287 million of the Company’s net income in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $289 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $267 million in the third quarter of 2014. Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate’s net income decreased $2 million (.7 percent) from the same quarter of 2013 due to an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in total net revenue, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses. Total net revenue declined by $5 million (.6 percent), due to a 12.8 percent decrease in total noninterest income, partially offset by a 5.9 percent increase in net interest income. Net interest income increased $30 million (5.9 percent) year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in average total loans and deposits, partially offset by lower rates and fees on loans. Total noninterest income decreased by $35 million (12.8 percent), driven by lower wholesale transaction activity and loan-related fees, partially offset by increases in commercial bond underwriting fees. Total noninterest expense was $6 million (2.0 percent) higher compared with a year ago, due to an increase in the FDIC insurance assessment allocation based on the level of commitments and higher net shared services expense. The provision for credit losses was $8 million (32.0 percent) lower year-over-year due to a favorable change in the reserve allocation, partially offset by lower recoveries.  

Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate’s contribution to net income in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $20 million (7.5 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2014, due to an increase in total net revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense. Total net revenue increased by $24 million (3.2 percent) compared with the prior quarter. Net interest income increased by $22 million (4.2 percent) on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to higher average loans and interest recoveries. Total noninterest income was $2 million (.8 percent) higher than the prior quarter primarily due to higher equity investment revenue, partially offset by lower commercial products revenue, including standby letters of credit fees and other loan-related fees. Total noninterest

 expense increased by $5 million (1.6 percent) due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense and seasonally higher net shared services expense. The provision for credit losses decreased by $12 million (41.4 percent) due to higher recoveries, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation.  

Consumer and Small Business Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM processing and mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablet computers. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, in-store banking, small business banking, consumer lending, workplace banking, student banking and 24-hour banking (collectively, the retail banking division), as well as mortgage banking. Consumer and Small Business Banking contributed $305 million of the Company’s net income in the fourth quarter of 2014, an $84 million (21.6 percent) decrease from the fourth quarter of 2013 and a $4 million (1.3 percent) decrease from the prior quarter. Within Consumer and Small Business Banking, the retail banking division reported a 39.9 percent decrease in its contribution from the same quarter of last year, principally due to lower total net revenue and an increase in total noninterest expense. Retail banking’s total net revenue was 5.1 percent lower than the fourth quarter of 2013. Net interest income decreased 7.7 percent, primarily as a result of lower fees due to the wind down of the CAA product, lower rates on loans and the impact of lower rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by higher average loan and deposit balances. Total noninterest income for the retail banking division increased 1.3 percent over a year ago, principally due to an increase in retail lease revenue and deposit service charges. Total noninterest expense for the retail banking division in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 4.4 percent over the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to merger integration costs and higher compensation and employee benefits expense, partially offset by lower FDIC insurance assessments. The provision for credit losses for the retail banking division increased $70 million on a year-over-year basis due to an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation, partially offset by lower net charge-offs. The contribution of the mortgage banking division was higher by 32.7 percent than the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting a reduction in the provision for credit losses and an increase in total net revenue. The division’s 4.0 percent increase in total net revenue was due to a 6.0 percent increase in net interest income, primarily the result of higher average loan and deposit balances, as well as a 2.6 percent increase in total noninterest income, principally due to a favorable change in the valuation of MSRs, net of hedging activities. Total noninterest expense was relatively flat compared with the prior year, as higher mortgage servicing-related expenses were partially offset by lower incentive compensation. The 97.3 percent favorable change in the provision for credit losses for the mortgage banking division was due to a favorable change in the reserve allocation and lower net charge-offs.

 to higher average loan and deposit balances and an increase in the margin benefit of corporate trust deposits.

The business line’s contribution in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $5 million (8.2 percent) higher than the prior quarter.

Total net revenue increased $28 million (2.2 percent) on a linked quarter basis driven by higher net interest income.

Total noninterest income increased by $178 million over the fourth quarter of last year, mainly due to gains on the sales of equity investments and higher commercial products revenue. Total noninterest expense increased by $51 million (18.1 percent), principally due to accruals related to recent developments in several legal matters and charitable contributions, partially offset by a decrease in employee benefits expense resulting from lower pension costs and lower costs for investments in tax-advantaged projects related to a change in accounting for affordable housing investments in the first quarter of 2014.

Forward-Looking Statements  

The following information appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:  

This press release contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date hereof. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. A reversal or slowing of the current economic recovery or another severe contraction could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a downturn in the residential real estate markets could cause credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp’s business and financial performance is likely to be negatively impacted by recently enacted and future legislation and regulation. U.S. Bancorp’s results could also be adversely affected by deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in its investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; breaches in data security; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management’s ability to effectively manage credit risk, residual value risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and reputational risk.  

For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Corporate Risk Profile” contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, factors other than these also could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s results, and the reader should not consider these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:  

   •    Tangible common equity to tangible assets,  

   •    Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets,  

   •    Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets estimated for the Basel III fully implemented standardized approach,  

   •    Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets estimated for the Basel III fully implemented advanced approaches, and for additional information,  

   •    Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets using Basel I definition.  

These measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the numerator includes unrealized gains and losses related to available-for-sale securities and excludes preferred securities, including preferred stock, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not currently effective or defined in federal banking regulations. As a result, these measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.  

There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures.
