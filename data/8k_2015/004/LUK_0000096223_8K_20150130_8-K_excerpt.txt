 Item 5.02. Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On January 30, 2015, our Compensation Committee approved the following bonuses for certain of our executive officers.  

Although achievement of performance targets would have entitled Messrs. Handler and Friedman to receive cash bonuses in the amount of $2.17 million each, after consultation with Messrs. Handler and Friedman, during which Messrs. Handler and Friedman recommended to the Compensation Committee that they receive no cash bonus for fiscal year 2014, the Compensation Committee exercised negative discretion and reduced Messrs. Handler and Friedman’s cash bonus to $0.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition, because net earnings attributable to Jefferies Group LLC fell short of performance targets, the Leucadia Compensation Committee certified that 2014 long-term equity awards to Messrs. Handler and Friedman would be reduced by 67,040 Leucadia shares each.
