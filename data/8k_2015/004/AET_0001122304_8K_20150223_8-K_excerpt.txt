Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

On Friday, February 20, 2015, after the market close, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued its Advance Notice detailing preliminary 2016 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates (the “Advance Notice”). 

At meetings with investors and analysts on February 23, 2015, Aetna Inc. (“Aetna” or the “Company”) expects to disclose that based on Aetna’s preliminary analysis of the Advance Notice, funding for the Company’s Medicare Advantage business would decrease by approximately one percent in 2016. 

Aetna is continuing to evaluate the changes outlined in the Advance Notice and their impact on the Company and its Medicare Advantage members, and will be providing comments to CMS in support of this important program. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- Certain information in this Form 8-K is forward-looking, including our projections as to the 2016 CMS funding for our Medicare Advantage business. Forward-looking information is based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections and is subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, including: our further analysis of the Advance Notice, the responses and commentary of Aetna and other marketplace participants to the information contained in the Advance Notice and the final 2016 Medicare Advantage rates. For more discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect Aetna, please see the risk factors contained in Aetna's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Aetna's 2013 Annual Report") on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). You also should read Aetna’s 2013 Annual Report and Aetna's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, each on file with the SEC, for a discussion of Aetna’s historical results of operations and financial condition.
