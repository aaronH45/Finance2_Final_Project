FLORHAM PARK, NJ, Feb. 11, 2015 - Zoetis Inc.  (NYSE: ZTS) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 and updated its guidance for full year 2015. 

The company reported revenue of $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 5% from the fourth quarter of 2013; revenue reflected an operational2 increase of 9%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $126 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, an increase of 20% and 19% respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted net income1 for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $203 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, an increase of 13% and 11%, respectively. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 excludes the net impact of $77 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. On an operational basis, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 12%, with foreign currency having a positive impact of 1 percentage point. In the fourth quarter, the company benefited from a lower than expected tax rate primarily due to the resolution of prior tax matters and the extension of the R&D tax credit; operational, adjusted pre-tax earnings for the fourth quarter declined 1%.

For full year 2014, the company reported revenue of $4.8 billion, an increase of 5% from the full year 2013. Revenue reflected an operational2 increase of 7%, with foreign currency having a negative impact of 2 percentage points. 

Net income for the full year 2014 was $583 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, an increase of 16% and 15%, respectively, compared to the full year 2013.

the full year 2014 excludes the net impact of $207 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. On an operational basis, adjusted net income for the full year 2014 increased 13%, with foreign currency having a negative impact of 2 percentage points. In the fourth quarter, the company benefited from a lower than expected tax rate primarily due to the resolution of prior tax matters and the extension of the R&D tax credit; operational, adjusted pre-tax earnings for the full year increased 10%.

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

“We completed a very successful year in 2014 as we continue to create value for shareholders, delivering operational growth of 7% in revenue and 13% in adjusted net income for the full year,” said Zoetis Chief Executive Officer Juan Ramón Alaix. “We generated growth across all four of our regional segments for the year based on our market-leading franchises and the continued adoption of our newer products. Our 9% operational growth in our livestock products for the year demonstrated very favorable market conditions for meat and dairy producers, and the value our premium medicines and vaccines bring to protecting animals and improving productivity.”

“On the companion animal side, we grew 4% operationally for the year, mainly driven by the introduction of APOQUEL and growth in emerging markets. This growth was tempered by additional competition in certain key product categories. We expect to see stronger performance in this area in the future as we significantly increase the supply of APOQUEL in April 2015 and continue our investment in discovering, acquiring and launching new products for companion animals.”

“The people of Zoetis take great pride and ownership in serving our customers and delivering results for our shareholders,” concluded Alaix. “As we enter the final stages of our stand-up, we will build on our leadership positions in animal health and continue to improve the efficiency and value of our business model.”

“In 2014, we continued to deliver on our total value proposition for shareholders - growing revenue faster than the market, growing adjusted net income faster than sales, and returning excess capital to our shareholders,” said Paul Herendeen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Zoetis. “We continued to see strong underlying growth in our business in the fourth quarter, and we see good sales momentum as we head into 2015, despite ongoing currency headwinds.” 

“We are updating our full year guidance for 2015 to reflect foreign exchange rates as of late January, the closing of the Abbott Animal Health transaction, and other changes in our operating assumptions for 2015,” said Herendeen. “There continue to be opportunities to grow our revenue and improve our margins over the next few years as we finalize our manufacturing strategy and focus on continuous improvement in our operations.”

QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS

Zoetis organizes and manages its business across four regional operating segments: the United States (U.S.); Europe/Africa/Middle East (EuAfME); Canada/Latin America (CLAR); and Asia/Pacific (APAC). Within each of these regional segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for livestock and companion animals tailored to local trends and customer needs. 

In the fourth quarter of 2014: 

•Revenue in the U.S. was $589 million, an increase of 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales of livestock products grew 19%, led by strong anti-infective sales in cattle. Sales of swine products also saw notable growth as the result of new product introductions. Sales of companion animal products grew 7%, driven by APOQUEL® and other key brands such as CERENIA® and CONVENIA®. Growth was offset by competition to our RIMADYL® franchise and competitive pressure in vaccines and parasiticides. 

•Revenue in EuAfME was $294 million, a decrease of 1% on an operational basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales of livestock products declined 3% operationally as gains in swine products were offset by declines in poultry and cattle. Growth in livestock product sales in southern Europe and Germany were offset primarily by sales declines in the UK and France. Overall, emerging markets saw strong livestock product sales, partially offset by a decline in sales in Russia. Companion animal products generated growth of 2% operationally due to strong APOQUEL sales in Germany and the UK, as well as continued growth across the small animal portfolio of medicines. This growth was tempered by the competitive environment for small animal vaccines in developed markets.

•Revenue in CLAR was $239 million, an increase of 16% operationally compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Overall for the segment, sales of livestock products grew 15% operationally and sales of companion animal products grew 18% operationally. The CLAR segment results were largely driven by growth in Canada, Brazil and Venezuela. Livestock products were driven by cattle sales in Canada as producers are taking advantage of strong profitability in the industry. Swine anti-infective sales also saw positive growth, primarily in Canada and Brazil. Sales of companion animal products benefited from growth in Venezuela and Brazil across all therapeutic areas. 

•Revenue in APAC was $187 million, an increase of 4% operationally compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales of livestock products grew 8% operationally, driven primarily by the growth of swine products in Southeast Asia, and sales of cattle and sheep products in Australia, including the launch of a new parasiticide. Emerging markets performed well across the board, including China, despite soft market conditions in poultry and swine. Sales of companion animal products declined 6% operationally, primarily due to the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan and increased competition in parasiticides. 

Zoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse portfolio of products through product lifecycle development, strong customer relationships and access to new markets and technologies. The company is focused on improving the performance and delivery of its current product lines; expanding product indications across species; pursuing approvals in new geographies; and developing innovative medicines, treatments and solutions for emerging diseases and unmet customer needs.

Some recent highlights include:

•Expanding the portfolio's reach - As part of developing the lifecycle of its products, Zoetis continues to receive approvals that help expand its key products into new markets or with new indications and formulations. In the fourth quarter, for example: 

▪The company received approval of new label claims in the U.S. for DRAXXIN® 25, an injectable anti-infective, which can now be used to treat bovine respiratory disease in small calves. DRAXXIN 25 contains a lower concentration of tulathromycin than standard DRAXXIN, making it easier to dose small calves. DRAXXIN 25 was first approved in the U.S. in November 2013 for treatment of swine respiratory disease (SRD) in nursery pigs by providing a lower concentration and making it optimized for use in small pigs to treat and control SRD. 

▪The company also received approval of additional label claims for its FOSTERA® PRRS vaccine for swine, with reproductive protection licensed in the U.S. FOSTERA PRRS is now licensed for whole herd protection against both the respiratory and reproductive forms of the disease caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus.

▪In the fourth quarter in China, Zoetis launched SUVAXYN® MH-One, a vaccine for swine that was first approved in April 2014, to help in the prevention of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections. This product adds to the company’s broad range of vaccines in the world’s largest market for swine production.

•Strengthening our portfolio with business development - Zoetis recently completed the acquisition of the assets of Abbott Animal Health, a transaction that was announced in the fourth quarter. The products from Abbott focus on the veterinary surgical suite and strengthen Zoetis’ companion animal product portfolio, while expanding its diagnostics business. Zoetis continues to look at acquisitions as an important way to use capital to create long-term value for its shareholders and build more customized solutions for customers.

•Advancing standards of care - Zoetis continues to be viewed as a partner of choice in the industry, advancing standards of animal care by forming research partnerships in areas like precision farming. In the fourth quarter, Zoetis announced its participation in a project with the UK Research Consortium to develop visual imaging methods and digital technologies to help improve the health and wellness of pig herds and enhance production efficiency. 

FINANCIAL GUIDANCE AND COMMENTARY

Zoetis' guidance for full year 2015 reflects the company's confidence in the diversity of its portfolio, the strength of its business model, and its view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year. 

Zoetis originally provided its financial guidance for full year 2015 in November 2014, and has updated guidance today to reflect foreign exchange rates as of late January, the recent completion of its acquisition of the assets of Abbott Animal Health, and other changes in its operating assumptions for 2015:

•Revenue of between $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion

•Reported diluted EPS for the full year of between $1.32 to $1.39 per share 

•Adjusted diluted EPS for the full year between $1.61 to $1.68 per share

Additional guidance on other items such as expenses and tax rate is included in the financial tables and will be discussed on the company's conference call this morning.

(a)Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies.

2015 GUIDANCE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In updating our guidance for full year 2015, we have considered current exchange rates and other factors.

A reconciliation of 2015 adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance to 2015 reported net income attributable to Zoetis and reported diluted EPS guidance follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Reflects the impact of changes between mid-November 2014 and current foreign exchange rates.

(b)Reflects the expected impact of acquiring the assets of Abbott Animal Health, subject to the final purchase price allocation.

(c)Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses, adjusted interest expense and adjusted other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. 

(d)Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to becoming an independent public company, such as new branding (including changes to the manufacturing process for required new packaging), the creation of standalone systems and infrastructure, site separation, certain legal registration and patent assignment costs, as well as other charges.
