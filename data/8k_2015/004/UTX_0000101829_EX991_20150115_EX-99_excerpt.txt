UNITED TECHNOLOGIES ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO AEROSPACE LEADERSHIP AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 

HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 15, 2015 â€“ United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) today announced it will streamline its aerospace organization and leadership structure to provide greater focus on serving customers. 

Alain Bellemare, President & Chief Executive Officer of UTC Propulsion & Aerospace Systems (PAS), has elected to leave the company at the end of the month. He will continue to serve as a consultant to UTC. As a result of Bellemare's decision and the successful integration of Goodrich Corporation, UTC is streamlining its aerospace operations by eliminating the PAS organization. Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems (UTAS), both formerly under the PAS structure, will continue as stand-alone business units. 

"We thank Alain for his long and valuable service to the company. Alain played a key role in the successful integration of Goodrich and in positioning Pratt & Whitney for future success," said UTC President & Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes. "With his departure and the Goodrich integration now largely complete, our new streamlined organization better positions us to serve customers and to focus on ensuring a successful entry into service and production ramp-up of our Geared Turbofan engine and numerous aircraft systems designed and developed by the UTAS team."

As a result of this organizational change, Pratt & Whitney President Paul Adams will report directly to Hayes, as will Dave Gitlin, who has been promoted to President, UTC Aerospace Systems, from his former position as leader of that company's Aircraft Systems segment. 

"Dave has extensive program management experience and business leadership skills," Hayes said. "His strong customer relationships, his focus on program execution and his engaging leadership style will ensure continued growth in our important aerospace systems business." 

Also reporting directly to Hayes will be Mike Dumais, who has been appointed to a new position as UTC Senior Vice President, Strategic Planning. Dumais, who formerly led UTC Aerospace Systems' Power, Controls & Sensing Systems segment, will help assess capital allocation strategies and opportunities for portfolio and organizational changes across the corporation. 

"As I told investors in December, we will review our portfolio in a disciplined and aggressive manner to ensure we continue to deliver increased shareowner value on a sustainable basis," Hayes said. "Mike has 16 years of experience with UTC and his background in strategy, business development and operations makes him uniquely qualified to lead this effort."
