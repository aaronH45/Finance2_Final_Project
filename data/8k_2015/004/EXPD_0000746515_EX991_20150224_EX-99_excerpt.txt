EXPEDITORS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2014 EPS OF $0.51 PER SHARE 1 

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - February 24, 2015, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced net earnings attributable to shareholders of $99,381,000 for the fourth quarter of 2014, as compared with $83,496,000 for the same quarter of 2013, an increase of 19%. Net revenues2 for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 9% to $518,871,000 as compared with $478,072,000 reported for the fourth quarter of 2013. Total revenues and operating income were $1,768,830,000 and $157,871,000 in 2014, as compared with $1,625,859,000 and $133,663,000 for the same quarter of 2013, increases of 9% and 18%, respectively. Diluted net earnings attributable to shareholders per share for the fourth quarter were $0.51, as compared with $0.41 for the same quarter in 2013, an increase of 24%. 

For the year ended December 31, 2014, net earnings attributable to shareholders was $376,888,000, as compared with $348,526,000 in 2013, an increase of 8%. Net revenues for the year increased to $1,981,427,000 from $1,882,853,000 for 2013, up 5%. Total revenues and operating income for the year were $6,564,721,000 and $594,648,000 in 2014, as compared with $6,080,257,000 and $552,073,000 for the same period in 2013, both increases of 8%. Diluted net earnings attributable to shareholders per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $1.92, as compared with $1.68 for the same period of 2013, an increase of 14%. 

“During the 2014 fourth quarter we saw strong year-over-year increases in both air and ocean freight volumes. Despite the 10 basis point reduction in overall net revenue margin, airfreight and ocean freight net revenues both managed double digit increases, up 10% and 11%, respectively, as overall net revenue increased 9%. We think this is significant,” said Bradley S. Powell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “The percentage growth in fourth quarter operating income was substantially in double digits, even when one-time charges in the 2013 fourth quarter are normalized. Operating income as a percentage of net revenue during the 2014 fourth quarter was just above our target of 30%, something we also view as significant. Net earnings per share for the fourth quarter saw a 24% increase, to $.51 per share and was significantly influenced by the $551 million in capital we returned to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks during 2014.” Powell continued.

“These fourth quarter results are a great affirmation of our efforts to date. We’ve worked steadily to improve our performance throughout 2014, being able to see the effects of our focus and concentration reflected this quarter in double digit operating income growth, as well as double digit growth in both air and ocean freight net revenue has provided us with some important positive reinforcement at a very opportune time. This is particularly true in light of a global economy that still struggles to gain traction,” said Jeffrey S. Musser, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to be grateful for the dedication of our people, whose efforts, day in and day out, are what made these results happen. We would be particularly remiss not to acknowledge the long hours and extraordinary efforts by our ocean team to assist our customers in working through a most difficult and challenging ocean freight environment caused by the US West Coast labor situation,” Musser went on to say. “While this year has been one of change at Expeditors, the impact of greater synergies among the various parts of our internal and external network is becoming increasingly more visible. As we work to embrace new strategies and adapt to new organizational structures, we are already seeing the benefits of more global consistency and greater accountability, all which are necessary for us to achieve our strategic goals. While we still have much to do in fully implementing our strategic assessment, we feel good about moving into 2015 with the momentum created in the last several quarters," Musser concluded.

The company employs trained professionals in 186 full-service offices and numerous satellite locations located on six continents linked into a seamless worldwide network through an integrated information management system.

Net Revenues (Non-GAAP measure)

We commonly refer to the term “net revenues” when commenting about our Company and the results of its operations. Net revenues are a Non-GAAP measure calculated as revenues less directly related operations expenses attributable to the Company's principal services. We believe that net revenues are a better measure than are total revenues when analyzing and discussing our effectiveness in managing our principal services since total revenues earned as a freight consolidator include the carriers' charges to us for carrying the shipment, whereas revenues earned in other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees earned by us. Net revenue is one of our primary operational and financial measures and demonstrates our ability to concentrate and leverage purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings. Using net revenues also provides a commonality for comparison among various services. The following table presents the calculation of net revenues.
