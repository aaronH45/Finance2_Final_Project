  This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed by U.S. Bancorp (the "Company") to announce the designation of covered debt under certain of the Company’s replacement capital covenants, as required under the terms of those agreements.

Reference is hereby made to certain of the Company’s replacement capital covenants, as amended from time to time, executed: (i) June 10, 2010, relating to and in connection with the Company’s issuance of depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock; (ii) April 20, 2012, relating to and in connection with the Company’s issuance of depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of Series G Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock; and (iii) May 2, 2013, relating to and in connection with the Company’s issuance of depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of Series H Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (together, as amended, the "Replacement Capital Covenants"). Additional information with respect to the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenants is summarized in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2014.

The Replacement Capital Covenants and related amendments are filed as exhibits hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
