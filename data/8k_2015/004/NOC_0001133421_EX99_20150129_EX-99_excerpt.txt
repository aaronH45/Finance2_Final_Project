•2015 EPS Guidance of $9.20 to $9.50 

FALLS CHURCH, Va. – Jan. 29, 2015 – Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported fourth quarter 2014 net earnings of $506 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, compared to $478 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 diluted earnings per share increased 17 percent and are based on 204.2 million weighted average shares outstanding compared with 225.2 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2013, a decrease of 9 percent. The company repurchased 4.5 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2014 for $599 million. As a result of the passage of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, which extended tax benefits that expired on Dec. 31, 2013, the company recognized a full year research and development tax credit of $38 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

For 2014, net earnings totaled $2.1 billion, or $9.75 per diluted share, compared to $2.0 billion, or $8.35 per diluted share in 2013. Diluted earnings per share for 2014 increased 17 percent and are based on 212.1 million weighted average shares outstanding compared with 233.9 million shares in 2013. During 2014, the company repurchased 21.4 million shares of its common stock for $2.7 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2014, the company had repurchased 42.2 million shares toward its previously announced goal of retiring 60 million shares of its common stock by the end of 2015, market conditions permitting.

“Our team delivered another year of strong performance in 2014. We are excited about our many future opportunities and remain committed to generating value through sustainable performance, a well-aligned portfolio and effective cash deployment,” said Wes Bush, chairman, chief executive officer and president.

Non-GAAP metric — see definitions at the end of this press release.

Fourth quarter 2014 total operating income and operating margin rate were comparable to the prior year period. Fourth quarter operating income includes lower segment operating income and higher unallocated corporate expense, partially offset by higher net FAS/CAS pension adjustment.

For 2014, operating income increased $73 million, or 2 percent, to $3.2 billion. Operating margin rate increased 60 basis points to 13.3 percent. The improvements in operating income and margin rate reflect a higher net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and higher segment operating income, partially offset by higher unallocated corporate expense. The net FAS/CAS adjustment increase includes a $259 million decrease in FAS expense, principally due to an increase in 2014 discount rate assumptions. In addition, CAS pension expense decreased $158 million, principally due to passage of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014, which includes provisions that resulted in a reduction in the amount of CAS pension expense charged to the company's contracts. 

Total backlog as of Dec. 31, 2014, was $38.2 billion compared with $37.0 billion as of Dec. 31, 2013. For 2014, new awards totaled $25.0 billion, and book-to-bill was 104 percent.

Fourth quarter 2014 federal and foreign income tax expense declined to $195 million from $229 million, and the company's effective tax rate declined to 27.8 percent from 32.4 percent in the prior year period. As a result of the passage of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, which extended tax benefits that expired on Dec. 31, 2013, the company recognized a 2014 research and development tax credit of $38 million, which reduced fourth quarter 2014 tax expense and effective tax rate from the prior year period. For 2014, federal and foreign income tax expense declined to $868 million from $911 million in 2013, and the company's effective tax rate declined to 29.6 percent from 31.8 percent in 2013. The company's lower effective tax rate in 2014 reflects a $51 million benefit for the partial resolution of its 2007-2009 Internal Revenue Service examination.

Aerospace Systems ($ millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Aerospace Systems fourth quarter 2014 sales increased 4 percent principally due to the timing of volume across a number of programs. For 2014, sales were comparable to 2013 and include $75 million realized for settlements of certain legal claims related to use of the company's intellectual property and a terminated program. Excluding the settlements, sales were slightly lower than 2013 due to lower volume for unmanned, space and military aircraft programs.

Aerospace Systems fourth quarter 2014 operating income increased 7 percent and operating margin rate increased 30 basis points to 11.8 percent. Higher operating income and margin rate for the quarter are principally due to higher sales volume and improved performance. For 2014, operating income increased 8 percent and operating margin rate increased 110 basis points to 13.2 percent. Higher operating income and margin rate are principally due to the $75 million realized for the settlements described above and to improved performance.

Electronic Systems ($ millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Electronic Systems fourth quarter and full year 2014 sales decreased 3 percent. Lower fourth quarter sales include lower volume for land and self protection programs, including infrared countermeasures and laser systems, and domestic intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting programs. These declines were partially offset by higher volume for international programs. For 2014, lower sales are principally due to lower volume for land and self-protection programs, including fewer deliveries of infrared countermeasures and laser systems; lower volume for domestic ISR and targeting programs, including fewer combat avionics deliveries; and lower volume for navigation and maritime programs. These declines were partially offset by higher volume for international programs.

Electronic Systems fourth quarter 2014 operating income decreased 6 percent, and operating margin rate decreased 60 basis points to 17.2 percent. Lower operating income and operating margin rate reflect lower sales and a lower level of net favorable adjustments than in the prior year period. For 2014, operating income decreased 6 percent, and operating margin rate decreased 60 basis points to 16.5 percent due to lower sales and a lower level of net favorable adjustments. In addition, 2013 operating income benefited from the reversal of a $26 million non-programmatic risk reserve.

Information Systems ($ millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Information Systems fourth quarter 2014 sales decreased 3 percent, principally due to lower volume for command and control programs as a result of reduced funding levels and in-theater force reductions. These declines were partially offset by higher volume for ISR and cyber programs. For 2014, sales decreased 6 percent, principally due to lower volume for command and control programs and communications programs due to in-theater force reductions, reduced funding levels and the wind-down of various programs.

Information Systems fourth quarter 2014 operating income decreased 8 percent and operating margin rate declined to 9.3 percent. Lower fourth quarter operating income and margin rate reflect lower sales and increased investments in international business. For 2014, operating income decreased 3 percent, and operating margin rate increased 20 basis points to 9.8 percent. Lower operating income reflects lower sales and the increase in operating margin rate is due to improved performance.

Technical Services ($ millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Technical Services fourth quarter 2014 sales decreased 2 percent principally due to lower volume for integrated logistics and modernization programs, including Hunter and ICBM, and the Combined Tactical Training Range (CTTR) program. Declines in these programs were partially offset by higher international sales. For 2014, sales decreased 2 percent principally due to lower volume for the ICBM, Hunter and CTTR programs, partially offset by higher international sales, principally due to the acquisition of Qantas Defence Services in the first quarter of 2014.

Technical Services fourth quarter and full year 2014 operating income and operating margin rate were comparable to the prior year periods.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Disclosure: Today’s press release contains non-GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) financial measures, as defined by SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) Regulation G and indicated by a footnote in the text of the release. While the company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating our financial information, they should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Definitions are provided for the non-GAAP measures and reconciliations are provided in the body of the release.

Free cash flow: Cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and the payment of dividends.

This measure should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities before discretionary pension contributions is reconciled in Table 2.
