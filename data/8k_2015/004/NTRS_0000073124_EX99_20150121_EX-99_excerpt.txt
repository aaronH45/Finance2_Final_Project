NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME  

OF $244.0 MILLION, EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF $0.98  

FULL YEAR NET INCOME  

OF $811.8 MILLION, EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF $3.32  

(Chicago, January 21, 2015) Northern Trust Corporation today reported fourth quarter net income per diluted common share of $0.98, up from $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $0.84 in the third quarter of 2014. Net income was $244.0 million, compared to $169.7 million in the prior year quarter and $204.5 million in the prior quarter. Return on average common equity was 11.5%, compared to 8.7% in the prior year quarter and 10.1% in the prior quarter.  

The current quarter includes a $9.5 million income tax benefit related to Northern Trust’s decision to reinvest the pre-tax earnings of a foreign subsidiary indefinitely outside the U.S. Excluding the income tax benefit, net income per diluted common share, net income and return on average common equity in the current quarter were $0.94, $234.5 million and 11.0%. The prior year quarter included a $19.2 million pre-tax charge in connection with an agreement to resolve certain litigation. Excluding the legal settlement charge, net income per diluted common share, net income and return on average common equity in the prior year quarter were $0.75, $181.6 million, and 9.3%, respectively.  

Net income per diluted common share for the full year was $3.32, compared to $2.99 in 2013. Net income for 2014 totaled $811.8 million, up $80.5 million, or 11%, from the prior year’s $731.3 million.  

“Fourth quarter and full year results reflect a continued focus on serving the complex and evolving needs of our clients, while enhancing profitability and returns for our shareholders. Our return on equity improved to 10.0% in 2014 from 9.5% in 2013. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.33 per share and repurchased 7.5 million shares during the year, returning $792 million in capital to our common shareholders compared to $609 million in 2013.  

New business and higher equity markets drove client assets under custody and under management up 7% and 6%, respectively, in 2014. Trust, investment and other servicing fees – which represent 65% of total revenue – increased a strong 9%. Expense growth of 5% reflects continued growth in our business, ongoing investment to support technology initiatives, and actions taken during 2014 to realign our organizational structure,” said Frederick H. Waddell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  

FOURTH QUARTER 2014 PERFORMANCE VS. FOURTH QUARTER 2013  

Net income per common share was $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2014, up from $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Net income was $244.0 million, compared to $169.7 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the current quarter income tax benefit, net income per diluted common share and net income were $0.94 and $234.5 million. Excluding the prior year quarter legal settlement charge, net income per diluted common share and net income in the prior year quarter were $0.75 and $181.6 million, respectively.  

Revenue of $1.13 billion was up $84.9 million, or 8%, from $1.05 billion in the prior year quarter. Noninterest income increased $70.9 million, or 9%, to $866.2 million from the prior year quarter’s $795.3 million, primarily reflecting higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, foreign exchange trading income and security commissions and trading income as compared to the prior year quarter. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis increased $11.8 million, or 5%, to $270.9 million compared to $259.1 million in the prior year quarter, due to higher levels of earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin.  

Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $728.2 million, up $54.4 million, or 8%, from $673.8 million in the prior year quarter. The increase primarily reflects new business and higher equity markets, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.

FOURTH QUARTER 2014 PERFORMANCE VS. FOURTH QUARTER 2013 (continued)  

Assets under custody and assets under management are the primary drivers of our trust, investment and other servicing fees. The following table provides the assets under custody and assets under management of Northern Trust’s Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management business units.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees increased $38.4 million, or 10%, to $409.5 million from the prior year quarter’s $371.1 million.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, increased 12%, driven by new business and higher equity markets, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. C&IS investment management fees increased 4%, as higher equity markets and new business were partially offset by higher waived fees in money market mutual funds. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in C&IS, attributable to persistent low short-term interest rates, totaled $16.8 million, compared to waived fees of $14.7 million in the prior year quarter. Securities lending revenue was unchanged from the prior year quarter, as higher loan volumes were offset by lower spreads in the current quarter. Other fees in C&IS increased 23%, primarily related to income from investment risk and analytical services.

FOURTH QUARTER 2014 PERFORMANCE VS. FOURTH QUARTER 2013 (continued)  

Trust, investment and other servicing fees in Wealth Management totaled $318.7 million, increasing $16.0 million, or 5%, from $302.7 million in the prior year quarter. The increased fees are attributable to higher equity markets and new business.

Foreign exchange trading income totaled $60.7 million, up $9.9 million, or 19%, compared with $50.8 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is attributable to higher currency market volatility and client volumes as compared to the prior year quarter.  

Security commissions and trading income totaled $20.9 million compared to $14.6 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of $6.3 million, or 43%. The increase is attributable to higher income from interest rate protection products as well as higher core brokerage revenues.  

Other operating income totaled $41.2 million, up 8% from $38.2 million in the prior year quarter. The increase reflects additional income associated with a third-party servicing agreement modified in the current quarter.  

Net interest income on an FTE basis totaled $270.9 million, up $11.8 million, or 5%, compared to $259.1 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is the result of higher levels of earning assets, partially offset by a decline in the net interest margin. Earning assets for the quarter averaged $99.4 billion, up $7.8 billion, or 9%, from $91.6 billion in the prior year quarter, primarily resulting from higher levels of Federal Reserve deposits, securities and loans, reflecting higher levels of demand and interest-bearing deposits. The net interest margin declined to 1.08% from 1.12% in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting lower yields on earning assets, partially offset by a lower cost of interest-related funds.  

A provision for credit losses of $3.0 million was recorded in the current quarter compared to $5.0 million in the prior year quarter. Net charge-offs were $5.4 million, resulting from charge-offs of $8.2 million and recoveries of $2.8 million. The prior year quarter included $14.6 million of net charge-offs, resulting from $19.5 million of charge-offs and $4.9 million of

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Excluding the prior year quarter legal settlement charge of $19.2 million, noninterest expense increased $6.0 million, or 1%, from the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to higher compensation and equipment and software expense, partially offset by lower outside services expense.  

Compensation expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, equaled $355.7 million, up $20.9 million, or 6%, from $334.8 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting higher performance-based compensation, staff growth and base pay adjustments, partially offset by the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis at December 31, 2014, totaled approximately 15,400, up 4% from a year ago.

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED NET INTEREST INCOME TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT  

Net interest income stated on an FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. The tables below present a reconciliation of interest income and net interest income prepared in accordance with GAAP to interest income and net interest income on an FTE basis.
