Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On January 15, 2015, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Dollar Tree, Inc. (the “Company”) adopted and approved amendments to the Company’s bylaws. Among other things, the amendments implement a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections. Consequently, a director nominee will be elected by a majority of votes cast in uncontested director elections. In contested elections, the plurality voting standard continues to apply. The amendments also clarify the duties and powers of the president and chief executive officer of the Company, and other immaterial revisions.

The foregoing description of the Company’s bylaws, as amended and restated by the Board, is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such amended and restated bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
