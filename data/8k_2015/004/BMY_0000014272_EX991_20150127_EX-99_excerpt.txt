(NEW YORK, January 27, 2015) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014, which were highlighted by strong global sales for priority brands and important advances in the company’s immuno-oncology (I-O) portfolio. The company received accelerated regulatory approval of Opdivo in the U.S., presented encouraging clinical data for Opdivo across several tumor types from its broad clinical program, and announced positive results that led to the early stop of Opdivo’s Phase 3 trial in squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, the company presented important clinical data for Eliquis and daclatasvir and provided financial guidance for 2015. 

“We had an excellent fourth quarter to close a strong year financially and operationally, and made significant progress in our I-O pipeline with the approval of Opdivo in the U.S. for patients with advanced melanoma,” said Lamberto Andreotti, chief executive officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “Our performance in 2014 across brands and geographies, continued innovation and productivity in R&D and investments in business development opportunities reflect the strength and execution of our BioPharma strategy, and positions us well for 2015,” Andreotti said.

FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS 

•Bristol-Myers Squibb posted fourth quarter 2014 revenues of $4.3 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to the same period a year ago. Excluding the divested Diabetes Alliance, global revenues increased 6% or 9% adjusted for foreign exchange impact.

•U.S. revenues decreased 8% to $2.1 billion in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. International revenues were flat. 

•Gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 77.3% in the quarter compared to 71.3% in the same period a year ago. The increase is primarily attributable to the diabetes divestiture. 

•Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 8% to $1.2 billion in the quarter.

•Advertising and product promotion spending decreased 16% to $213 million in the quarter.

•Research and development expenses increased 24% to $1.2 billion in the quarter, primarily due to timing. 

•The effective tax rate was 145% in the quarter, compared to 15.4% in the fourth quarter last year. Income taxes in the current quarter include net tax benefits attributed to specified items and the R&D credit for the full year 2014.

•The company reported net earnings attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb of $13 million, or $0.01 per share, in the quarter compared to $726 million, or $0.44 per share, a year ago. The results in the quarter include an after-tax $0.28 per share impact of a non-cash charge resulting from the transfer of $1.5 billion of U.S. pension obligations to Prudential.

•The company reported non-GAAP net earnings attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb of $771 million, or $0.46 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to $842 million, or $0.51 per share, for the same period in 2013. An overview of specified items, including the pension-related charge mentioned above, is discussed under the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” section. 

•Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.8 billion, with a net cash position of $4.0 billion, as of December 31, 2014.

FOURTH QUARTER PRODUCT AND PIPELINE UPDATE

Bristol-Myers Squibb’s global sales in the fourth quarter included Eliquis, which grew by $210 million, Yervoy, which grew 41%, Orencia, which grew 12%, Sprycel, which grew 9%, and Daklinza and Sunvepra, which had combined sales of $207 million.

Opdivo

•In January, the company announced that an open-label, randomized Phase 3 study evaluating Opdivo, a human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody, versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with advanced, squamous cell NSCLC was stopped early because an assessment conducted by the independent Data Monitoring Committee concluded that the study met its endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival in patients receiving Opdivo compared to the control arm. The company will share these data - which for the first time indicate a survival advantage with an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor in lung cancer - with health authorities.

The one-year survival rate was 73% for Opdivo vs. 42% for dacarbazine and there was a 58% decrease in the risk of death for patients treated with Opdivo (hazard ratio for death: 0.42, P<0.0001). This survival advantage was also observed in Opdivo-treated patients who are positive or negative for programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). The findings were published in NEJM.

•In October, at the Chicago Multidisciplinary Symposium on Thoracic Oncology, the company announced results from CheckMate -063, a Phase 2 single-arm, open-label study of Opdivo administered as a single agent in patients with advanced squamous cell NSCLC who have progressed after at least two prior systemic treatments. Sixty-five percent of patients studied (n=117) received three or more prior therapies. With approximately 11 months of minimum follow-up, the objective response rate - the study’s primary endpoint - was 15% (95% CI = 8.7, 22.2) as assessed by an independent review committee using RECIST 1.1 criteria and the median duration of response was not reached. The estimated one-year survival rate was 41% (95% CI = 31.6, 49.7) and median overall survival was 8.2 months (95% CI = 6.05, 10.91). 

Eliquis[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•In November, the company and its partner, Pfizer, along with Portola Pharmaceuticals announced results from the first part of the Phase 3 ANNEXA™-A studies for Andexanet alfa, Portola’s investigational anti-Factor Xa agent to reverse the anticoagulant effect of Eliquis. Andexanet alfa produced rapid and nearly complete reversal (approximately 94%, P<0.0001) of the anticoagulant effect of Eliquis in healthy volunteers ages 50-75. The data were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in Chicago.

Daclatasvir

•In November, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter regarding the New Drug Application (NDA) for daclatasvir, an NS5A complex inhibitor, in combination with other agents for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV). The initial daclatasvir NDA focused on its use in combination with asunaprevir, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor. 

4

Given the withdrawal of asunaprevir in the U.S. by Bristol-Myers Squibb in October, the FDA is requesting additional data about daclatasvir in combination with other antiviral agents for the treatment of HCV. Daclatasvir is marketed as Daklinza in Japan and the European Union.

•In November, the company announced results from the landmark ALLY trial investigating a ribavirin-free 12-week regimen of daclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir in genotype 3 HCV patients, a patient population that has emerged as one of the most difficult to treat. The data, which showed sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) in 90% of treatment-naïve and 86% of treatment-experienced patients, were presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) in Boston.

•In November, also at AASLD, the company announced data from the UNITY trial program investigating a 12-week regimen of its all-oral daclatasvir-based TRIO regimen - a fixed-dose combination of daclatasvir with asunaprevir and beclabuvir - in a broad range of patients with genotype 1 HCV. In the UNITY-2 study, which evaluated cirrhotic patients, 98% of treatment-naïve and 93% of treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients receiving TRIO with ribavirin achieved SVR12 and 93% of treatment-naïve and 87% of treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients receiving TRIO without ribavirin achieved SVR12. In the open-label UNITY-1 study, which evaluated the TRIO regimen without ribavirin in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced non-cirrhotic patients for 12 weeks with 24 weeks of follow-up, 91% of patients achieved SVR12 and 92% of treatment-naive patients and 89% of treatment-experienced patients achieved cure without the use of ribavirin. 

Orencia

•In November, at the American College of Rheumatology annual meeting in Boston, the company announced results from several new sub-analyses of the Phase 3b AVERT trial investigating the use of Orencia plus methotrexate (MTX) in biologic and methotrexate-naïve citrullinated protein (CCP)-positive early moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The subanalyses showed that first-line treatment with Orencia plus MTX resulted in patients with early RA achieving significantly higher rates of stringent measures of remission; reduced the development of anti-CCP antibodies, an indicator of more severe, persistent, and erosive disease in patients with early rapidly progressing RA; improved synovitis and osteitis scores at 12 months; and improved joint erosion scores at both 12 and 18 months, compared to MTX alone.

FOURTH QUARTER BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT UPDATE[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•In January, the company announced a clinical trial collaboration with Lilly to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of Opdivo in combination with Lilly’s galunisertib (LY2157299), a TGF beta R1 kinase inhibitor. The Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the investigational combination of Opdivo and galunisertib as a potential treatment option for patients with advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and NSCLC.

•In January, the company announced a worldwide research collaboration with the California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr) to develop novel small molecule anti-fibrotic therapies, and an exclusive license agreement that allows Bristol-Myers Squibb to develop, manufacture and commercialize Calibr’s preclinical compounds resulting from the collaboration.

•In December, the company and its partner, Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., along with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., announced a clinical trial collaboration agreement to conduct a Phase 1 combination study of Opdivo and mogamulizumab, an anti-CCR4 antibody. The study, which will be conducted in Japan, will focus on evaluating the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of combining Opdivo and mogamulizumab as a potential treatment option for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. 

•In November, the company and Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc., announced that they have entered into an exclusive clinical collaboration agreement to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of combining Opdivo with FPA008, Five Prime’s monoclonal antibody that inhibits the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor. The Phase 1a/1b study will evaluate the combination of Opdivo and FPA008 as a potential treatment option for patients with NSCLC, melanoma, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and malignant glioma.

•In November, the company announced plans to construct a state-of-the-art, large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Cruiserath, County Dublin, Ireland. The facility will produce multiple therapies for the company’s growing biologics portfolio and significantly increase Bristol-Myers Squibb’s biologics manufacturing capacity.

•In November, the company and Galecto Biotech AB announced that the companies, together with Galecto’s shareholders, have entered into an agreement that provides Bristol-Myers Squibb the exclusive option to acquire Galecto Biotech AB and gain worldwide rights to its lead asset TD139, a novel inhaled inhibitor of galectin-3 in Phase 1 development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other pulmonary fibrotic conditions.

•In October, the company and Lonza announced a multi-year expansion of their existing biologics manufacturing agreement. Lonza will produce commercial quantities of a second Bristol-Myers Squibb biologic medicine at its mammalian manufacturing facility in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

•In October, the company and F-star Alpha Ltd. announced that the companies, together with F-star Alpha’s shareholders, have entered into an agreement that provides Bristol-Myers Squibb the exclusive option to acquire F-star Alpha, and gain worldwide rights to its lead asset, FS102. FS102 is a novel, Phase 1-ready human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy in development for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer among a well-defined population of HER2-positive patients who do not respond or become resistant to current therapies.
