 Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition   

 Attached and being furnished hereby as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of a press release of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. ("IFF" or the "Company") dated February 12, 2015 reporting IFF's financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.  

 An audio webcast to discuss the Company's fourth quarter 2014 financial results and full year 2015 outlook will be held today, February 12, 2015, at 10:00 a.m. EST. Interested parties can access the webcast and accompanying slide presentation on the Company's website at www.iff.com under the Investor Relations section. For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available on the Company's website approximately one hour after the event and will remain available on the IFF website for one year.  

 Non-GAAP financial measures: In the attached press release and the referenced audio webcast, the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial operating measures: (i) adjusted earnings per share, (ii) adjusted gross margin, (iii) adjusted operating profit, (iv) adjusted operating profit margin, (v) adjusted cash flow from operations, and (vi) local currency sales. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing the Company’s historical and expected future results and financial condition, the Company believes it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company believes such additional non-GAAP information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period-to-period performance of our business. In addition, management internally reviews each of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to our business. A material limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. The Company compensates for such limitations by presenting the reconciliations contained in the attached press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
