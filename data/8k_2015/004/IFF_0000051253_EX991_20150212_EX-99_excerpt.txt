 Fourth Quarter Local Currency Sales Grew 7%; Adjusted Diluted EPS Increased 17% to $1.07  

 Full Year Local Currency Sales Grew 5%; Adjusted Diluted EPS Increased 14% to $5.08  

 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 12, 2015--International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF), a leading global creator of flavors and fragrances for consumer products, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended January 2, 2015.  

 Fourth Quarter 2014 Results   

 Reported sales increased $30.9 million, or 4%, to $756.1 million from $725.2 million in the prior year quarter. Local currency sales increased 7% reflecting strong growth across both businesses and an additional week of sales activity in 2014.  

 Adjusted operating profit increased $20.6 million, or 18%, to $132.6 million from $112.0 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 17% to $1.07 from $0.92.  

 On a reported basis, operating profit rose $35.8 million, or 38%, to $130.6 million from $94.8 million in the prior year quarter. Reported diluted EPS rose 48% to $1.10 from $0.75.   

 Full Year 2014 Results   

 Reported and local currency sales in 2014 both increased 5% to $3.1 billion driven by solid new win performance and the acquisition of Aromor during the first quarter of 2014. The emerging markets, which grew three times faster than the developed markets on a local currency basis, now account for approximately 50% of total sales.  

 Adjusted operating profit grew $60.8 million, or 11%, to $601.3 million from $540.4 million in 2013, and adjusted diluted EPS gained 14% to $5.08 from $4.46.  

 On a U.S. GAAP basis, operating profit rose $76.0 million, or 15%, to $592.3 million from $516.3 million in 2013. GAAP diluted EPS increased 18% to $5.06 versus $4.29.   

 Schedules at the end of this release contain reconciliations of reported GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics.  

 Management Commentary  

 “We are pleased to report that IFF achieved its long-term financial targets for 2014. We met or exceeded our revenue, operating profit and EPS goals and, at the same time, continued to invest in R&D, manufacturing and commercial resources to strengthen our business longer-term,” said Andreas Fibig, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “In addition to our strong results, 2014 marked great strides in sustainability, with our inclusion in the CDP Climate Disclosure Leadership Index. We also successfully integrated Aromor into our Fragrances business, which contributed to our overall results. And of course, we celebrated our 125th year anniversary, a tremendous achievement, which was exemplified by our people and their passion, creativity, expertise and empowerment.”  

 Fourth Quarter 2014 Operating Highlights   

 Local currency sales increased 7%, led by high-single digit growth in Latin America, North America and EAME. Growth this quarter benefitted by approximately 2 percentage points associated with an additional week of sales, or 53rd week, which generally occurs every six years and 1 percentage point from the acquisition of Aromor.  

 Adjusted gross profit margin declined slightly to 43.6% from 43.8% in the prior year quarter principally driven by unfavorable net impact of price to input costs.  

 Research, selling and administrative (RSA) expenses, as a percent of sales, was 26.1% versus 28.3% in the year-ago period, as continued investments in R&D and commercial opportunities were more than offset by lower incentive compensation expense.  

 Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted operating profit increased 18%, or $20.6 million, to $132.6 million from $112.0 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 210 basis points to 17.5% from 15.4% driven by lower RSA costs.  

 Adjusted EPS grew 17%, to $1.07, as year-over-year gains in adjusted operating profit were partially offset by a slightly higher adjusted effective tax rate and interest expense.   

 Fourth Quarter 2014 Segment Results  

 Fragrances Business Unit   

 Reported sales increased 5% to $399.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $382.2 million in the prior year quarter.  

 Local currency sales growth was 7%, including 2% of growth related to Aromor, acquired earlier in the year. All regions delivered solid mid-single growth.  

 Fine Fragrances local currency sales declined by 1%, against a very strong 13% growth reported in the year-ago period. A double-digit increase in Greater Asia was more than offset by weakness in EAME, which compared to a 32% growth rate reported in the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as softness in Latin America.  

 Consumer Fragrances delivered strong local currency sales growth of 8% led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care, Home Care and Hair Care.  

 Fragrance Ingredients local currency sales increased 13% driven by the Aromor acquisition announced earlier this year.  

 Fragrances segment profit increased 23%, or $14.1 million, to $76.2 million, up from $62.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Segment profit margin increased to 19.1%, up 290 basis points from 16.2% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in segment profit and segment profit margin reflects topline growth, lower incentive compensation expenses versus the strong prior year period, and productivity initiatives, which all combined to offset higher input costs.   

 Flavors Business Unit   

 Reported sales increased 4%, or $13.3 million, to $356.3 million from $343.0 million in the prior year quarter.  

 Local currency sales grew 6% in the fourth quarter, against a 7% year-ago comparison, led by 7% growth in the emerging markets and a strong performance in North America.  

 On a category basis, Beverages grew high double-digits with broad-based growth across all regions driven by strong innovative solutions for better-for-you products. Growth in Savory was also solid, improving mid-single digits globally, led by new win performance.  

 Flavors segment profit totaled $72.6 million, compared with $69.5 million in the prior year quarter. Flavors segment profit margin improved 10 basis points to 20.4% from 20.3% in the prior year quarter reflecting topline growth, productivity and cost control, and lower incentive compensation expense.   

 Full Year 2014 Operating Highlights   

 Reported sales increased 5%, or $136 million, to $3.1 billion in 2014 versus the prior year. Local currency sales also increased 5% reflecting 6% growth in emerging markets, 2% growth in the developed markets and the addition of Aromor.  

 Adjusted gross margin increased 60 basis points to 44.4% from 43.8% in 2013 driven by solid sales growth, and benefits from cost and productivity initiatives.  

 RSA expenses, as a percent of sales, declined 60 bps to 24.9% versus 25.5% in 2013 primarily related to lower incentive compensation expense.  

 Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted operating profit increased 11%, or $60.8 million, to $601.3 million from $540.4 million in 2013. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded by 120 basis points to 19.5% from 18.3% in the prior year as a result of gross margin expansion and lower RSA expense.  

 Adjusted diluted EPS improved 14% to $5.08 per share in 2014 reflecting sales growth, adjusted operating margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate, and a year-over-year decrease in average shares outstanding.  

 Cash flows from operations for the full year were $518.4 million, or 16.8% of sales, compared with $407.6 million, or 13.8% of sales, in the prior year, which included $48.0 million of cash payments related to the Spanish tax cases and incremental U.S. pension contributions. Excluding these payments from the Company’s 2013 operating cash flow, adjusted cash flow from operations would have increased 14% from $455.6 million in 2013 to $518.4 million in 2014 reflecting strong net income growth and improvements in working capital as a percentage of sales.  

 Cash returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in 2014 totaled $221.4 million, or 53%, of net income.   

 Full Year 2014 Segment Results  

 Fragrances Business Unit   

 Reported sales for the full year increased 7%, or $101.3 million, to $1.6 billion. Local currency sales also increased 7% as all regions and all categories within Fragrance Compounds posted solid growth.  

 For the full year, Fine Fragrances grew 2%, following an 8% local currency sales increase in 2013 as overall growth was supported by solid new wins across all regions.  

 Consumer Fragrances increased 5% in 2014 led by Fabric Care, which continues to benefit from industry-leading delivery system technology, as well as solid performances across all sub-categories, including Hair Care, Toiletries, Home Care and Personal Wash.  

 Fragrance Ingredients local currency sales grew 18%, including 15% growth associated with our Aromor acquisition.  

 Fragrances segment profit increased 18%, or $51.7 million, to $335.4 million, up from $283.7 million in 2013. The year-over-year improvement can be attributed to strong sales growth combined with gross margin expansion, ongoing cost discipline, and lower incentive compensation expense. The combined impact on segment profit margin was significant, improving 210 basis points year-over-year to 20.6%.   

 Flavors Business Unit   

 Reported sales for the full year increased 2%, or $34.3 million, to $1.5 billion.  

 Local currency sales increased 4% in 2014, as growth in Beverage, Dairy and Savory were driven by our innovation platform for better-for-you products.  

 On a regional basis, Latin America performed best, growing local currency sales double-digits every quarter in 2014 to finish the year with 16% growth. EAME and Greater Asia both delivered solid local currency growth, while North America, although improved in the second half, was challenged.  

 Full year Flavors segment profit totaled $331.3 million versus $323.6 million in the prior year, or an increase of 2%, as a result of lower incentive compensation and continued cost discipline. Flavors segment profit margin remained constant at 22.7%.   

 Management Commentary  

 Mr. Fibig continued, “As we look ahead to 2015, we believe our business is positioned for continued performance that generates favorable returns for our shareholders, despite some macro-economic uncertainty and increased currency pressure. We have a well-balanced geographic profile, a diverse product portfolio, and a strong innovation pipeline that we believe sets us apart from the competition. We believe this breadth and diversity provides our investors with an attractive combination of sustainable growth and strong cash flow generation. As such, our local currency sales and operating profit outlook for 2015 is consistent with our long-term targets, while we expect EPS growth in the high-single digits.”
