Item 8.01.Other Events.

On February 18, 2015, Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”) is hosting a live audio webcast of a presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference where PMI’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jacek Olczak, will address investors. PMI has issued a press release announcing the key highlights of the presentation. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Adjusted diluted EPS is not a U.S. GAAP measure. PMI defines adjusted diluted EPS as reported diluted EPS adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items. PMI believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings, improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends. Adjusted diluted EPS should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted EPS prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The information on PMI’s website referenced in the press release, including the presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, part of this Form 8-K or incorporated into any filing PMI makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission, except as expressly set forth in such a filing.
