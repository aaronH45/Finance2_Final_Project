We had solid results in Asia / Rest of World and China's sales met expectations although weakness in certain industrial end markets continues to limit its growth.

Outlook 

The Company updated its outlook for 2015 and noted that forecasting remains challenging due to continued uncertainty in demand in some markets and greater volatility in foreign exchange rates. Based on today’s assessment, management anticipates that local currency sales growth in 2015 will be in the range of 4% to 5% and Adjusted EPS in the range of $12.70 to $12.90, an increase of 8% to 10%. 

The Company said that based on its assessment of market conditions today, management anticipates local currency sales growth in the first quarter of 2015 will be in the range of 4% to 5%. This sales growth is expected to result in Adjusted EPS in the range of $2.13 to $2.18, an increase of 7% to 9%.

The Company also stated that the above guidance reflects the estimated impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates. Specifically, assuming foreign exchange rates remain constant at current levels, the Company estimates that Adjusted EPS growth is reduced by approximately 4% for the full year 2015 and by approximately 5% in the first quarter 2015 as compared to the foreign exchange rate environment that was in place last year. This reduction in earnings growth includes the impact of previously-disclosed Swiss Franc / Euro foreign currency forward contracts. 

Adjusted EPS excludes purchased intangible amortization, discrete tax items, restructuring charges and other one-time items. While the Company has provided an outlook for Adjusted EPS, it has not provided an outlook for EPS as it would require an estimate of non-recurring items, which are not yet known. 

Conclusion 

Filliol concluded, “We are pleased with the continued strong execution by our teams around the globe. Our Company is well positioned for continued market share gains as we leverage increased investment in front end resources and our strong product pipeline. We also remain focused on our margin enhancement initiatives and cash flow generation. While we remain cautious on the global economy, we believe we can generate above market growth in 2015 and beyond.”
