FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NextEra Energy reports 2014 fourth-quarter and full-year financial results

•NextEra Energy delivers strong fourth-quarter results and an excellent full year of growth

•Florida Power & Light Company continues to invest in the business to improve customer value proposition

•NextEra Energy Resources brought into service more than 1,600 megawatts of new contracted renewables

JUNO BEACH, Fla. - NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported 2014 fourth-quarter net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $884 million, or $2.00 per share, compared to $327 million, or $0.75 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2013. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy’s fourth-quarter earnings were $458 million, or $1.03 per share, compared to $414 million, or $0.95 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2013.

For the full year 2014, NextEra Energy reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $2.5 billion, or $5.60 per share, compared to $1.9 billion, or $4.47 per share, in 2013. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy’s 2014 earnings were $2.3 billion, or $5.30 per share, for the full year, compared to $2.1 billion, or $4.97 per share, in 2013.

Adjusted earnings for these periods exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges, as well as the net effect of other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments and operating results from the Spain solar project. Adjusted earnings for the full year also exclude the 2013 gain on the sale of the Maine hydropower assets, the 2013 loss and the 2014 gain associated with the Maine fossil assets, and the 2013 charges associated with an impairment on the Spain solar project. All of these items relate primarily to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities.

NextEra Energy’s management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the board of directors, and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company’s employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy’s management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy’s fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income attributable to NextEra Energy, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

“NextEra Energy delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding year overall,” said NextEra Energy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Robo. “At FPL, continued investment in the business and an expansion in wholesale operations drove full-year earnings growth.

Our highly efficient Riviera Beach modernization came into service ahead of schedule and contributed to reducing fuel costs for our customers. Our significant investment in new grid technologies showed clear reliability benefits for our customers. At Energy Resources, we attained our full-year financial expectations, while absorbing roughly $0.15 per share of a one-time impact from the launch of NextEra Energy Partners. At the same time, we had one of our best years ever in originating new investment opportunities and continue to build what we believe is the largest and best pipeline of new contracted renewables projects in North America. Stronger-than-expected demand for new renewables projects also highlights the long-term value of NextEra Energy’s incentive distribution fees through its sponsorship of NextEra Energy Partners. We also made good progress in moving forward with the development of the Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection pipelines, which will bring diversity of gas supply to our FPL customers and increase overall system reliability. Finally, our agreement to combine with Hawaiian Electric Industries reflects our strategy to grow earnings through regulated businesses and to leverage our position as North America’s leader in wind and solar generation.”

Florida Power & Light Company

NextEra Energy’s principal rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, reported fourth-quarter net income of $286 million, or $0.65 per share, compared to $248 million, or $0.57 per share, for the prior-year quarter. For the full year, net income was $1.52 billion, or $3.45 per share, compared to $1.35 billion, or $3.16 per share, in 2013. FPL’s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings per share increased approximately 14 percent and 9 percent, respectively, over the prior-year comparable periods. 

Driving FPL’s fourth-quarter and full-year growth were continued investments in clean, efficient generation and other infrastructure projects and an increase in wholesale power sales. FPL’s capital expenditures were approximately $832 million in the quarter, bringing full-year capital investments to approximately $3.1 billion. Regulatory capital employed in 2014 grew 5.8 percent, compared to the prior year.

FPL averaged approximately 68,000 more customers during the fourth quarter of 2014 than in the comparable prior-year quarter. The 12-month average of low-usage accounts fell to 8.2 percent, while the number of inactive accounts declined approximately 15 percent from the prior-year quarter. New meter connections continued to show steady improvement by increasing approximately 47,000 in 2014, which is more than 20 percent higher than the prior year. Underlying usage per customer in the fourth quarter declined by 5 percent year-over-year, largely due to unfavorable weather, but weather-normalized usage per customer grew slightly. 

These improved customer metrics are consistent with improving Florida economic indicators that the company tracks. The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in December 2014 was 5.6 percent, down 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier, even as the labor force participation rate increased, and Florida’s Consumer Sentiment Index reached its highest level since February 2007. In addition, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that Florida’s population increased by more than 290,000 people over the 12-month period that ended July 1, 2014, reaching 19.9 million and moving Florida ahead of New York as America’s third-largest state. 

Over the course of 2014, FPL continued to strengthen and deliver a customer value proposition that includes high reliability, award-winning customer service, a clean emissions profile and the lowest typical residential customer electric bill in Florida. FPL continued to execute on major capital projects, including bringing the Riviera Beach Clean Energy Center into service last April, ahead of schedule and under budget. In addition, the Port Everglades Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget, and is expected to come online in mid-2016. In total, since 2001, FPL’s investments in clean, fuel-efficient power plants have saved customers more than $7.5 billion in fuel costs and helped reduce the company’s use of foreign oil by 99 percent. These investments have also enabled FPL to significantly reduce power plant emissions rates and have prevented more than 85 million tons of carbon emissions to date. FPL now operates one of the most modern, clean, fuel-efficient and low-carbon generation fleets in the nation.

In addition, FPL’s operational excellence continues to support low customer bills, including typical residential customer electric bills that are approximately 25 percent lower than the national average. Beginning in 2015, FPL’s typical residential customer’s electric bill further decreased by nearly $2 per month.

In December 2014, the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) approved FPL’s request to begin investing in long-term natural gas supplies. FPL will partner in the development of gas-producing properties in the Woodford Shale region in southeastern Oklahoma. FPL expects this project will save money for customers over the long term and help to reduce variability in the fuel portion of the customer bill, which research shows is an important component of customer satisfaction. This investment represents a first, small step in what FPL expects could become a larger program that would further improve the value it delivers to its customers. FPL also requested that the PSC approve a set of guidelines for subsequent natural gas production projects that would allow the company and, in turn, its customers to take advantage of future beneficial natural gas investment opportunities. FPL expects a decision on the proposed guidelines in the first quarter of 2015. 

NextEra Energy Resources 

NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy, reported a fourth-quarter contribution to net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $614 million, or $1.39 per share, compared to $85 million, or $0.20 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources’ earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $178 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to $173 million, or $0.40 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, NextEra Energy Resources reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $985 million, or $2.24 per share, compared to $556 million, or $1.30 per share, in 2013. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources’ earnings were $833 million, or $1.89 per share, compared to $780 million, or $1.83 per share, for the full year 2013. Adjusted full-year results include a negative $0.15 per share impact associated with establishing and launching NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: NEP). This includes a $0.10 per share non-cash income tax charge, driven by separating the Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NextEra Energy Partners structure.

NextEra Energy Resources’ contribution to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter was flat from the comparable prior-year quarter. Strong growth from new contracted renewables projects and improvements in customer supply and trading were offset by reductions from gas infrastructure and from existing assets, with two of Energy Resources’ four nuclear units undertaking regular refueling outages. 

Primary growth drivers for NextEra Energy Resources for the full year were strong contributions from new wind and solar investments. Growth in the contracted renewables portfolio added $0.29 per share, reflecting new wind and solar investments placed into service, while existing assets added $0.06 per share. The customer supply and trading business added $0.04 per share year-over-year. Asset sales added $0.01 per share year-over-year. Costs associated with establishing and launching NextEra Energy Partners reduced results by $0.15 per share. Lower contributions from the gas infrastructure business decreased earnings by $0.06 per share year-over-year. All other factors reduced results by $0.13 per share, including $0.07 per share of dilution.

During the course of 2014, NextEra Energy Resources added 1,364 megawatts (MW) of wind and 265 MW of solar. 

Corporate and Other

In the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, Corporate and Other earnings decreased $0.02 per share, compared to the comparable prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, Corporate and Other earnings per share were flat, compared to the prior-year quarter. For the full year 2014, Corporate and Other earnings decreased $0.10 per share on a GAAP basis, compared to 2013. On an adjusted basis, full-year 2014 Corporate and Other earnings decreased $0.02 per share year-over-year.

The Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection natural gas pipeline projects continue to progress well through the development process. In 2014, both projects filed their certification applications with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The company continues to expect FERC decisions in 2015, which would allow construction of the proposed interstate pipeline system to begin in 2016 and operations to commence in mid-2017.

The Mountain Valley Pipeline joint venture with EQT Corporation continues to progress through the permitting process. The joint venture completed a binding open season for the approximately 300-mile Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline project, which is designed to connect the Marcellus and Utica natural gas supply to markets in the U.S. Southeast to support growing demand and to improve reliability. The project is expected to be operational by year-end 2018.

Outlook 

NextEra Energy continues to expect full-year 2015 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.70. NextEra Energy now expects 2016 full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.75 to $6.25. 

NextEra Energy’s adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges, as well as net OTTI losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources’ nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time, and operating results from the Spain solar project. In addition, adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; continued recovery of the national and the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; current forward curves; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no divestitures, other than to NextEra Energy Partners, LP, or acquisitions; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental tax policy or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.
