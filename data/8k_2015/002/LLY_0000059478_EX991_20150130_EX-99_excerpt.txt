Lilly Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2014 Results, Updates 2015 Guidance

•Fourth-quarter 2014 revenue declined 12 percent driven by the impact of U.S. patent expirations for Cymbalta and Evista and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by strong volume growth in several other products.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Approximately $2.9 billion in cash was returned to shareholders in 2014 through dividends and share repurchases.

•2015 EPS guidance is confirmed in the range of $2.40 to $2.50 (reported), or $3.10 to $3.20 (non-GAAP); revenue and other elements of guidance have been revised as a result of recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared with several other currencies.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Certain financial information for 2014 and 2013 is presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Some numbers in this press release may not add due to rounding. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Non-GAAP measures exclude the items described in the reconciliation tables later in the release. The non-GAAP measures are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company’s business. The company’s 2015 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. 

"While Lilly’s fourth-quarter 2014 results continue to reflect the impact of patent expirations, we are moving to a period of growth led by diabetes, oncology and animal health," said John C. Lechleiter, Ph.D., Lilly’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Despite the loss of significant revenue for Cymbalta and Evista following the expiration of our U.S. patents, we saw strong performance from many other products. At the same time, we made excellent progress with our innovation-based strategy, and we continue to advance our pipeline. Throughout the balance of this decade, we aim to drive revenue growth and expand margins as we offer new medicines to the people who need them."

Fourth-Quarter Reported Results

In the fourth quarter of 2014, worldwide total revenue was $5.121 billion, a decrease of 12 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. The revenue decline was comprised of 9 percent due to lower volume and 4 percent due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset 1 percent due to higher prices. The 9 percent decrease in worldwide volume was driven by the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Cymbalta® in December 2013 and Evista® in March 2014, partially offset by volume gains for several other products. Total revenue in the U.S. decreased 19 percent to $2.453 billion, driven by lower demand for Cymbalta and Evista following patent expirations as well as wholesaler buying patterns. Total revenue outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent to $2.669 billion, primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher volume, including the impact of products acquired from Lohmann Animal Health.

Gross margin decreased 13 percent to $3.868 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by lower sales of Cymbalta and Evista due to the loss of U.S. patent protection. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 75.5 percent, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease in gross margin percent was primarily 

 4

due to lower sales of Cymbalta and Evista following U.S. patent expirations, largely offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.

Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014, defined as the sum of research and development, and marketing, selling and administrative expenses, were $2.986 billion, a decrease of 13 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. Research and development expenses decreased 20 percent to $1.186 billion, or 23.2 percent of total revenue, driven primarily by lower late-stage clinical development costs in the fourth quarter of 2014. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 8 percent to $1.800 billion, due primarily to a reduction in sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta, as well as ongoing cost containment efforts.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development charges of $105.2 million. These charges were comprised of $55.2 million associated with revisions to the agreement between Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim, and $50.0 million related to the collaboration with Adocia. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development charges of $57.1 million related to the acquisition of all development and commercial rights from Arteaus Therapeutics for a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody being studied for the prevention of frequent, recurrent migraine headaches.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $401.0 million, comprised of $189.7 million for asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico, $188.9 million associated with severance costs related to ongoing cost containment efforts to reduce the company's cost structure and global workforce, and $22.4 million associated with integration costs for the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $35.4 million, primarily related to charges associated with restructuring to reduce the company's cost structure and global workforce.

 5

Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $376.4 million, a decrease of 58 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, driven primarily by lower gross margin and higher asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges, partially offset by lower operating expenses.

Other income (expense) was income of $137.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with income of $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. This difference was driven primarily by $92.0 million of other income in 2014 associated with revisions to the agreement between Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim, and net gains on investments.

The effective tax rate was 16.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with 20.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 includes the benefit of the full-year renewal of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. at the end of 2014, partially offset by the tax impact of asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges. 

In the fourth quarter of 2014, net income decreased 41 percent to $428.5 million and earnings per share decreased 40 percent to $0.40, compared with fourth quarter 2013 net income of $727.5 million and earnings per share of $0.67. The decreases in net income and earnings per share were driven by lower operating income, partially offset by increased other income and a lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2014. Earnings per share benefited slightly from a lower number of shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.

Fourth-Quarter 2014 Non-GAAP Measures

On a non-GAAP basis, fourth-quarter 2014 operating income decreased $110.7 million, or 11 percent, to $882.6 million, driven by lower gross margin, partially offset by lower operating expenses. The effective tax rate decreased to 14.0 percent, compared with 20.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 includes the full-year benefit of the renewal of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. at the end of 2014. Reflecting the benefit of the lower tax rate in the 

 6

fourth quarter, net income remained flat at $797.6 million and earnings per share increased 1 percent to $0.75, compared with $796.9 million and $0.74, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2013.

The company still expects full-year 2015 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.50 on a reported basis. On a non-GAAP basis, full year 2015 earnings per share are still expected to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Amortization and inventory step-up costs associated with the Novartis Animal Health acquisition are subject to final acquisition accounting adjustments. Numbers do not add due to rounding.

The company now anticipates 2015 revenue of between $19.5 billion and $20.0 billion. The acquisition of Novartis Animal Health is expected to add significant revenue. 

The company now anticipates that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 75.0 percent in 2015 on a reported basis and 78.0 percent on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting the exclusion of inventory step-up costs associated with the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health as well as amortization of intangibles. 

On a reported basis, marketing, selling and administrative expenses are now expected to be in the range of $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, marketing, selling and administrative expenses are now expected to be in the range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion, reflecting the exclusion of amortization of intangibles. Research and development expenses are now expected to be in the range 

 17

of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion reflecting an expected increase in Phase III trial expenses and the inclusion of Novartis Animal Health.

Other income (expense) is still expected to be in a range between $75 million and $125 million of income in 2015 on a reported and non-GAAP basis.

The 2015 tax rate is still expected to be approximately 18.5 percent on a reported basis and 21.5 percent on a non-GAAP basis, assuming a full-year 2015 benefit of the R&D tax credit and other tax provisions up for extension. If these items are not extended, the 2015 tax rate would be approximately 1.5 percentage points higher. The 2015 expected reported tax rate includes the tax impact of costs associated with the Novartis Animal Health and Lohmann Animal Health acquisitions and amortization of intangibles.

Capital expenditures are still expected to be approximately $1.3 billion.

The company's 2015 financial guidance does not include a potential charge related to the collaboration with Pfizer to develop and commercialize tanezumab, an NGF monoclonal antibody being studied for the treatment of pain. As previously communicated, if the partial clinical hold for the molecule is removed and Lilly and Pfizer move forward with development, Lilly will pay a $200 million upfront fee to Pfizer. This charge would cause Lilly's reported tax rate to be roughly 1 percentage point lower and would reduce reported EPS by approximately $0.12.

The following table summarizes the company’s 2015 financial guidance.

(a)The company uses non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial statements reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The items that are excluded when non-GAAP measures or expectations provided are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on the company’s reported operations for a period. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate the company’s ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(b)Operating expenses include research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses.

(c)Certain GAAP reported measures have been adjusted to eliminate acquired in-process research and development expenses. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, amounts totaling $105.2 million (pretax), or $0.06 per share (after-tax), of expense were eliminated associated with revisions to the agreement between Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim, and the acquired in-process research and development charge for the collaboration agreement with Adocia. During the three months ended December 31, 2013, amounts totaling $57.1 million (pretax), or $0.03 per share (after-tax), of expense were eliminated related to the acquired in-process research and development for the CGRP antibody.

(d)Certain GAAP reported measures have been adjusted to eliminate asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, amounts totaling $401.0 million (pretax), or $0.34 per share (after-tax), of expense were eliminated related to asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico, severance costs related to ongoing cost containment efforts to reduce the Company's cost structure and global workforce, and integration costs for the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health. During the three months ended December 31, 2013, amounts totaling $35.4 million (pretax), or $0.03 per share (after-tax), of expense were eliminated primarily related to costs associated with restructuring to reduce the Company's cost structure and global workforce.

(e)Certain GAAP reported measures have been adjusted to eliminate a portion of other income (expense). During the three months ended December 31, 2014, amounts totaling $92.0 million (pretax), or $0.06 per share (after-tax), of income were eliminated associated with revisions to the agreement between Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim.
