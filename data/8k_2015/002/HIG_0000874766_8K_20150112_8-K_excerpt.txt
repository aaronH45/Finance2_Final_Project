Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure

On January12, 2015, the Company made available to investors selected quarterly financial information for each of the quarters in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013 to illustrate the impact on the Company’s financial results and certain financial measures of (1) refining the definition of underwriting expenses by including certain centralized services and bad debt expenses in the determination of underwriting results and (2) realigning certain lines of business between Middle Market and Specialty Commercial within the Commercial Lines reporting segment (formerly P&C Commercial) to reflect the Company's management reporting structure. Underwriting results for programs and livestock business are now reported in Middle Market instead of Specialty Commercial and underwriting results for fidelity and surety business are now reported in Specialty Commercial instead of Middle Market. The reclassification of certain centralized services and bad debt expenses from other income (expense) did not impact previously reported Property & Casualty Combined net income or core earnings. Separately, the Consumer Markets reporting segment has been renamed "Personal Lines". The Company is making this information available to provide investors an opportunity to become familiar with the impact of these changes prior to the Company’s earnings release for the quarterly period ending December 31, 2014. A copy of the revised IFS is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith.
