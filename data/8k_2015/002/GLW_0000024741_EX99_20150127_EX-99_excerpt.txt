Company achieves $10 billion* in core sales milestone; 

Annual core EPS grows 24% 

CORNING, N.Y. — Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. 

Fourth-Quarter Highlights 

  ·    Core earnings per share were $0.45*, a 55% increase over last year’s fourth quarter. These results were better than anticipated and completed the company’s ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year core earnings growth. GAAP earnings per share were $0.70.    

  ·    Core sales were $2.6 billion*, a 30% increase from the comparable period last year. GAAP sales were $2.4 billion.    

  ·    In the Display Technologies segment, LCD glass volume remained strong as retail demand for large screen TVs continued.    

  ·    All of Corning’s business segments delivered year-over-year quarterly sales gains.    

Full-Year Highlights 

  ·    Core sales were $10.2 billion*, a 29% increase from $7.9 billion last year, marking a record year in sales performance for the company. GAAP sales were $9.7 billion.    

  ·    Core earnings per share were $1.53*, a 24% year-over-year improvement compared with last year’s full-year EPS of $1.23*. GAAP earnings per share were $1.73.    

  ·    The very successful integration of Corning Precision Materials Co., Ltd. resulted in pretax synergies of greater than $100 million, which exceeded the company’s original expectations.

*These are non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided in the tables following this news release, as well as on the company’s website. Core performance metrics (non-GAAP) are adjusted to exclude the impact of changes in Japanese yen and Korean won foreign exchange rates, as well as other items that do not reflect ongoing operations of the company. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of attached Form 8-K for details on core performance measures. 

“2014 was one of the strongest years in Corning’s history,” Wendell P. Weeks, chairman, chief executive officer and president, remarked. “Our sales exceeded $10 billion* for the first time in the company’s history, with 29% core sales growth, and 22% core earnings improvement from a year ago. We have now produced two full years of quarterly year-over-year earnings growth. 

“We started the year with a clear priority to grow sales and earnings. We achieved this with outstanding growth in our Optical Communications and Environmental Technologies segments, and a very successful integration of Corning Precision Materials. We also introduced several new technology innovations in 2014, highlighted by Corning® Gorilla® Glass 4, which launched in November. 

“We continued to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders with the 20% increase in the company’s stock dividend and the additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program that was announced in December.” 

Fourth-Quarter Segment Results 

Core sales in the Display Technologies segment were $1.1 billion*, a 69% increase from $665 million* in last year’s fourth quarter, driven by the Corning Precision Materials acquisition. Core earnings for the quarter increased 26% on a year-over-year basis. Sustained retail demand for larger LCD television sizes drove stronger-than-expected glass volume in the quarter, while glass pricing declined less than in the third quarter, continuing a trend of moderating declines. 

Optical Communications segment core sales were $676 million*, a 12% increase from last year’s fourth quarter. The fourth-quarter performance was better than expected, driven primarily by strength in North American Fiber-to-the-Home sales. Fourth-quarter core earnings were $59 million* in the segment, up 64% year over year.

Environmental Technologies segment core sales were $250 million*, a 5% year-over-year increase from $238 million* in the comparable period. Global demand for Corning’s light-duty and heavy-duty emissions products remained strong. Core earnings were $40 million*, an increase of 5% on a year-over-year basis. 

Core sales in the Specialty Materials segment were $319 million*, a 12% increase year over year and stronger than the company anticipated. Fourth-quarter core earnings of $34 million* decreased 13% on a year-over-year basis. Without the write-off of a customer receivable, core earnings would have been up 8%. Corning introduced Gorilla Glass 4 in the fourth quarter amid strong consumer and manufacturer interest in improved mobile device screen-breakage resistance. Gorilla Glass 4 delivers up to two times improved breakage performance over competitive glass products. 

Corning’s Life Sciences segment core sales were $215 million*, increasing slightly from the $210 million* a year ago, and core earnings were $22 million*. The company’s core equity earnings from Dow Corning Corporation were strong at $111 million*. 

In the fourth quarter, Corning announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2016, and a 20% increase in its quarterly stock dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2015. Corning ended the fourth quarter and full year with $6.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. 

Financial Reporting Matters 

“Corning will be using a Japanese yen-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate of 99 in its core performance measures reporting in 2015,” James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said. “We adopted the use of constant currency reporting as a supplement to GAAP in early 2013 when the Japanese yen began a significant weakening trend relative to the U.S. dollar. We believe the constant exchange core-performance measures aid our investors in understanding our results. 

“We used a 93 yen-to-dollar rate for core reporting in 2013 and 2014, which was aligned with our hedge rates. We have entered into new hedges at a rate of 99 yen-to-dollar, so we think the constant yen rate of 99 is appropriate for 2015. Our new hedges extend through 2017, so we anticipate using this rate for three years. 

“The majority of our analysts have already converted their models to the 99 rate. We will be providing a recast of 2014 and 2013 results to the 99 rate in a Form 8-K to be furnished today. There are some nuances on recasting from a 93 to 99 rate, so our Investor Relations staff will be available to help investors update their models.” 

Flaws also noted that Corning’s capital spending for 2014 was $1.1 billion. “We anticipate 2015 capital spending to be in the $1.3 to $1.4 billion range,” he said. He also confirmed that the company has begun repurchasing shares under its new $1.5 billion authorization. 

Looking Forward 

“We are entering 2015 with momentum. We are expecting sales growth again this year in Optical Communications and Environmental Technologies. And we anticipate that growing demand for Gorilla Glass will improve the Specialty Materials segment results,” Flaws remarked. 

“We expect that another strong year of manufacturing process improvements and cost reductions, in combination with sales growth, will deliver overall earnings growth for Corning this year,” he noted.

In the first quarter, Corning anticipates LCD glass volume in its Display Technologies segment will be consistent to down slightly on a sequential basis, following a very strong fourth-quarter performance. This is in line with normal seasonality in the business. Quarterly glass price declines are expected to be moderate again. 

Optical Communications segment first-quarter core sales are expected to increase by more than 10 percent on a year-over-year basis, as the segment continues its strong overall performance. In the Environmental Technologies segment, core sales are anticipated to be consistent year over year. First-quarter sales for Corning’s Life Sciences segment should be comparable to last year’s first quarter. 

Specialty Materials segment sales are expected to increase by approximately 10 percent versus last year’s first-quarter performance, the result of increased Gorilla Glass demand for products launched in the third and fourth quarters of 2014.

Presentation of Information in this News Release 

Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company’s operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP financial measures assists in analyzing financial performance without the impact of items that may obscure trends in the company’s underlying performance. Detailed reconciliations outlining the differences between these non-GAAP measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on the company’s website by going to www.corning.com/investor_relations and clicking “Financial Reports” on the left. These reconciliations also accompany this news release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at Core Performance measures. We believe reporting Core Performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions. Net sales, equity in earnings of affiliated companies, and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the Japanese yen and Korean won, the impact of the purchased and zero cost collars, average forward contracts and other yen-related transactions, acquisition-related costs, the 2013 results of the polysilicon business of our equity affiliate Dow Corning Corporation, discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation and regulatory expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments, and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Management discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP reporting measures. Further explanation of the Company’s reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this document.

CORNING INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at Core Performance measures. We believe reporting Core Performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions. Core net sales, Core equity earnings of affiliated companies, Core income before income taxes, Core earnings, Core earnings per share, Core gross margin and Core gross margin percentage and Core selling, general and administrative expenses are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the Japanese yen, the impact of the purchased collars, average forward contracts and other yen-related transactions, acquisition-related costs, the 2013 results of the polysilicon business of our equity affiliate Dow Corning Corporation, discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation and regulatory expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments, and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP reporting measures. 

The following is an explanation of each adjustment that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each item: 

Items which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at Core Performance measures are as follows: 

  (1)   Constant-currency adjustments:  

    Constant-yen: Because a significant portion of Corning’s LCD glass business revenues and manufacturing costs are denominated in Japanese yen, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings of translating yen into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-yen basis mitigates the translation impact of the Japanese yen, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts. As of December 31, 2014, we used an internally derived management rate of ¥93, which is aligned to our yen portfolio of purchased collars, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the Japanese yen.  

    Constant-won: Following the Acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials and because a significant portion of Samsung Corning Precision Materials’(now Corning Precision Materials) costs are denominated in Korean won, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings from translating won into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-won basis mitigates the translation impact of the Korean won, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts without the variability caused by the fluctuations caused by changes in the rate of this currency. We use an internally derived management rate of 1,100, which is consistent with historical prior period averages of the won. We have not recast prior periods presented as the impact is not material to Corning in those periods.  

  (2)   Purchased and zero cost collars, average forward contracts and other yen-related transactions: We have excluded the impact of our yen-denominated purchased collars, average forward contracts, and other yen-related transactions for each period presented. Additionally, we are also excluding the impact of our portfolio of Korean won-denominated zero cost collars which we entered into in the second quarter of 2014. By aligning an internally derived rate with our portfolio of purchased collars and average forward contracts, and excluding other yen-related transactions and the constant-currency adjustments, we have materially mitigated the impact of changes in the Japanese yen and Korean won.

  (3)   Results of Dow Corning’s consolidated subsidiary, Hemlock Semiconductor: In 2013, we excluded the results of Dow Corning’s consolidated subsidiary, Hemlock Semiconductor, a producer of polycrystalline silicon, to remove the operating and non-operating items and events which have caused severe unpredictability and instability in earnings beginning in 2012. These events were primarily driven by the macro-economic environment. Specifically, the negative impact of the determination by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), which imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on solar-grade polysilicon imports from the United States, and the impact of asset write-offs, offset by the benefit of large payments required under Hemlock Semiconductor customers’ “take-or-pay” contracts, are events that are unrelated to Dow Corning’s core operations, and that have, or could have, significant impacts to this business. Beginning in 2014, due to the stabilization of the polycrystalline silicon industry, we will no longer exclude the operating results of Hemlock Semiconductor from core performance measures.  

  (4)   Acquisition-related costs: These expenses include intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs.  

  (5)   Discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: This represents the removal of discrete adjustments attributable to changes in tax law and changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, as well as other non-operational tax-related adjustments, including an out of period adjustment in 2014. This item also includes the income tax effects of adjusting from GAAP earnings to core earnings.  

  (6)   Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: Includes amounts related to the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) asbestos litigation, adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and the settlement of litigation related to a small acquisition.  

  (7)   Restructuring, impairment and other charges. This amount includes restructuring, impairment and other charges, as well as other expenses and disposal costs not classified as restructuring expense.  

  (8)   Liquidation of subsidiary: The partial impact of non-restructuring related items due to the decision to liquidate a consolidated subsidiary that is not significant.  

  (9)   Equity in earnings of affiliated companies: These adjustments relate to items which do not reflect expected on-going operating results of our affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges and settlements under “take-or-pay” contracts.  

  (10)   Impacts from the Acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials: Pre-acquisition gains and losses on previously held equity investment and other gains and losses related to the Acquisition, including post-combination expenses, fair value adjustments to the indemnity asset related to contingent consideration and the impact of the withholding tax on a dividend from Samsung Corning Precision Materials.  

  (11)   Pension mark-to-market adjustment: Mark-to-market pension gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates. In accordance with GAAP, Corning recognizes pension actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, for our defined benefit pension plans annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever a plan is remeasured or valuation estimates are finalized. Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from the estimates used to allocate the change in value of pension plans to expense throughout the year or when assumptions change, as they may each year. Significant factors that can contribute to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses include changes in discount rates, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, and other changes in actuarial assumptions such as life expectancy of plan participants. Management believes that pension actuarial gains and losses are primarily financing activities that are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets, and are not directly related to the underlying performance of our businesses.  

  (12)   Gain on change in control of equity investment: Gain as a result of certain changes to the shareholder agreement of an equity company, resulting in Corning having a controlling interest that requires consolidation of this investment.  

  (13)   Loss on repurchase of debt: In 2012, Corning recorded a loss on the repurchase of $13 million of our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2021, $11 million of our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2016, and $51 million of our 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2013.  

  (14)   Accumulated other comprehensive income: In 2012, Corning recorded a translation capital gain on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.
