Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On January 9, 2015, Acuity Brands, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release containing information about the Company's results of operations for its fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2014. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. The information contained in this paragraph, as well as Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933.

The press release includes the following non-GAAP financial measures: “adjusted selling, distribution, and administrative (“SD&A”) expenses,” “adjusted operating profit,” “adjusted operating profit margin,” “adjusted net income,” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share” (“EPS”). These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the reader's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted SD&A expenses, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items for special charges associated with efforts to streamline the organization as well as the incremental recoveries associated with previously disclosed fraud perpetrated at the freight payment and audit service firm formerly retained by the Company. Management believes these items impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that they are not reflective of the fixed costs or benefits that the Company will incur over the long term. However, the Company has incurred similar charges associated with streamlining activities in prior fiscal years and continually evaluates streamlining measures which could result in additional charges in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted SD&A expenses is “SD&A expenses” which includes the benefit of the insurance recovery related to the previously reported fraud. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS are “operating profit,” “operating profit margin,” “net income,” and “diluted EPS,” respectively, which include the impact of the special charges as well as the incremental recoveries associated with the aforementioned fraud. 

Item 8.01. Other Events.

On January 7, 2015, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 13 cents per share. A copy of the related press release is attached as exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
