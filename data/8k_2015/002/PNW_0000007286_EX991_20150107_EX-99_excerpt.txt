Delivering Superior Shareholder Value2 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This presentation contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, including statements regarding our earnings guidance and financial outlook and goals. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as “estimate,” “predict,” “may,” “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “require,” “intend,” “assume” and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. These factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to manage capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs while maintaining reliability and customer service levels; variations in demand for electricity, including those due to weather, the general economy, customer and sales growth (or decline), and the effects of energy conservation measures and distributed generation; power plant and transmission system performance and outages; competition in retail and wholesale power markets; regulatory and judicial decisions, developments and proceedings; new legislation or regulation, including those relating to environmental requirements, nuclear plant operations and potential deregulation of retail electric markets; fuel and water supply availability; our ability to achieve timely and adequate rate recovery of our costs, including returns on debt and equity capital; our ability to meet renewable energy and energy efficiency mandates and recover related costs; risks inherent in the operation of nuclear facilities, including spent fuel disposal uncertainty; current and future economic conditions in Arizona, particularly in real estate markets; the cost of debt and equity capital and the ability to access capital markets when required; environmental and other concerns surrounding coal-fired generation; volatile fuel and purchased power costs; the investment performance of the assets of our nuclear decommissioning trust, pension, and other postretirement benefit plans and the resulting impact on future funding requirements; the liquidity of wholesale power markets and the use of derivative contracts in our business; potential shortfalls in insurance coverage; new accounting requirements or new interpretations of existing requirements; generation, transmission and distribution facility and system conditions and operating costs; the ability to meet the anticipated future need for additional baseload generation and associated transmission facilities in our region; the willingness or ability of our counterparties, power plant participants and power plant land owners to meet contractual or other obligations or extend the rights for continued power plant operations; technological developments affecting the electric industry; and restrictions on dividends or other provisions in our credit agreements and ACC orders. These and other factors are discussed in Risk Factors described in Part I, Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 and in Part II, Item 1A for the Pinnacle West/APS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, which you should review carefully before placing any reliance on our financial statements, disclosures or earnings outlook. Neither Pinnacle West nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements, even if our internal estimates change, except as required by law.

The proposal would save more than $350 million in emission control upgrades. $0 Navajo 1-3 Up to ~$200M for SCRs and baghouses, expected to occur after 2015 On July 28, 2014, EPA issued the final BART rule incorporating the better-than-BART alternative proposed by SRP and others, which would defer spend until 2021 or later SRP, the operating agent, is evaluating compliance options To be determined To be determined Note: Dollars shown at ownership. Estimates as of September 30, 2014. • Cholla Unit 1 is not BART-eligible. Cholla Unit 4 is owned by PacifiCorp. • SO2 NAAQS and greenhouse gas-related costs will be determined based upon EPA rule makings, with no spend occurring before 2016. • ACI = Activated Carbon Injection; NAAQS = National Ambient Air Quality Standard; SCR = Selective catalytic reduction control technology ENVIRONMENTAL Regional Haze compliance is the biggest driver of environmental spend over the next 3-4 years Note: On June 2, 2014, EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan to achieve state-specific goals to achieve carbon dioxide emission reductions measured from a 2012 baseline. States would be required to submit their plan by June 2016. States may be eligible for one or two year extensions (for sources on Native American land, including Four Corners and Navajo, EPA is expected to issue a final plan by June 2015). Impact to APS is under review.

Delivering Superior Shareholder Value43 • Customers with rooftop solar systems do not pay for all of the electric services they use (i.e. rooftop customers still need support from the grid 24 hours a day) • These unpaid costs are then paid, through higher rates, by non-rooftop solar customers • The issue will get bigger over time as applications and installs continue to increase NET METERING Rooftop solar customers still use the grid 24 hours a day TYPICAL GRID INTERACTION FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR  

Delivering Superior Shareholder Value44 OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS WITH INCREASED VARIABLE GENERATION The grid provides real-time voltage and power needed to start air conditioners and other motors loads (for typical AC unit) • Steep ramp rate of backup generation • Instant variability • Voltage control at distribution level
