 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On February 5, 2015, Prologis, Inc. (the “Company”) renewed a previously established “at-the-market” equity offering program and added managers to the program. On February 5, 2015, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, the “Managers”), pursuant to which the Company appointed the Managers to act as its sales agents with respect to the issuance and sale over time and from time to time of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $750,000,000 (the “Shares”) in an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of the Agreement has been filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to the Agreement, each of the Managers is entitled to receive compensation in the amount of up to 2.0% of the gross sales price of the Shares sold by it pursuant to the Agreement. The offering of the Shares will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all of the shares of the Company’s common stock subject to the Agreement, or (ii) termination of the Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events.  

This renewed “at-the-market” equity offering program replaces and supersedes the program the Company previously established on June 26, 2013. The $750 million aggregate offering price of the Shares to be offered under this program includes shares of common stock that remain unsold under the previous program.  

The Shares are subject to the Registration Statement that the Company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 16, 2014 relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Company pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with the Company filing with the SEC a prospectus supplement, dated February 5, 2015, to the Company’s prospectus, dated April 16, 2014, relating to the public offering of the Shares, the Company is filing certain exhibits as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K. See “Item 9.01 – Financial Statements and Exhibits.”  

This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
