Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On January 29, 2015, Hanesbrands Inc. (“HanesBrands”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 3, 2015. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Exhibit 99.1 is being “furnished” and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall Exhibit 99.1 be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99.1 contains disclosures about adjusted EPS, adjusted operating profit (and margin) and EBITDA, which are not generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) measures. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS excluding actions and the tax effect on actions. Adjusted operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding actions. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. HanesBrands has chosen to provide these measures to investors to enable additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means of evaluating company performance absent the effect of acquisition-related expenses and other actions. This non-GAAP information should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP or other pro forma measures used by other companies.
