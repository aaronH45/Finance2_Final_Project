SAN FRANCISCO - February 26, 2015 - Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today reported fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014 results and provided guidance for fiscal year 2015.

“Looking ahead at 2015, we will continue executing our global growth strategy, bringing new digital capabilities to life and making the shifts necessary to consistently deliver the brand-right, emotional product that our customers expect from all of our brands,” said Art Peck, chief executive officer, Gap Inc. “I’ve moved quickly to assemble a talented team of leaders who share my sense of urgency and, together, we’re focused and ready for the year ahead.” 

Business Highlights 

•The company’s largest global brand, Old Navy, delivered positive comparable sales results during each quarter of fiscal year 2014, including a positive 11 percent increase during the fourth quarter. 

•Gap Inc. continued to execute its long-term global growth strategy by adding 39 new stores in greater China during fiscal year 2014, including 7 new Old Navy stores and 32 new Gap stores. Additionally, the company announced plans to open about 40 new stores in greater China during fiscal year 2015. 

•Building on its success as a performance and lifestyle brand, Athleta grew its U.S. footprint to 101 stores during fiscal year 2014, and the brand plans to open about 20 additional U.S. stores during fiscal year 2015. 

•During fiscal year 2014, Gap Inc. continued to deliver new digital capabilities to customers and made further progress in mobile and personalization.

Fourth Quarter Results

Net sales were up 3 percent to $4.71 billion, compared with $4.58 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. The company’s fourth quarter comparable sales were positive 2 percent versus positive 1 percent last year. 

On a constant currency basis, net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 increased 5 percent compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. In calculating net sales growth on a constant currency basis, current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year net sales. This is done to enhance the visibility of underlying sales trends, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 

Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 was $319 million. Earnings per share increased 10 percent to $0.75 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $0.68 per share during the fourth quarter last year. 

1  In calculating earnings per share excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the company estimates current gross margins using the appropriate prior year rates (including the impact of merchandise-related hedges), translates current period foreign earnings at prior year rates, and excludes the year-over-year earnings impact of balance sheet remeasurement and gains or losses from non-merchandise-related foreign currency hedges. This is done in order to enhance the visibility of business results excluding the direct impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Fiscal Year 2014 Results

For fiscal year 2014, net sales increased 2 percent to $16.44 billion, compared with net sales of $16.15 billion for the 2013 fiscal year, driven by strong performance at Old Navy. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 3 percent for fiscal year 2014. 

Net income for fiscal year 2014 was $1.26 billion, or $2.87 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $2.74 per share on a diluted basis for the 2013 fiscal year.

The company’s comparable sales for fiscal year 2014 were flat versus a 2 percent increase last year. Comparable sales by global brand for the 2014 fiscal year were as follows:

•Gap Global: negative 5 percent versus positive 3 percent last year

RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO FREE CASH FLOW

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

__________

(a) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP results.
