CAMPBELL REPORTS SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS

•Sales Decreased 2 Percent, Organic Sales Comparable to Prior Year 

•Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) Decreased 17 Percent

•Adjusted EPS from Continuing Operations Decreased 13 Percent to $0.66

CAMDEN, N.J., Feb. 25, 2015-Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) today reported its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: A detailed reconciliation of the reported financial information to the adjusted financial information is included at the end of this news release.

Campbell’s President and Chief Executive Officer Denise Morrison said, “Our second-quarter organic sales were comparable to the year-ago period. Adjusted EBIT declined by double digits, reflecting disappointing gross margin performance in the quarter, and was below our expectations. Looking at the first half, we were encouraged by our 2 percent organic sales growth in a difficult 

operating environment. For the half, four of our five reporting segments achieved organic sales growth. 

“Although we have robust plans in the second half to mitigate our gross margin issues, we don’t expect to offset the impact of the margin pressures that we experienced in the first half. Given our second-quarter performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we lowered our full-year guidance on Feb. 12.

“Over the last three years, we’ve made solid progress advancing our dual mandate to strengthen the core business and at the same time expand into faster growing spaces; however, it has not been enough in this more challenged environment. After several months of careful study, we’ve announced a significant reorganization of our company creating three new divisions, each with clear portfolio roles. This new enterprise structure will enable us to allocate more resources to the areas that present the greatest growth opportunities and fund our growth with significant cost savings. We expect to generate annual cost savings of at least $200 million over a three-year period using a zero-based budgeting approach. We don’t anticipate significant savings from these efforts in the current fiscal year, but are confident that the important steps we are taking will unlock potential value over time.”

Second-Quarter Results from Continuing Operations 

Sales decreased 2 percent to $2.234 billion, due to the negative impact of currency translation. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year with favorable volume and mix and higher selling prices, offset by increased promotional spending.

Gross margin declined 3.1 percentage points to 32.6 percent. The decrease in gross margin was due to cost inflation, higher supply chain costs and higher promotional spending, partly offset by productivity improvements. 

Marketing and selling expenses decreased 10 percent to $242 million, primarily driven by lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses. Administrative expenses decreased 1 percent to $140 million. 

Adjusted EBIT decreased 17 percent to $312 million, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage and the unfavorable impact of currency translation, partly offset by lower marketing expenses. 

2

Net interest expense decreased $4 million to $25 million, reflecting lower levels of debt. The tax rate decreased 3.4 percentage points to 27.9 percent. Excluding items impacting comparability in the prior year, the adjusted tax rate decreased 3.1 percentage points. The decrease was primarily due to the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement between the U.S. and Canada.

First-Half Results from Continuing Operations 

Sales increased 1 percent to $4.489 billion, due to volume gains, partly offset by increased promotional spending and the negative impact of currency translation. Organic sales increased 2 percent with gains in four of the company’s five reportable segments.

Adjusted EBIT decreased 4 percent to $680 million, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage and the unfavorable impact of currency translation, partly offset by volume gains and lower marketing and administrative expenses. 

Net interest expense decreased $9 million to $50 million, reflecting lower levels of debt. The tax rate decreased 2.8 percentage points to 30 percent. Excluding items impacting comparability in the prior year, the adjusted tax rate decreased 1.6 percentage points. 

Fiscal 2015 Guidance for Continuing Operations 

As previously announced, including an estimated 2-point negative impact from currency translation, Campbell expects a year-over-year change of -1 to +1 percent in sales; -7 to -5 percent in adjusted EBIT; and -5 to -3 percent in adjusted EPS, or $2.32 to $2.38 per share. This guidance is based on an adjusted 52-week 2014 base. 

“This guidance assumes that pressure from input cost inflation and supply chain costs, although moderating, will continue through the back half of fiscal 2015 along with the currency headwinds,” said Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

U.S. Simple Meals

Sales decreased 3 percent in the quarter to $867 million. Following a strong first quarter, U.S. soup sales decreased 6 percent, primarily due to movements in retailer inventory levels, including the earlier holiday shipments that benefited the prior quarter. Sales decreased 11 percent in Campbell’s condensed soups and 4 percent in broth, while sales of ready-to-serve soups were comparable to the prior year. U.S. soup sales in the first half were comparable to the prior year. Sales of other simple meals rose 6 percent in the quarter, driven by growth in Plum, Prego pasta sauces and Campbell’s dinner sauces.

Segment operating earnings decreased 21 percent in the quarter to $170 million. Lower operating earnings reflected cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, as well as sales declines, partly offset by productivity improvements and lower marketing expenses. For the first half, operating earnings decreased 3 percent.

Global Baking and Snacking 

Sales of $640 million in the quarter were comparable to the prior year. Sales of Pepperidge Farm products increased as volume gains were partly offset by higher promotional spending. Within Pepperidge Farm, sales gains in crackers, fresh bakery products and cookies were partly offset by sales declines in frozen products and stuffing. Arnott’s sales increased as volume gains in Indonesia and Australia, along with higher selling prices, were partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation and higher promotional spending. Kelsen sales decreased primarily due to the timing of the quarter in relation to the Chinese New Year.

Segment operating earnings increased 22 percent to $107 million. Higher operating earnings reflected organic sales growth, lower marketing expenses and productivity improvements, partly offset by cost inflation and the negative impact of currency translation. 

International Simple Meals and Beverages

Sales declined 9 percent in the quarter to $194 million. Excluding the 7-point negative impact of currency translation, sales declined in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region while sales in Canada were comparable to the prior year.

Segment operating earnings decreased 32 percent to $26 million, primarily due to cost inflation, the adverse impact of currency movements on input costs and the negative impact of currency translation. 

5

U.S. Beverages

Sales decreased 4 percent in the quarter to $169 million. Declines in V8 V-Fusion beverages were partly offset by gains in V8 Splash beverages.

Segment operating earnings decreased 35 percent to $20 million, primarily due to increased promotional spending, cost inflation and higher supply chain costs. 

Bolthouse and Foodservice

Sales increased 1 percent in the quarter to $364 million, reflecting growth in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings and North America Foodservice, partly offset by declines in Bolthouse Farms carrots.

Segment operating earnings declined 28 percent to $26 million, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage, including the adverse weather impact on carrot costs, and higher administrative expenses. 

Unallocated Corporate Expenses

Unallocated corporate expenses for the quarter were $37 million compared with $33 million a year ago. 

Cash Flow from Operations

First-half cash flow from operations was $584 million compared to $363 million a year ago, primarily due to taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European simple meals business, and lower working capital requirements and pension contributions in 2015.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Campbell Soup Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in certain communications. These non-GAAP financial measures are measures of performance not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, GAAP reported measures.

Organic Net Sales

Organic net sales exclude the impact of acquisitions, currency and presenting revenue on a net basis in connection with a new business model in Mexico in fiscal 2014. The company believes that organic net sales improves the comparability of year-to-year results. A reconciliation of net sales as reported to organic net sales follows.

Items Impacting Gross Margin and Earnings

The company believes that financial information excluding certain transactions that are not considered to be part of the ongoing business improves the comparability of year-to-year results. Consequently, the company believes that investors may be able to better understand its gross margin and earnings results excluding these transactions.

The following items impacted gross margin and/or earnings:

(1)In fiscal 2014, the company implemented initiatives to streamline its salaried workforce in North America and its workforce in the Asia Pacific region; restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for its soup and broth business in China; improve supply chain efficiency in Australia; and reduce overhead across the organization. In the second quarter of fiscal 2014, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $13 million ($5 million after tax or $.02 per share in earnings from continuing operations attributable to Campbell Soup Company). The year-to-date 2014 impact was pre-tax restructuring charges of $33 million ($18 million after tax or $.06 per share in earnings from continuing operations attributable to Campbell Soup Company). For the year ended August 3, 2014, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $54 million ($33 million after tax or $.10 per share in earnings from continuing operations attributable to Campbell Soup Company). 

In fiscal 2013, the company implemented initiatives to improve its U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across its U.S. thermal plant network; expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico; improve its Pepperidge Farm bakery supply chain cost structure; and reduce overhead in North America. The year-to-date 2014 impact was pre-tax restructuring charges of $1 million and restructuring-related costs of $2 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $2 million after tax or $.01 per share on earnings from continuing operations). For the year ended August 3, 2014, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $1 million and restructuring-related costs of $3 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $3 million after tax or $.01 per share on earnings from continuing operations).

(2)On October 28, 2013, the company completed the sale of its simple meals business in Europe. The results of the business were reported as discontinued operations. In fiscal 2014, the company recorded a loss of $9 million ($6 million after tax or $.02 per share) on foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge the proceeds from the sale of the European simple meals business. The loss was included in earnings from continuing operations. In addition, the company recorded tax expense of $7 million ($.02 per share) in earnings from continuing operations associated with the sale. 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2014, the company recognized an after-tax gain of $90 million ($.28 per share) in earnings from discontinued operations. In fiscal 2014, the company recognized an after-tax gain of $72 million ($.23 per share) in earnings from discontinued operations.

(3)In fiscal 2014, the company recognized pension settlement charges associated with a U.S. pension plan. The settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan's assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in Sacramento, California. In fiscal 2014, the company recognized pre-tax pension settlement charges in Cost of products sold of $22 million ($14 million after tax or $.04 per share in earnings from continuing operations).

Adjusted Base for Fiscal 2015 Guidance

The company believes that financial information excluding certain transactions that are not considered to be part of the ongoing business improves the comparability of year-to-year results. The previous tables reconcile financial information, presented in accordance with GAAP, to financial information excluding certain items. Fiscal 2014 included 53 weeks. Consequently, the company believes that investors may be able to better understand its fiscal 2015 performance excluding certain transactions and the estimated impact of the 53rd week. In establishing guidance for fiscal 2015, the adjusted fiscal 2014 results are revised to exclude the estimated impact of the 53rd week below:
