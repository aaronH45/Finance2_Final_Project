DEARBORN, Mich., Feb. 3, 2015 – Ford Motor Company posted a 15 percent sales increase in the U.S. in January, with sales of 178,351 vehicles. Retail sales of 128,666 vehicles marked a 13 percent increase, providing the best retail January results since 2004. 

Retail passenger car sales were up 6 percent, utilities saw a 10 percent increase, and trucks gained 23 percent. 

“Customer demand is strong for our newest vehicles, driving retail sales gains across our lineup in January,” said Erich Merkle, U.S. sales analyst. “Momentum is especially strong for our 

F-Series pickup, with the all-new F-150 the hottest product on our dealer lots in January.”

F-Series, America’s best-selling truck for the 38th straight year, posted sales gains of 17 percent in January, with 54,370 trucks sold last month. This was F-Series’ best January sales volume since 2004 – an all-time annual record sales year for F-Series. 

Part of F-Series’ strength is the all-new F-150. It is the toughest, smartest, most capable F-150 ever, with best-in-class payload, towing and gasoline fuel economy and recently named 2015 North American Truck of the Year. It is averaging just 12 days on dealer lots. High-end Platinum and King Ranch F-150 are turning even faster, averaging just 9 and 10 days on dealer lots, respectively.
