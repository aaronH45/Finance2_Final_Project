HARTFORD, Conn., February 2, 2015 – The Hartford (NYSE:HIG) reported core earnings of $426 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2014 (fourth quarter 2014), up 12% from $382 million in fourth quarter 2013. The increase was principally due to improved property and casualty (P&C) underwriting results and a reduction in Corporate core losses, partially offset by lower net investment income. Fourth quarter 2014 core earnings per diluted share were $0.96, a 22% increase from $0.79 in fourth quarter 2013, reflecting core earnings growth and the 9% decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares resulting from the company's share repurchases during 2014.

Fourth quarter 2014 net income totaled $382 million, up 22% from $314 million in fourth quarter 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 net income included an $83 million, after-tax, charge for voluntary lump-sum pension settlements in the company's defined benefit pension plan for certain vested participants; there was no similar charge in fourth quarter 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 net income included income from discontinued operations of $37 million, after-tax, primarily related to a partial reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance established at the time of the sale of the Japan annuity business. Fourth quarter 2013 net income included a $70 million, after-tax, loss from discontinued operations, also associated largely with the Japan annuity business. Fourth quarter 2014 net income per diluted share was $0.86, up 32% from $0.65 per diluted share in

fourth quarter 2013, reflecting the 22% increase in net income and the accretive impact of share repurchases.

"Strong fourth quarter results concluded an outstanding year for The Hartford,” said The Hartford's Chairman and CEO Christopher Swift. “For the full year, expanding profit margins in P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds drove a 16% increase in core earnings per diluted share and a one point improvement in core earnings ROE to 8.4%. We also sold the Japan annuity business during the year, significantly reducing the company’s risk profile and contributing to the return of over $2 billion of capital to shareholders. As we enter 2015, I am pleased with how the company’s businesses are balancing profitability and top-line growth in this pricing and interest rate environment.”

"Our P&C businesses delivered another solid quarter, with a combined ratio of 93.8, a 3.7 point improvement over fourth quarter 2013," said The Hartford's President Doug Elliot. "For the year, our P&C combined ratio was 91.5 excluding catastrophes and prior year development, a 2.9 point improvement. In Group Benefits, we continued to see improvement in our margins, with a core earnings after-tax margin of 5.2%, a nearly one point increase from the prior year. While the pricing environment is becoming more challenging, we continue to see opportunities to invest in our businesses and drive profitable growth."

For the year ended Dec. 31, 2014 (full year 2014), core earnings were $1,548 million, up 9% from $1,419 million in full year 2013 principally due to improved P&C underwriting results, partially offset by lower net investment income. Full year 2014 core earnings per diluted share were $3.36, a 16% increase from $2.89 per diluted share in full year 2013 due to the growth in core earnings and the accretive impact of the company's share repurchases during 2014.

Full year 2014 net income totaled $798 million, up significantly from $176 million in full year 2013. Net income included net realized capital losses, after-tax and deferred acquisition costs (DAC), excluded from core earnings, of $20 million in full year 2014 compared with net realized capital gains, after-tax and DAC, excluded from core earnings, of $121 million in full year 2013. Full year 2014 net income also included a $551 million, after-tax, loss from discontinued operations associated largely with the Japan annuity business, which was sold in June 2014, while full year 2013 included a $1,049 million, after-tax, loss from discontinued operations, also largely related to the Japan annuity business. Full year 2014 net income per diluted share was $1.73, up from $0.36 in full year 2013, reflecting the growth in net income and the accretive impact of share repurchases.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMMERCIAL LINES

Fourth Quarter 2014 Highlights:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Standard Commercial renewal written pricing increases averaged 3%, in-line with loss cost trends

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Core earnings in Commercial Lines increased 10% in fourth quarter 2014 from fourth quarter 2013 due to improved underwriting results, partially offset by lower investment income. 

Commercial Lines underwriting gain rose significantly to $123 million in fourth quarter 2014 from $54 million in fourth quarter 2013 due to improved CAY results in Small Commercial and Middle Market. Fourth quarter 2014 combined ratio improved 4.2 points over fourth quarter 2013 to 92.4. Fourth quarter 2014 combined ratio, before catastrophes and PYD, improved by 4.1 points to 91.2 from 95.3 in fourth quarter 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 catastrophe losses decreased slightly to $6 million, before tax, compared with $7 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2013. 

Fourth quarter 2014 PYD was an unfavorable $13 million, before tax, compared with unfavorable PYD of $12 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2013. In both quarters, the majority of the unfavorable PYD was due to other reserve re-estimates outside of the workers' compensation line.

Fourth quarter 2014 written premiums in Commercial Lines grew 6% to $1,558 million from $1,463 million in fourth quarter 2013, reflecting growth of 5% in Small Commercial, 6% in Middle Market and 13% in Specialty Commercial. Written premium growth resulted from renewal written pricing increases, stronger new business production, and higher policy retention in Small Commercial and Middle Market. Specialty Commercial written premiums rose 13% due to a 29% increase in National Accounts written premium.

Renewal written pricing increases in fourth quarter 2014 for Standard Commercial, which is comprised of Small Commercial and certain Middle Market businesses, averaged 3%, down from 5% in third quarter 2014 and 7% in fourth quarter 2013. However, renewal written pricing increases were in-line with current loss cost trends. Renewal written pricing increases in fourth quarter 2014 averaged 3% in Small Commercial and 3% in Middle Market. 

New business premium for Small Commercial increased 10% over fourth quarter 2013 to $122 million driven by growth in workers' compensation and package business. Middle Market new business premium increased 30% from fourth quarter 2013 to $131 million as a result of strong growth in workers' compensation, particularly among larger accounts. 

Improved policy count retention also contributed to written premium growth. Small Commercial retention was 85% in fourth quarter 2014, a three point improvement from 82% in fourth quarter 2013. Middle Market policy count retention for fourth quarter 2014 was 80%, up one point over fourth quarter 2013.

PERSONAL LINES

Fourth Quarter 2014 Highlights:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Core earnings in Personal Lines increased 33% in fourth quarter 2014 over the prior year quarter due to improved underwriting results, including lower catastrophes, which were partially offset by lower net investment income and lower servicing income due to the sale of Catalyst360.

Personal Lines underwriting gain increased to $60 million in fourth quarter 2014 compared with $18 million in fourth quarter 2013 due to improved CAY underwriting results, including lower catastrophe losses. Fourth quarter 2014 combined ratio was 93.8, a 4.3 point improvement compared to fourth quarter 2013 combined ratio of 98.1. CAY catastrophe losses totaled $13 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2014 compared with $21 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2013. Unfavorable PYD in fourth quarter 2014 totaled $6 million, before tax, compared with no net PYD in fourth quarter 2013. 

Before catastrophes and PYD, fourth quarter 2014 combined ratio was 91.8, a 4.0 point improvement from 95.8 in fourth quarter 2013 due to a better CAY loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) ratio and a lower expense ratio. Fourth quarter 2014 CAY loss and LAE ratio of 66.1 improved 3.0 points from 69.1 in fourth quarter 2013, primarily due to favorable loss cost trends in homeowners and strong earned pricing in both auto and homeowners. Fourth quarter 2014 expense ratio declined to 25.7% from 26.7% in fourth quarter 2013, reflecting lower compensation and technology expenses. 

Fourth quarter 2014 Personal Lines written premiums rose 3% from fourth quarter 2013 as a result of new business premium and renewal written pricing increases. New business premium in fourth quarter 2014 totaled $129 million, 2% higher than fourth quarter 2013 due to growth in auto. Renewal written price increases in fourth quarter 2014 averaged 6% in auto and 8% in homeowners, compared with 5% and 8%, respectively, in fourth quarter 2013. Fourth quarter 

9

2014 premium retention for auto was stable at 87% while homeowners declined two points to 90%. 

10

P&C OTHER OPERATIONS

Fourth quarter 2014 underwriting loss increased to $24 million compared with a loss of $9 million in fourth quarter 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 results included unfavorable PYD of $10 million, before tax, while fourth quarter 2013 had unfavorable PYD of $3 million, before tax. Unfavorable PYD in fourth quarter 2014 was due to adverse development on certain exposures that are in runoff, including employers' liability claims in the U.K.

GROUP BENEFITS

Fourth Quarter 2014 Highlights:

•Excluding the run-off of the Association-Financial Institutions (A-FI) block of business, fully insured ongoing premiums declined 3% from fourth quarter 2013[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[1] Fully insured ongoing premiums excludes buyout premiums and premium equivalents; excludes A-FI premiums of $2 million and $65 million in fourth quarter 2014 and 2013, respectively

[2] The A-FI block of business had no impact on core earnings in the periods presented

Fourth quarter 2014 Group Benefits core earnings totaled $45 million, an 18% decrease from $55 million in fourth quarter 2013, primarily due to lower margins on group disability, partially offset by improved margins on group life. Net investment income was also down in the quarter on lower invested assets. Net income in fourth quarter 2014 totaled $48 million, down from $58 million in fourth quarter 2013, reflecting the decrease in core earnings.

Excluding A-FI, the loss ratio was 76.0% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.3 points due to less favorable group disability results compared to fourth quarter 2013. While disability recovery rates continued to be strong in fourth quarter 2014, the loss ratio increased as fourth quarter 2013 benefited from reserve releases that reflected improved recovery rates on claims incurred in 2013 and prior years. 

The group life loss ratio, excluding A-FI, was 71.8%, a 2.8 point improvement due to favorable mortality results. Excluding A-FI, the expense ratio of 27.9% was flat versus fourth quarter 2014. The core earnings margin decreased to 5.3% from 5.9% in fourth quarter 2013, reflecting less favorable group disability results compared with the prior year quarter, partially offset by improved group life results.

Fourth quarter 2014 fully insured ongoing premiums, excluding A-FI, were $737 million, down 3% from fourth quarter 2013.

MUTUAL FUNDS

Fourth Quarter 2014 Highlights:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Mutual Fund sales increased 10% over fourth quarter 2014 to $3.9 billion[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Core earnings for the Mutual Funds segment rose 35% to $27 million in fourth quarter 2014 compared with $20 million in fourth quarter 2013. Core earnings grew as a result of increased fee revenue due to higher average Mutual Fund AUM and a favorable state income tax benefit. Mutual Fund AUM includes funds sold primarily through retail, bank trust and registered investment advisor channels and excludes AUM associated with the Talcott Resolution segment. The increase in average Mutual Fund AUM was driven by higher equity capital market levels compared with fourth quarter 2013. Net income for fourth quarter 2014 rose 21% to $23 million compared with $19 million in fourth quarter 2013.

Fourth quarter 2014 Mutual Fund net outflows totaled $1.1 billion compared with net outflows of $0.4 billion in fourth quarter 2013. Excluding a planned AUM transfer of $0.7 billion within The Hartford, fourth quarter 2014 net outflows were $0.4 billion. Mutual Fund sales increased 10% to $3.9 billion in fourth quarter 2014. 

Total AUM for the Mutual Funds segment declined 3% to $93.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2014 from $96.7 billion at Dec. 30, 2013 including the impact of $2.7 billion of planned AUM transfers within the company during fourth quarter 2014. Including this transfer, Talcott Resolution AUM declined 20% during 2014. Mutual Fund AUM increased 3% during 2014, including the planned $0.7 billion AUM transfer in fourth quarter 2014 and planned $0.7 billion fund liquidation in second quarter 2014.

TALCOTT RESOLUTION 

Fourth Quarter 2014 Highlights:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Talcott Resolution fourth quarter 2014 core earnings were $98 million, a 1% decrease from fourth quarter 2013 as reduced fee income due to the run-off of the VA block was partially offset by lower expenses, including lower costs related to contract holder initiatives. During the quarter, expenses for the 2014 VA Enhanced Surrender Value (ESV) program and fixed annuity Increased Surrender Value program totaled $1 million, after-tax and DAC, compared with $3 million, after-tax and DAC, of costs for the 2013 ESV program in fourth quarter 2013. 

Net income for Talcott Resolution in fourth quarter 2014 totaled $144 million compared with a net loss of $15 million in fourth quarter 2013. Net income included an unlock benefit of $13 million, after-tax, compared with a fourth quarter 2013 unlock benefit of $1 million, after-tax. Fourth quarter 2014 net income included income from discontinued operations of $31 million, after-tax, primarily related to a partial reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance established when the Japan annuity business was sold in June 2014. Fourth quarter 2013 net income included a $70 million, after-tax, loss from discontinued operations, also associated largely with the Japan annuity business.

VA and fixed annuity contract counts as of Dec. 31, 2014 declined 3% each from Sept. 30, 2014 and 13% and 18%, respectively, from Dec. 31, 2013.

INVESTMENTS 

Fourth Quarter 2014 Highlights:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Net impairment losses, including mortgage loan loss reserves, totaled $17 million, before tax

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[1] Yields, before tax, calculated using annualized net investment income divided by the monthly average invested assets at cost, amortized cost, or adjusted carrying value, as applicable, excluding repurchase agreement collateral, if any.

Fourth quarter 2014 net investment income totaled $752 million, before tax, a 7% decrease from fourth quarter 2013 due to lower investment income on LPs and the impact of declining asset levels in Talcott Resolution, and, to a lesser extent, lower annualized investment yields.

Annualized investment yield, before tax, which includes investment income on LPs, decreased to 4.2% in fourth quarter 2014, down from 4.4% in fourth quarter 2013 due primarily to lower investment income from LPs. LPs generated investment income of $44 million, before tax, for an annualized return of 6.0% in fourth quarter 2014 compared with $80 million, before tax, or 10.6%, in fourth quarter 2013. 

Excluding LPs, fourth quarter 2014 annualized investment yield, before tax, decreased to 4.1% compared with 4.2% in fourth quarter 2013. The reduction in annualized investment yield was primarily due to lower reinvestment rates in 2014 compared with 2013.

The credit performance of the company's general account assets remained strong. Net impairment losses in fourth quarter 2014, including changes in mortgage loan loss reserves, totaled $17 million, before tax, compared with $15 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2013. 

The carrying value of total invested assets, excluding equity securities, trading, was $76.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014 compared with $78.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2013. The decline in assets is largely due to the sale of the Japan annuity business in second quarter 2014.

•Stockholders' equity totaled $18.7 billion, down slightly from Dec. 31, 2013[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Hartford’s stockholders’ equity was $18.7 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014, down slightly from $18.9 billion as of Dec. 31, 2013, primarily due to common share repurchases of $1,796 million and common dividends of $290 million, largely offset by net income of $798 million and a $1,007 million increase in AOCI primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates at Dec. 31, 2014. 2014 net income included losses on discontinued operations of $551 million, after-tax, principally from the loss on sale of the Japan annuity business. 

Book value per diluted common share was $42.84 as of Dec. 31, 2014, an increase of 9% compared with $39.14 as of Dec. 31, 2013. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted common share was up 4% to $40.71 as of Dec. 31, 2014, compared with $39.30 as of Dec. 31, 2013.

Because The Hartford's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing The Hartford's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. Definitions and calculations of other financial measures used in this press release can be found below and in The Hartford's Investor Financial Supplement for fourth quarter 2014, which is available on The Hartford's website, http://ir.thehartford.com.

Book value per diluted common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI”): Book value per diluted common share excluding AOCI is a non-GAAP financial measure based on a GAAP financial measure. It is calculated by dividing (a) common stockholders' equity excluding AOCI, after-tax, by (b) common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares. The Hartford provides book value per diluted common share excluding AOCI to enable investors to analyze the company’s stockholders’ equity excluding the effect of changes in the value of the company’s investment portfolio and other assets due to interest rates, currency and other factors. The Hartford believes book value per diluted common share excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in market value. Book value per diluted common share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of book value per diluted common share, including AOCI to book value per diluted common share, excluding AOCI is set forth below.

Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development: Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development (PYD) is a non-GAAP financial measure. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. This ratio measures the cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates a positive underwriting result. A combined ratio above 100 indicates a negative underwriting result. The combined ratio before catastrophes and PYD represents the combined ratio for the current accident year, excluding the impact of current accident year catastrophes. The company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve. A reconciliation of the combined ratio to the combined ratio before catastrophes and PYD is provided in the table below.

Core Earnings: The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings as an important measure of the company’s operating performance. The Hartford believes that the measure core earnings provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the company’s ongoing businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain realized capital gains and losses, discontinued operations, pension settlements, loss on extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on business disposition transactions, certain restructuring charges and the impact of Unlocks to deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), sales inducement assets ("SIA"), unearned revenue reserves ("URR") and death and other insurance benefit reserve balances. Some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business.

Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses (net of tax and the effects of DAC) that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized capital gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic settlements on credit derivatives and net periodic settlements on the Japan fixed annuity cross-currency swap. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the income statement such as net investment income. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of the company’s business. Therefore, the Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate both net income (loss) and core earnings when reviewing the company’s performance.

A reconciliation of core earnings to net income (loss) for the quarterly periods ended Dec. 31, 2014 and 2013, is included in this press release. A reconciliation of core earnings to net income (loss) for individual reporting segments can be found in this press release under the heading "The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Consolidating Income Statements" and in The Hartford's Investor Financial Supplement for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014.

Core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share: Core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share is calculated based on the non-GAAP financial measure core earnings. It is calculated by dividing (a) core earnings, by (b) diluted common shares outstanding. The Hartford believes that the measure core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share provides investors with a valuable measure of the company's operating performance for the same reasons applicable to its underlying measure, core earnings. Net income (loss) per diluted common share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) per diluted share and does not reflect the overall profitability of the company's business.

Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate both net income (loss)per diluted share and core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share when reviewing the company's performance. A reconciliation of core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share to net income (loss) per diluted common share for the quarterly periods ended Dec. 31, 2014 and 2013 is included in this press release under the heading “The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Results By Segment.” 

Underwriting gain (loss): The Hartford's management evaluates profitability of the Commercial and Personal Lines segments primarily on the basis of underwriting gain or loss. Underwriting gain (loss) is a before-tax measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting gain (loss) is influenced significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of The Hartford's pricing. Underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by The Hartford's underwriting discipline, as management strives to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, effective management of claims, use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expenses. The Hartford believes that the measure underwriting gain (loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability, before tax, derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the company's investing activities. A reconciliation of underwriting results to net income for the quarterly periods ended Dec. 31, 2014 and 2013, is set forth below.
