MINNEAPOLIS – January 28, 2015 – Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported fourth quarter 2014 net income(1) of $426 million, or $2.23 per diluted share. Operating earnings were $440 million, up 16 percent from a year ago, with operating earnings per diluted share increasing 23 percent to $2.30. 

Operating net revenues increased 5 percent to $3.0 billion driven by strong fee-based business growth from client net inflows and market appreciation. 

Operating expenses increased 5 percent to $2.4 billion reflecting higher distribution expense and higher benefits to policyholders in the insurance and annuities businesses. General and administrative expenses decreased 2 percent compared to a year ago reflecting the company’s ongoing expense discipline. 

On a full-year basis, the company generated strong operating results and revenue growth. Compared to 2013, operating net revenues grew 7 percent to $11.6 billion, operating earnings grew 14 percent to $1.7 billion, and operating earnings per diluted share increased 21 percent to $8.52. 

In the quarter, the company returned $444 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. For the full year, the company returned $1.8 billion to shareholders. 

“Ameriprise delivered another good quarter to complete a strong year, led by our Advice and Wealth Management business,” said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. “We’re bringing in significant client net inflows, growing our assets under management and increasing advisor productivity.” 

“Our operating return on equity for the year increased to 23.0 percent – another record high. With our excellent financial foundation and ability to generate significant free cash flow, Ameriprise continues to return a differentiated level of capital to shareholders. 2014 marked the fourth consecutive year when we’ve returned more than 100 percent of our operating earnings to shareholders.”

Fourth Quarter and Full Year Summary 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%. 

(2) The company believes the presentation of operating earnings best represents the economics of the business. Operating earnings, after-tax, exclude the consolidation of certain investment entities; net realized gains or losses; integration and restructuring charges; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits net of hedges and related deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC) amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization, and the reinsurance accrual; and income or loss from discontinued operations. 

Results in the quarter were strong and included a favorable $8 million pretax market impact on DAC and DSIC compared to a $17 million pretax benefit a year ago. Results also included a benefit from lower taxes that was largely offset by an increase in Auto and Home reserves and an actuarial model correction, both in the Protection segment. The net effect of these items was an unfavorable impact of $6 million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share. 

In addition, the results in the year ago quarter included a favorable $26 million pretax impact from variable annuity product changes. 

Taxes 

The fourth quarter 2014 operating effective tax rate was 20.3 percent compared to 27.2 percent a year ago. The 2014 full year operating effective tax rate was 25.4 percent. The lower tax rate reflects the impact of an increase in the dividends received deduction and lower state income taxes. These changes reduced taxes by approximately $32 million. The company estimates that its full year 2015 operating effective tax rate will be in the 26 to 28 percent range.

Fourth quarter adjusted net pretax operating margin remained strong at 40.0 percent compared to 38.8 percent a year ago. 

Operating net revenues grew 1 percent to $830 million primarily driven by asset growth from market appreciation, partially offset by the cumulative impact of net outflows.

Third party institutional inflows of $1.7 billion were primarily offset by former parent company related outflows at both Columbia and Threadneedle.

Account balances grew 2 percent to $77 billion driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.

 Protection Segment Operating Results

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

NM Not Meaningful — variance of greater than 100% 

Protection pretax operating earnings were $30 million compared to $74 million a year ago. Included in the current quarter’s results were a $60 million Auto and Home reserve increase and a $7 million actuarial model correction in Life and Health. Without these items, operating earnings would have been $97 million in the quarter. 

Life and Health earnings, without the actuarial model correction, were solid and reflect normal quarterly claims fluctuations. VUL/UL account balances grew 3 percent primarily from market appreciation. VUL/UL cash sales were $85 million, up 2 percent. 

Reserves in Auto and Home increased primarily related to higher claims frequency and severity levels in the auto product line. Improvements in underwriting, operational and claims processes, and pricing actions were taken in 2014 and will continue in 2015. The benefits of these actions are anticipated to be realized over the next several years. Auto and Home policy growth remains strong with home policies in force up 16 percent and auto policies up 7 percent.
