Certain of the matters discussed in this report about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including, without limitation, future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects, consequences and all other statements that are

adverse changes in energy industry law, policies and regulation, including market structures and a potential shift away from competitive markets toward subsidized market

in the future, and reliability standards,  

•  

any inability of our transmission and distribution businesses to obtain adequate and timely rate relief and regulatory approvals from federal and state regulators,  

•  

changes in federal and state environmental regulations and enforcement that could increase our costs or limit our operations,

could limit operations of our nuclear generating units,

•  

any inability to manage our energy obligations, available supply and risks,  

•  

adverse outcomes of any legal, regulatory or other proceeding, settlement, investigation or claim applicable to us and/or the energy industry,  

•  

any deterioration in our credit quality or the credit quality of our counterparties,  

•  

availability of capital and credit at commercially reasonable terms and conditions and our ability to meet cash needs,  

•  

changes in the cost of, or interruption in the supply of, fuel and other commodities necessary to the operation of our generating units,  

•  

delays in receipt of necessary permits and approvals for our construction and development activities,  

•  

delays or unforeseen cost escalations in our construction and development activities,  

•  

any inability to achieve, or continue to sustain, our expected levels of operating performance,  

•  

any equipment failures, accidents, severe weather events or other incidents that impact our ability to provide safe and reliable service to our customers, and any inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage or  

recover proceeds of insurance with respect to such events,  

•  

acts of terrorism, cybersecurity attacks or intrusions that could adversely impact our businesses,  

•  

increases in competition in energy supply markets as well as competition for certain transmission projects,  

•  

any inability to realize anticipated tax benefits or retain tax credits,  

•  

challenges associated with recruitment and/or retention of a qualified workforce,  

•  

adverse performance of our decommissioning and defined benefit plan trust fund investments and changes in funding requirements,  

•  

changes in technology, such as distributed generation and micro grids, and greater reliance on these technologies, and  

•  

changes in customer behaviors, including increases in energy efficiency, net-metering and demand response.  

All of the forward-looking statements made in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements and we cannot assure you that the results or developments anticipated by management will be realized or even if realized, 

will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, us or our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements in  

making any investment decision. Forward-looking statements made in this report apply only as of the date of this report. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements from time to time, we specifically disclaim  

any obligation to do so, even if internal estimates change, unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws.  

The forward-looking statements contained in this report are intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

GAAP Disclaimer

PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in  

accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  

(GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from  

Net Income because it excludes gains or losses associated with Nuclear  

Decommissioning Trust (NDT), Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting, and other  

material one-time items. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because  

management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results  

excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with  

GAAP. PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of Operating  

Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its  

businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends. This  

information is not 

intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information.  

The last slides in this presentation include a list of items excluded from Net  

Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings, with a reference to those slides  

included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.
