Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

"Earnings from ongoing operations," also referred to as "ongoing earnings," should not be considered as an alternative to reported earnings, or

 net income attributable to PPL shareowners, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with U.S. generally

 accepted accounting principles (GAAP). PPL believes that "earnings from ongoing operations," although a non-GAAP financial measure, is also

 useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's fundamental earnings performance as another criterion in

 making investment decisions. PPL's management also uses "earnings from ongoing operations" in measuring certain corporate performance

 goals. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance. 

"Earnings from ongoing operations" is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items include: 

• Adjusted energy-related economic activity (as discussed below). 

• Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency-related economic hedges. 

• Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business. 

• Impairment charges (including impairments of securities in the company's nuclear decommissioning trust funds). 

• Workforce reduction and other restructuring effects. 

• Acquisition and disposition-related adjustments. 

• Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, not reflective of the company's ongoing operations. 

Adjusted energy-related economic activity includes the changes in fair value of positions used to economically hedge a portion of the economic

 value of the competitive generation assets, full-requirement sales contracts and retail activities. This economic value is subject to changes in fair

 value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities (e.g., fuel and power) prior to the delivery period that was hedged.

 Adjusted energy-related economic activity also includes the ineffective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges, the monetization of certain full-

 requirement sales contracts and premium amortization associated with options. Unrealized gains and losses related to this activity are deferred,

 with the exception of the full-requirement sales contracts that were monetized, and included in earnings from ongoing operations over the

 delivery period of the item that was hedged or upon realization. Management believes that adjusting for such amounts provides a better matching

 of earnings from ongoing operations to the actual amounts settled for PPL's underlying hedged assets. Please refer to the Notes to the

 Consolidated Financial Statements and MD&A in PPL Corporation's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional

 information on adjusted energy-related economic activity. 

Free cash flow before dividends is derived by deducting capital expenditures, proceeds from the sale of certain assets and other investing

 activities-net, from cash flow from operations. Free cash flow before dividends should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from

 operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that free cash flow before dividends, although a non-GAAP measure, is

 an important measure to both management and investors, as it is an indicator of the company's ability to sustain operations and growth without

 additional outside financing beyond the requirement to fund maturing debt obligations. Other companies may calculate free cash flow before

 dividends in a different manner.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

PPL utilizes the following non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses. These measures are not intended to replace "Operating

 Income," which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to

 analyze and report their results of operations. Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. These

 performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage the operations, analyze

 actual results compared with budget and, in certain cases, to measure certain corporate financial goals used to determine variable compensation. 

"Kentucky Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the Kentucky Regulated segment's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's electricity generation,

 transmission and distribution operations as well as LKE's and LG&E's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases

 and certain variable costs of production (recorded as "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from revenues. In addition,

 certain other expenses, recorded as "Other operation and maintenance" and "Depreciation" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost

 recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these

 expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the

 electricity and gas operations. 

"Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's and PPL Electric's electricity

 delivery operations, which includes transmission and distribution activities. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved

 recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded

 in "Energy purchases," "Other operation and maintenance," which is primarily Act 129 costs, and "Taxes, other than income," which is primarily gross receipts

 tax. This performance measure includes PLR energy purchases by PPL Electric from PPL EnergyPlus, which are reflected in "PLR intersegment utility revenue

 (expense)." As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's and PPL Electric's electricity delivery operations. 

"Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the Supply segment's and PPL Energy Supply's competitive energy activities,

 which are managed on a geographic basis. In calculating this measure, energy revenues, including operating revenues associated with certain businesses

 classified as discontinued operations, are offset by the cost of fuel, energy purchases, certain other operation and maintenance expenses, primarily ancillary

 charges, gross receipts tax, recorded in "Taxes, other than income," and operating expenses associated with certain businesses classified as discontinued

 operations. This performance measure is relevant due to the volatility in the individual revenue and expense lines on the Statements of Income that comprise

 "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins." This volatility stems from a number of factors, including the required netting of certain transactions with ISOs and

 significant fluctuations in unrealized gains and losses. Such factors could result in gains or losses being recorded in either "Unregulated wholesale energy",

 "Unregulated retail energy" or "Energy purchases" on the Statements of Income. This performance measure includes PLR revenues from energy sales to PPL

 Electric by PPL EnergyPlus, which are reflected in "PLR intersegment utility revenue (expense)." "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" excludes adjusted

 energy-related economic activity, which includes the changes in fair value of positions used to economically hedge a portion of the economic value of the

 competitive generation assets, full-requirement sales contracts and retail activities. This economic value is subject to changes in fair value due to market price

 volatility of the input and output commodities (e.g., fuel and power) prior to the delivery period that was hedged. Adjusted energy-related economic activity

 includes the ineffective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges, the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts and premium amortization associated

 with options. Unrealized gains and losses related to this activity are deferred, with the exception of the full-requirement sales contracts that were monetized, and

 included in "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" over the delivery period that was hedged or upon realization.
