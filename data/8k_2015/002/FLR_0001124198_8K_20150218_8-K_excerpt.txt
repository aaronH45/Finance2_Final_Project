Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 

On February 18, 2015, Fluor Corporation (the “Company”) announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. A copy of the press release (the “Earnings Release”) making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. 

The Earnings Release contains a discussion of segment profit that would be deemed a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC rules. “Segment profit” is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding: corporate general and administrative expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; other non-operating income and expense items; and loss from discontinued operations. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides information that is useful to its investors regarding its financial performance and results of operations. 

The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liabilities of that section. Furthermore, this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

The Company includes backlog and new awards data in the Earnings Release. Backlog is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, and deferrals, as appropriate. New awards is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded in the period. Backlog and new awards measures are regularly reported in the construction industry.
