MADISON, N.J., JANUARY 29, 2015 - Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services, announced today that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014, adjusted income from continuing operations grew to $158 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, compared to $151 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for 2013. 

For the fourth quarter of 2014, reported income from continuing operations was $185 million, or $1.26 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2014 benefited from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies of $44 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. This benefit was partially offset by $17 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, of charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs and ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence. In the fourth quarter of 2013, reported income from continuing operations was $143 million, or $0.97 per diluted share.

Revenues from continuing operations were $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014, 7.2% higher than the prior year. Organic revenues from continuing operations increased for the fourth quarter by 0.6% compared to the prior year. Diagnostic information services revenues increased 7.1% compared to a year ago; volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 8.8% versus a year ago; and revenue per requisition was 1.5% lower than a year ago. Excluding acquisitions, revenue per requisition for diagnostic information services was essentially unchanged from a year ago.

For the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted operating income from continuing operations grew modestly to $283 million, or 15.0% of revenues, compared to $282 million, or 16.1% of revenues, for the fourth quarter of 2013. For the fourth quarter of 2014, reported operating income from continuing operations was $257 million, or 13.7% of revenues, compared to $270 million, or 15.3% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013. Cash provided by operations was $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

“We ended 2014 strong, and in the fourth quarter generated growth in revenues and EPS,” said Steve Rusckowski, President and CEO. “The 2015 outlook we are providing today is based on our expectations for strengthening operational performance and an improving business environment. Further, based on our ability to continue to generate strong cash flow, today we are announcing the fourth increase in our dividend since 2011.”

Outlook for Full Year 2015

At its November 5, 2014 Investor Day the company indicated it would begin to present adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense, which the company believes provides investors with better insight into its underlying operating performance. As a result, the company’s presentation of 2015 adjusted diluted EPS guidance described below excludes the impact of special items and amortization expense. For the full year 2014, adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense was $4.50. 

For 2015, the company estimates results from continuing operations, before special items as follows: 

•Revenues to increase approximately 2% to 3%, compared to 2014;

•Adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to be between $4.70 and $4.85;

•Cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million; and

•Capital expenditures to approximate $300 million

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures

As used in this press release, for the purpose of earnings the term “adjusted” refers to the operating performance measures that exclude the gain on sale of ibrutinib royalty rights, restructuring and integration charges, favorable resolution of tax contingencies, loss on sale of the Enterix business and other items. For 2015 guidance and the presentation of 2014 full year results, adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense represents the Company's results before the impact of special items and amortization expense. Adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

The attached tables include reconciliations of adjusted operating performance measures to measures reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Notes to Financial Tables

1)The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Earnings per common share are computed independently for each quarterly period. Therefore, the sum of quarterly earnings per common share may not equal earnings per common share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

2)Adjusted amounts for operating income, income from continuing operations attributable to Quest Diagnostics' stockholders, and diluted EPS represent the Company's results before the impact of the gain on sale of ibrutinib royalty rights, restructuring and integration charges, favorable resolution of tax contingencies, loss on sale of the Enterix business and other. Adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense represents the Company's results before the impact of special items and amortization expense. Adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States when comparing results of operations from period to period. Adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The following tables reconcile reported results to adjusted results:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Represents the gain, net of transaction costs, associated with the sale of the Company's ibrutinib royalty rights.

(b)Represents costs primarily associated with workforce reductions and professional fees incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business.

(c)For the three months ended December 31, 2014, represents a gain of $9 million associated with a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with the Summit Health acquisition, partially offset by costs incurred related to legal matters. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, represents costs incurred related to legal matters, partially offset by a gain of $9 million associated with a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with the Summit Health acquisition.

(d)For the gain on sale of ibrutinib royalty rights, income tax expense was calculated using a combined federal and state rate of 37.1%. For the restructuring and integration charges and other, income tax impacts, where recorded, were calculated using a combined federal and state rate of 38.2%. For the loss on sale of Enterix, income tax benefits were calculated using combined federal and state rates of 35.9%.

(e)Represents the impact of amortization expense, net of the estimated tax benefit, on diluted EPS. The income tax benefit was calculated using a combined federal and state rate of 38.2%. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4)Other operating (income) expense, net includes miscellaneous income and expense items related to operating activities. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, other operating (income) expense, net includes a gain of $9 million associated with a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with the Summit Health acquisition. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, other operating (income) expense, net includes the pre-tax loss on sale of Enterix of $40 million.

As a result, income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, includes a gain of $14 million (including foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by income tax expense and transaction costs) associated with the sale of HemoCue. In addition, income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, includes discrete tax benefits of $20 million associated with favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies related to our NID business, which was wound down in 2006.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

8)The outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense represents management’s estimates for the full year 2015 before the impact of special items and amortization expense. This measure is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to the corresponding amount determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is meaningful to evaluate the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding amount determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The following table reconciles our 2015 outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to the corresponding amount determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
