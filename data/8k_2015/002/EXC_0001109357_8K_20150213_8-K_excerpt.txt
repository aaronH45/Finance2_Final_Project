Section 8 – Other Events  

 Item 8.01 Other Events.  

As previously disclosed, on April 29, 2014, Exelon Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (“Exelon”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Original Merger Agreement”) by and among Exelon, Purple Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon (“Merger Sub”), and Pepco Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PHI”). The Original Merger Agreement was amended and restated by the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 18, 2014, among Exelon, Merger Sub and PHI.  

On February 13, 2015, Exelon, PHI, Delmarva Power & Light Company, the staff of the Delaware Public Service Commission (PSC), the Delaware Public Advocate, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility, the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition and the Clean Air Council filed with the PSC a settlement agreement (Settlement). The Settlement is subject to approval by the Commissioners of the PSC. A copy of the joint press release concerning the Settlement issued by Exelon and PHI is attached as Exhibit 99.1. A copy of the Settlement is available at www.phitomorrow.com.  

The proposed merger also remains subject to approval by the public service commissions of the District of Columbia and Maryland. Following the expiration of the U.S. Department of Justice’s review period on December 22, 2014, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act no longer precludes completion of the merger. Exelon and PHI continue to expect to complete the merger in the second or third quarter of 2015.
