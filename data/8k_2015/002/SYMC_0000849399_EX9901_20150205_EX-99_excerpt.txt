MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – February 5, 2015 – Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) today reported the results of its third quarter of fiscal year 2015, ended January 2, 2015. 

Michael A. Brown, president and CEO, said, “Cyberattacks continue to dominate the headlines with more than 70 percent of these still occurring at the endpoint. By harnessing Symantec’s vast threat telemetry to deliver actionable insight, we continue to prevent attacks at hundreds of millions of enterprise and consumer endpoints.” 

“As the market leader in endpoint security, our enterprise endpoint protection revenue grew 5 percent year-over-year in constant currency. Over the next few quarters, we will deliver more powerful advanced threat protection capabilities that will better detect and remediate attacks.” 

“Our information management business, recently rebranded as Veritas, is experiencing accelerating growth, driven by double-digit revenue growth for both our NetBackup appliances and NetBackup software.” 

Thomas Seifert, executive vice president and CFO, said, “Driving operational efficiencies across the company has allowed us to achieve our 30 percent operating margin target. We saw implied billings growth for three consecutive quarters on a constant currency basis, in addition to a 21 percent increase in large deals, underlining that the momentum in our businesses is strong.”

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Our results of operations have undergone significant change due to the impact of stock-based compensation, charges related to the amortization of intangible assets, and certain other income and expense items that management considers unrelated to the Company’s core operations, including restructuring, separation and transition costs. To help our readers understand our past financial performance and our future results, we supplement the financial results that we provide in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. The method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not computed according to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is attached to our quarterly earnings release and which can be found, along with other financial information, on the investor relations page of our website at http://www.symantec.com/invest.

Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Other Items 

Appendix A

Segment Reporting: In fiscal 2015, we are focused on managing our businesses as a portfolio and optimizing certain businesses for margin or growth. As a result, we formed a new consumer group and we consolidated our enterprise security businesses into a segment. We modified our segment reporting structure to match our operating structure in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The historical periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the new reporting structure, which is now: 

● Consumer Security 

● Enterprise Security 

● Information Management

Consumer Security consists of our consumer security businesses that were previously reported in User Productivity & Protection. Enterprise Security consists of our enterprise security businesses that were previously reported in User Productivity & Protection and Information Security. There were no changes to the Information Management segment.

Objective of non-GAAP measures: We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operating performance for the reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of the Company’s performance to prior periods and to our peers and that investors benefit from an understanding of the non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.

Change in non-GAAP methodology: From time to time, the Company performs a comprehensive review of its non-GAAP financial measures. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items: stock-based compensation expense; charges related to the amortization of intangible assets; certain other income and expense items that management considers unrelated to the Company’s core operations; and the associated income tax effects of the adjustments. By limiting the number and nature of adjustments, our management team believes this supplemental information will provide more meaningful insight into the performance of the Company’s core business and enhance investors’ ability to compare the Company’s performance to its peers. The adoption of the change in methodology has been applied retrospectively to prior periods to facilitate comparability across periods.

Stock-based compensation: Consists of expenses for employee stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, performance based awards and our employee stock purchase plan determined in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock-based compensation. When evaluating the performance of our individual business units and developing short- and long-term plans, we do not consider stock-based compensation charges. Our management team is held accountable for cash-based compensation, but we believe that management is limited in its ability to project the impact of stock-based compensation and accordingly is not held accountable for its impact on our operating results. Although stock-based compensation is necessary to attract and retain quality employees, our consideration of stock-based compensation places its primary emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants. In addition, for comparability purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate the comparison of our results to the results of our peer companies. Furthermore, unlike cash-based compensation, the value of stock-based compensation is determined using complex formulas that incorporate factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

Amortization of intangible assets: When conducting internal development of intangible assets, accounting rules require that we expense the costs as incurred. In the case of acquired businesses, however, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges from our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre- and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets. 

Restructuring, separation, and transition: We have engaged in various restructuring, separation, and transition activities over the past several years that have resulted in costs associated with severance, facilities, transition, and other related costs. Separation and other related costs consist of consulting and disentanglement costs incurred to split the Company into two, independent publicly traded companies, as well as costs to prune selected product lines that do not fit either the Company’s growth or margin objectives. Transition and other related costs consist of consulting charges associated with the implementation of new Enterprise Resource Planning systems. Each restructuring, separation, and transition activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring, separation, or transition activities in the ordinary course of business. While our operations previously benefited from the employees and facilities covered by our various restructuring and separation charges, these employees and facilities have benefited different parts of our business in different ways, and the amount of these charges has varied significantly from period to period. We believe that it is important to understand these charges and we believe that investors benefit from excluding these charges from our operating results to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance.
