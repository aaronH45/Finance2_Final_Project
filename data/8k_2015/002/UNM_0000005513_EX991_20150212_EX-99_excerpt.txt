Unum Group Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe the following non-GAAP financial measures are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business:

•Operating revenue, which excludes realized investment gains or losses;

•Before-tax operating income or loss, which excludes realized investment gains or losses, non-operating retirement-related gains or losses, income tax, and certain other items, as applicable, and after-tax operating income or loss which includes income tax; 

•Operating return on equity, which is calculated using after-tax operating income or loss and excludes from equity the unrealized gain or loss on securities and net gain on cash flow hedges;

•Leverage ratio, which excludes the unrealized gain or loss on securities and net gain on cash flow hedges, and the non-recourse debt and associated capital of Tailwind Holdings, LLC and Northwind Holdings, LLC; and

•Book value per common share, which is calculated excluding AOCI.

Realized investment gains or losses, non-operating retirement-related gains or losses, unrealized gains or losses on securities and net gains on cash flow hedges depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our Company. Leverage ratio and book value per common share excluding certain components of AOCI, certain of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures. We also exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace the comparable GAAP measures in the determination of overall profitability. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" beginning on page 9.1.
