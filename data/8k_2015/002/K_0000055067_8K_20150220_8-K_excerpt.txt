The Compensation Committee of the Board approved the 2015-2017 Executive Performance Plan (“2015-2017 EPP”) under which certain senior executives would be eligible to receive a portion of their long-term incentives in the form of performance shares based on the achievement of cash flow and relative total shareowner return targets. Awards are paid in shares at the end of the performance period, except for amounts withheld by the Company for minimum statutory withholding requirements. In addition, the independent members of the Board granted 2015-2017 EPP target awards of 57,100 shares for John Bryant; 16,700 shares for Paul Norman; 13,600 shares for Ron Dissinger; 10,400 shares for Gary Pilnick; and 8,800 shares for Alistair Hirst. Participants in the 2015-2017 EPP have the opportunity to earn between 0% and 200% of their EPP target. Dividends are not paid on unvested EPP awards. A copy of the 2015-2017 EPP is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated in its entirety into this Item.
