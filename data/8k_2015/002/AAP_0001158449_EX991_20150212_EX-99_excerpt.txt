(2) Consistent with its comparable store sales policy, the Company did not include the sales from General Parts in its comparable store sales results in 2014.

“I would like to thank all our Team Members for their hard work during the fourth quarter and the 2014 fiscal year,” said Darren R. Jackson, Chief Executive Officer. “Our organizational focus delivered on our base business outcomes with record operating profits and full year Comparable Cash EPS of $7.59 while successfully achieving the first full year of integration deliverables. We look forward to 2015 with optimism as we continue the integration of General Parts and build on our performance from 2014.”

Fourth Quarter 2014 Highlights

On a comparable basis, total sales for the fourth quarter increased 48.1% to $2.09 billion, as compared with total sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 of $1.41 billion. The sales increase was driven by the acquisition of General Parts, a comparable store sales increase of 1.1% and the addition of new stores over the past 12 months. On a GAAP basis, total sales for the fourth quarter increased 58.8% to $2.24 billion, as compared with total sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 of $1.41 billion. On a comparable basis, total sales increased 49.3% to $9.69 billion for fiscal 2014, compared with total sales of $6.49 billion over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, total sales increased 51.6% to $9.84 billion for fiscal 2014, compared with total sales of $6.49 billion over the same period last year.

The Company's Comparable Gross Profit rate was 44.9% of sales during the fourth quarter as compared to 49.8% during the fourth quarter last year. The 495 basis-point decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to the higher mix of commercial sales which has a lower gross margin rate resulting from the acquisition of General Parts partially offset by acquisition synergy savings in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, the Company's gross profit rate was 44.9% of sales during the fourth quarter as compared to 49.8% during the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2014, the Company's comparable gross profit rate was 45.2%, a 484 basis-point decrease over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, the Company's comparable gross profit rate was 45.2% for fiscal 2014, a 484 basis-point decrease over the same period last year.

The Company's Comparable SG&A rate was 36.6% of sales during the fourth quarter as compared to 41.7% during the same period last year. The 510 basis-point decrease was primarily the result of the acquired General Parts business having lower SG&A costs combined with lower incentive compensation expenses. On a GAAP basis, the Company's SG&A rate was 38.3% of sales during the fourth quarter as compared to 43.4% during the same period last year. For fiscal 2014, the Company's Comparable SG&A rate was 35.4% versus 39.4% during fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, the Company's GAAP SG&A rate was 36.6% versus 39.9% during fiscal 2013.

The Company's Comparable Operating Income was $171.7 million during the fourth quarter, an increase of 50.8% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. As a percentage of sales, Comparable Operating Income in the fourth quarter was 8.2% compared to 8.1% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. On a GAAP basis, the Company's operating income during the fourth quarter of $146.1 million increased 60.8% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. On a GAAP basis, the Operating Income rate was 6.5% during the fourth quarter as compared to 6.4% during the 

fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, the Company's Comparable Operating Income rate was 9.9% versus 10.7% during fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, the Company's GAAP Operating Income rate was 8.7% versus 10.2% during fiscal 2013. 

Operating cash flow increased approximately 30.0% to $709.0 million in fiscal 2014 from $545.3 million in fiscal 2013. Free cash flow increased to $480.5 million in fiscal 2014 from $349.5 million in fiscal 2013. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 were $228.4 million as compared to $195.8 million for fiscal 2013.

 “In our first year as a combined company, we are pleased with our overall performance delivering positive comparable store sales, strong growth in free cash flow and approximately 38% growth in Comparable Operating Income dollars in fiscal 2014,” said Mike Norona, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “The strength of our commercial business combined with achievement of our targeted synergies and continued disciplined focus on expense management throughout the year allowed us to increase our fiscal 2014 comparable earnings per share 33.9% over last year.”

Store Information

As of January 3, 2015, the Company operated 5,261 stores and 111 Worldpac branches and served approximately 1,325 independently-owned Carquest stores.

2015 Annual Financial Outlook Key Assumptions

Fiscal 2015 financial outlook and certain key assumptions provided below are on a 52-week basis versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2014. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Advance calculates comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been open for 13 complete accounting periods (approximately one year) and by including e-commerce sales. We include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening. Acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales once the stores have completed 13 complete accounting periods after the acquisition date (approximately one year). Accordingly, the previously acquired GPI stores and branches will be included in 2015 comparable store sales beginning with our second fiscal period of 2015. Sales to independently-owned CarQuest locations will not be included in comparable store sales. The 2015 comparable store sales estimates include the impact of store consolidations. 

(2) Comparable Cash EPS is defined as Cash EPS in addition to the exclusion of other non-comparable items, including one-time expenses to achieve synergies related to the GPI acquisition and integration costs associated with the integration of BWP. Cash EPS is EPS excluding the amortization of GPI's intangible assets. Both Comparable Cash EPS and Cash EPS are non-GAAP measures. Because of the forward-looking nature of these non-GAAP financial measures, specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are not available at this time. Management believes Comparable Cash EPS is an important measure in assessing the overall performance of the business and utilizes this metric in its ongoing reporting. On that basis, Management believes it is useful to provide Comparable Cash EPS to investors and prospective investors. Comparable Cash EPS and Cash EPS might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

(3) Total net run rate cost synergies related to the acquisition of GPI are estimated to be $160 million by approximately the end of the third year following the close of the acquisition. These net synergies will be driven primarily through the areas of procurement as well as corporate, store and supply chain efficiencies.

(4)The estimated tax rate for fiscal 2015 is higher than fiscal 2014 due to specific favorable items in 2014 that we do not expect to reoccur in 2015.

(5) Total one-time expenses to achieve synergies related to the acquisition of GPI are estimated to be approximately $190 million over a five year period following the close of the acquisition with the majority of the costs being incurred within the first three years. 

(6) The capital expenditures estimate includes integration capital for 2015.

“Our 2015 annual comparable cash EPS outlook will be in the range of $8.35 to $8.55," said Mike Norona, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “We will continue to build on our 2014 progress and leverage the size and scale of our company as we focus on continued sales growth, serving our customers and improving our operating profit in 2015.” 

Dividend

On February 11, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per 

share to be paid on April 3, 2015 to stockholders of record as of March 20, 2015.

NOTE: Management uses free cash flow as a measure of our liquidity and believes it is a useful indicator to stockholders of our ability to implement our growth strategies and service our debt.

NOTE: Management believes its Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR ratio (“leverage ratio”) is a key financial metric and believes its debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. The Company’s goal is to quickly pay down debt resulting from the GPI acquisition, get back to a 2.5 times leverage ratio and to maintain an investment grade rating. The leverage ratio calculated by the Company is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a substitute for debt to net earnings, net earnings or debt as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s calculation of its leverage ratio might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.

(a) These financial measures for the thirteen and fifty-three weeks ended January 3, 2015 have been reported on a GAAP basis which includes the impact of a 53rd week of operations, BWP integration costs of $0.8 million and $9.0 million, respectively, General Parts integration costs of $36.0 million and $73.2 million, respectively, and General Parts amortization of acquired intangible assets of $9.9 million and $42.7 million, respectively.

Included in the transaction costs in each period presented is $2.0 million that is classified as interest expense. These financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial measures presented on a comparable basis earlier in this press release. Management believes the reporting of financial results on a non-GAAP basis to remain comparable is important in assessing the overall performance of the business and is therefore useful for investors and prospective investors.
