Annual sales totaled $23.6 billion in 2014 compared with $23.5 billion in 2013. Quarterly net sales were $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $5.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.

“International Paper delivered record cash from operations through strong performance by the North American Industrial Packaging group,” said Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "As we enter 2015, a strengthening North American economy is helping to offset a global environment that remains challenged. With our focus on execution, IP expects to deliver another year of earnings growth and strong free cash flow.”

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The performance of the Company’s business segments are measured quarter to quarter without variations caused by special items, as management focuses on business segment operating profits excluding those items. Fourth quarter 2014 business segment operating profits and business trends compared with the prior quarter are as follows:

Industrial Packaging operating profits in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $484 million ($379 million including special items) compared with $569 million ($527 million including special items) in the third quarter of 2014. The earnings decrease was largely due to higher planned maintenance outage expenses, lower export prices and higher operating expenses. North America's box business ended the quarter with the strongest seasonal demand since 2010. 

Printing Papers operating profits were $155 million ($148 million including special items) in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus $192 million ($177 million including special items) in the third quarter of 2014. In the U.S., the earnings decrease was primarily driven by higher annual maintenance outage expenses for paper, while pulp earnings benefited from fewer annual maintenance outages. In Brazil, volume and mix improved quarter over quarter reflecting seasonal improvements, but were more than offset by higher operating and maintenance outage expenses. In Europe, despite challenging market conditions, volumes were higher. Europe's results were additionally impacted by higher costs. 

Consumer Packaging operating profits were $55 million ($51 million including special items) in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $79 million ($77 million including special items) in the third quarter of 2014. North American coated paperboard earnings decreased due to lower sales volume and higher planned annual maintenance spending, which was partially offset by improved input costs. Revenue and volume for IP's foodservice business were at record levels. 

International Paper recorded an Ilim joint venture equity loss of $136 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with an equity loss of $70 million in the third quarter of 2014. With respect to Ilim’s U.S. dollar denominated net debt, the Company recognized a non-cash after-tax foreign exchange loss of $171 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 ($0.40 per share), compared with an after-tax loss of $82 million in the third quarter of 2014, largely due to foreign exchange movement in the U.S. dollar versus the Russian ruble. Operating earnings improved quarter over quarter, reflecting higher sales volumes, strong operations and margin expansion.

CORPORATE EXPENSES

Net corporate expenses, excluding non-operating pension expense, for the 2014 fourth quarter were $35 million compared with $3 million in the third quarter of 2014. Corporate expenses reflect $21 million for a non-cash foreign exchange charge related to administrative restructuring of some international entities. 

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

The effective tax rate before special items and non-operating pension expense for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 30.5%, compared with an effective tax rate of 30.5% in the third quarter of 2014. The 2014 full year rate was 31% compared with 26% for the 2013 full year.

(1)The Company calculates Operating Earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of non-operating pension expense and items considered by management to be unusual from the earnings reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. International Paper believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations by quarter. Net earnings is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
