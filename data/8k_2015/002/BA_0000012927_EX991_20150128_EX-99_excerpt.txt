“Strong operating performance in the final quarter of 2014 propelled us to some of our best-ever results and sealed a fifth consecutive year of core operating earnings growth. By responding to strong demand with market-leading and proven products and capabilities, and delivering them more efficiently, we are strengthening a powerful business platform that is providing increased returns for our shareholders,” said Boeing Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney.

“Our Commercial Airplanes business successfully increased production rates and set an industry record for annual deliveries while also growing its backlog to new highs on record new orders for the year. Our Defense, Space & Security team navigated a challenging market environment to achieve solid revenue and healthy margins while also winning significant new contracts,” said McNerney.

“For 2015, we will continue to build on our commercial airplanes market leadership, strengthening and repositioning our defense, space and security business and working to better meet the needs of our customers by focusing on improving productivity, executing to development plans and delivering our industry-leading portfolio of innovative aerospace products and services.”

Additional Financial Information

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total pension expense for the fourth quarter was $772 million, up from $717 million in the same period of the prior year. The company's income tax expense was $464 million in the quarter, compared to $201 million in the same period of the prior year primarily due to higher earnings.

Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided: 

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share 

Core operating earnings is defined as GAAP earnings from operations excluding unallocated pension and post-retirement expense. Core operating margin is defined as core operating earnings expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings per share is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding the net earnings per share impact of unallocated pension and post-retirement expense. Unallocated pension and post-retirement expense represents the portion of pension and other post-retirement costs that are not recognized by business segments for segment reporting purposes. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude unallocated pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided on page 14. 

Operating Cash Flow Before Pension Contributions 

Operating cash flow before pension contributions is defined as GAAP operating cash flow without pension contributions. Management believes operating cash flow before pension contributions provides additional insights into underlying business performance. Management uses operating cash flow before pension contributions as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Table 2 provides a reconciliation between GAAP operating cash flow and operating cash flow before pension contributions. 

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is defined as GAAP operating cash flow without capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment additions. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Table 2 provides a reconciliation between GAAP operating cash flow and free cash flow.
