(e) On January 15, 2015, Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) entered into an employment agreement (the “Agreement”) with Philippe P.

Mr. Dauman’s annual salary remains $4,000,000; Mr. Dauman’s target for his annual cash bonus under Viacom’s Senior Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan remains $20,000,000; and his annual equity awards are unchanged, and he will continue to receive an annual grant of performance share units (“PSUs”) with a value equal to $7,500,000 on January 1 of each year and an annual grant of stock options with a Black-Scholes value equal to $7,500,000 on the same day that the Compensation Committee of the Viacom Board of Directors makes its annual grant of equity awards to employees generally. The terms of the PSUs and stock options are consistent with prior grants.

In addition, on January 15, 2015, Mr. Dauman received a grant of 300,000 performance restricted share units (“PRSUs”) that will vest in three equal installments beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016. As with prior PRSU awards, such awards will deliver, at the time of vesting, 75% to 125% of the shares underlying the PRSUs, depending on the achievement of company financial targets over specified periods.

The foregoing summary of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Agreement, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to Viacom’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2014.
