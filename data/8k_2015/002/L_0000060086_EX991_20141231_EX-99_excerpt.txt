Three Months Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to 2013 

Income from continuing operations decreased primarily due to a decline in parent company investment income attributable to equity and limited partnership investments. 

CNA’s earnings were impacted by a $49 million charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to a lump sum pension plan settlement. Results were also unfavorably impacted by lower net investment income, driven by limited partnerships. These decreases were offset by improved current accident year underwriting results, lower catastrophe losses, increased favorable net prior year development, and the prior year impact of a $111 million charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to retroactive reinsurance accounting for the Loss Portfolio Transfer (LPT) transaction. 

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.’s earnings improved primarily due to the absence of a prior year tax provision of $27 million (after noncontrolling interests) for an uncertain tax position related to its Egyptian operations almost wholly offset by lower rig utilization and increased depreciation expense. 

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP’s earnings increase stemmed from the impact in 2013 of a goodwill charge of $16 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests). Absent this charge, earnings decreased primarily due to higher maintenance costs and expenses related to the Evangeline ethylene pipeline system acquired in October of 2014. 

Loews Hotels’ earnings increased primarily due to higher equity earnings from joint venture properties as a result of improved performance of the Universal Orlando properties. 

Discontinued operations in 2013 included the following charges at HighMount: an impairment charge of $22 million (after tax) related to gathering pipelines; a ceiling test impairment charge of $52 million (after tax); and a goodwill impairment charge of $382 million (after tax). 

Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to 2013 

Income from continuing operations decreased primarily due to lower earnings at CNA, Diamond Offshore and Boardwalk Pipeline. 

CNA’s earnings declined due to lower net investment income as a result of reduced limited partnership income and lower favorable net prior year development, as well as a $31 million loss (after tax and noncontrolling interests) on a coinsurance transaction related to the August 1, 2014 sale of CNA’s annuity and pension deposit business. These decreases were partially offset by improved current accident year underwriting results, lower catastrophe losses, and the prior year impact of the LPT charge as discussed above. 

Diamond Offshore’s earnings decreased primarily due to lower utilization, an impairment loss of $55 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the carrying value of six semisubmersible rigs, and higher depreciation and interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by the prior year tax provision discussed above. 

Boardwalk Pipeline’s earnings decreased primarily due to a $55 million charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the write-off of all previously capitalized costs incurred by the Company and Boardwalk Pipeline for the proposed Bluegrass project, as well as higher operations, maintenance and depreciation expense in 2014. The prior year included a goodwill impairment charge of $16 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) partially offset by a gain on the sale of storage gas of $13 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests).

Discontinued operations in 2014 include impairment charges related to the sale of HighMount and CNA’s annuity and pension deposit business as well as the operations of those businesses. Additionally, discontinued operations in 2013 included a ceiling test impairment charge of $186 million (after tax) and the goodwill impairment charge at HighMount as discussed above.
