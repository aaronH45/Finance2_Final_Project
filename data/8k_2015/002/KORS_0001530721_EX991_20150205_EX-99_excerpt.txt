John D. Idol, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our third quarter marked the 13th consecutive period of growth in revenue, comparable store sales and earnings, since our initial public offering. We had a strong holiday season, with comparable stores sales performance led by double digit growth in our accessories category, both in our retail and wholesale channels. We also saw continued momentum across our operating segments and geographies driven by our compelling fashion product offering and jet-set luxury experience that resonated well with customers. In addition, we continued to advance on our multiple growth strategies and in particular, we saw exceptional  

 performance from our recently launched Company-owned U.S. e-commerce site, which exceeded our expectations. E-commerce sales increased 73% in the quarter, as compared to sales at the previous outsourced site. Had we included e-commerce in our comparable store base, North America comparable store sales results would have been 380 basis points higher, which we believe is a more accurate reflection of our performance. It is clear that Michael Kors remains a leader within the global fashion luxury market and our brand continues to resonate with consumers around the world. Overall, we see continued momentum in our business, remain confident in our long-term potential and are committed to enhancing value for our shareholders.”
