Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On February 12, 2015, each of Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation (“Lennar”), and Richard Beckwitt, President of Lennar, entered into Time Sharing Agreements (the “Agreements”) with U.S. Home Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar (the “Company”), relating to the use by Mr. Miller and Mr. Beckwitt of private aircraft, which are operated by the Company. The Agreements replace the Time Sharing Agreements that Mr. Miller and Mr. Beckwitt had previously entered into in August 2005 and January 2011, respectively.  

The Agreements state that the Company may provide the aircraft and their flight crews to Mr. Miller and Mr. Beckwitt for non-business or personal business purposes. Under the Agreements, Mr. Miller and Mr. Beckwitt will pay to the Company, out of prepayment funds established by each of them in connection with the Agreements, the direct operating costs of each flight based on a list of expenses authorized by federal aviation regulations. The Company retains sole discretion to determine what flights may be scheduled, and the Company’s prior planned use of the aircraft will take precedence over Mr. Miller’s or Mr. Beckwitt’s non-business or personal business use.  

On February 12, 2015, Lennar Aircraft I, LLC, of which Lennar is the sole member, entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Aircraft Dry Lease Agreement (the “Lease Agreement”), dated as of December 1, 2008, between Lennar Aircraft I, LLC and the Company, to which Mr. Miller had been an additional party with the option to pay sums due from the Company. The Amendment removes Mr. Miller as a party to the Lease Agreement.  

The description of the terms of the Agreements and the Amendment are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete terms of the Agreements and the Amendment, which are filed as exhibits to this Report on Form 8-K.  

Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
