Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure.

On February 12, 2015, Unum Group (the “Company”) made available a Supplemental Exhibit to illustrate the anticipated changes to the presentation of the Company's prior period financial results as a result of the retrospective adoption, effective January 1, 2015, of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-01.

In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2014-01) to amend Accounting Standards Codification 323 "Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures" permitting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). The Company elected to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2015 and applied the amendments retrospectively, adjusting all prior periods.

This information is being made available to provide investors with an opportunity to become familiar with the expected impact of the accounting standards update to the Company's financial results and the presentation thereof prior to the Company's earnings release for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. A copy of the Supplemental Exhibit is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
