KEY FINANCIAL RESULTS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Non-GAAP financial information excludes after-tax charges of approximately $5.27 per diluted share related to share-based compensation and highlighted items. Details on these non-GAAP adjustments and the use of non-GAAP measures are included later in this news release.  

OTHER SELECTED FOURTH-QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  

   •   Revenue – Fourth-quarter sales were flat, including $27 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily reflecting growth in North America. Fourth-quarter Product sales grew 3 percent driven primarily by an improvement in devices, while Services declined 5 percent driven by lower iDEN and system integration sales.  

   •   Operating margin – Fourth-quarter GAAP operating margin was -80 percent of sales. GAAP operating earnings were impacted by a $1.9 billion non-recurring charge related to the U.S. pension de-risking activity. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.5 percent of sales reflecting $86 million in lower operating expenses compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to staff reductions across all functions and lower pension and variable compensation expense.  

   •   Taxes – The fourth-quarter 2014 GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations resulted in a benefit of 38 percent, driven by the loss from continuing operations, as well as other benefits recorded throughout the year. The fourth quarter 2014 non-GAAP tax rate from continuing operations was 35 percent. This compares with a negative GAAP effective tax rate of 7 percent and a non-GAAP tax rate of 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the fourth quarter of 2013 include the favorable impact of $113 million or $0.42 per share of net tax benefits associated with the recognition of certain foreign tax credits as a result of the implementation of a holding company structure for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.  

   •   Cash flow – The company used $700 million in operating cash from continuing operations during the quarter largely driven by incremental pension contributions of $846 million.  

   •   Cash and cash equivalents – The company completed the sale of its Enterprise business to Zebra Technologies for $3.45 billion and ended the year with total cash of $4 billion. The company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends during the quarter and $2.9 billion for the full year.  

OTHER SELECTED FULL-YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS  

   •   Revenue – Full-year sales declined 6 percent to $5.9 billion. The decrease in sales reflects a $302 million, or 7 percent, decrease in the Products segment driven by first-half declines in North America and lower Asia Pacific results.  

   •   Operating margin – For the full year, GAAP operating margin was -17.1 percent of sales, driven by a $1.9 billion non-recurring charge related to the U.S. pension de-risking activities. Non-GAAP operating margin was 18.2 percent of sales, driven by $208 million in operating expense reductions for the full year. Pension expense and variable compensation were lower compared to the previous year.  

   •   Taxes – The 2014 non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations was 32 percent, compared with a non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations of 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. The 2013 GAAP and non-GAAP full-year tax rates include the favorable impact of $337 million or $1.25 per share of net tax benefits associated with the recognition of certain foreign tax credits as a result of the implementation of a holding company structure for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.  

   •   Cash flow – The company used $685 million in operating cash from continuing operations during the year largely driven by pension contributions of $1.3 billion.

CONSOLIDATED GAAP RESULTS  

A comparison of results from operations is as follows:

HIGHLIGHTED ITEMS AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  

The table below includes highlighted items and share-based compensation expense for the fourth quarter of 2014.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

In addition to the GAAP results included in this presentation, Motorola Solutions also has included non-GAAP measurements of results. The company has provided these non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period to period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to its competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate performance of the businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes this measurement enables it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  

Highlighted items: The company has excluded the effects of highlighted items (and any reversals of highlighted items recorded in prior periods) from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements because the company believes that these historical items do not reflect expected future operating earnings or expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company’s current operating performance or comparisons to the company’s past operating performance.  

Share-based compensation expense: The company has excluded share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the company’s employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding share-based compensation expense primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Share-based compensation expense will recur in future periods.  

Details of the above items and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this press release.
