GAP INC. REPORTS JANUARY AND FOURTH QUARTER SALES RESULTS

Grows Fourth Quarter Net Sales 5 Percent on a Constant Currency Basis; 

Increases Full-Year Earnings per Share Guidance Range to $2.86 to $2.87

SAN FRANCISCO - February 9, 2015 - Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today reported that net sales for the four-week period ended January 31, 2015 were $888 million compared with net sales of $899 million for the four-week period ended February 1, 2014. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, Gap Inc.’s net sales increased 3 percent to $4.71 billion compared with $4.58 billion for the fourth quarter last year. 

On a constant currency basis, Gap Inc. net sales increased 5 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. In calculating net sales growth on a constant currency basis, current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year net sales. This is done to enhance the visibility of underlying business trends, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

“We’re pleased to have grown comparable sales 2 percent for the fourth quarter, driven by a strong, double-digit comp at Old Navy,” said Sabrina Simmons, chief financial officer, Gap Inc.

Fourth Quarter Guidance

The company raised its fiscal year 2014 diluted earnings per share guidance range to $2.86 to $2.87, driven by its fourth quarter results, as well as a lower effective tax rate. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, the company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.74. 

Gap Inc. now expects a fiscal 2014 full-year effective tax rate of about 37.3 percent, which is below the company’s previous guidance of about 38 percent, primarily driven by the retroactive extension in December 2014 of certain tax benefits.
