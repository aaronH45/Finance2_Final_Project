Core EPS were $0.88 for the quarter. Core EPS were $3.65 for the year, up 14%.

Plano, TX, Feb. 12, 2015 - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (NYSE: DPS) reported fourth quarter 2014 EPS of $0.77 compared to $0.78 in the prior year period. Core EPS were $0.88 compared to $0.97 in the prior year. 

For the quarter, reported net sales increased 3% on a 2% increase in sales volumes and favorable product, package and segment mix, which were partially offset by 1 percentage point of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Reported segment operating profit (SOP) increased 11%, or $38 million, on net sales growth and ongoing productivity improvements, as well as a favorable comparison to a $56 million non-cash charge due to our withdrawal last year from a multi-employer pension plan. These increases in year-over-year SOP were partially offset by increases in certain operating costs, including health and welfare and performance-based incentive compensation costs, a $13 million increase in marketing investments and an $8 million unfavorable foreign currency impact. Reported income from operations for the quarter was $256 million, including a $23 million unrealized commodity mark-to-market loss and a $14 million charge due to the annuitization of certain pension obligations. Reported income from operations was $264 million in the prior year period, which included the aforementioned $56 million pension charge and a $3 million unrealized commodity mark-to-market loss.

For the year, reported net sales increased 2%. Reported income from operations was $1,180 million, including the aforementioned $14 million pension charge and a $13 million unrealized commodity mark-to-market loss. Reported income from operations in the prior year was $1,046 million, which included the aforementioned $56 million pension charge and a $16 million unrealized commodity mark-to-market loss. Core income from operations was $1,205 million, up 7% compared to the prior year period. For the year, the company reported earnings of $3.56 per diluted share compared to $3.05 per diluted share in the prior year period. Core EPS were $3.65 compared to $3.20 in the prior year period.

DPS President and CEO Larry Young said, “In looking back at our performance in 2014, there’s no question that our teams continued to deliver against our focused strategy in a competitive environment. We continued to build our brands with relevant consumer messaging and programming, delivered innovation to meet consumers’ evolving needs and drove distribution and availability gains across the portfolio. Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) is helping us to drive growth and productivity across the business, and we’ve continued to return excess cash to our shareholders. I’m confident that we have the plans in place for 2015 to drive further improvement.”

In CSDs, Peñafiel volume increased 17% on product innovation. Our Core 4 brands grew 3% driven by a high-single-digit increase in Canada Dry and low-single-digit increases on Sunkist soda and A&W, which were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in 7UP. Schweppes increased 10%, and Crush declined mid-single-digits. Dr Pepper volume was flat, and fountain foodservice volume grew 2% for the quarter.

2

In NCBs, Snapple grew 4% for the quarter, driven primarily by mid-single-digit growth in Snapple Premium, which was partially offset by our de-emphasis on our value products.

By geography, U.S. and Canada volume increased 2%, and Mexico and the Caribbean volume increased 1%.

Beverage Concentrates

Net sales for the quarter decreased 2% as higher sales volumes and concentrate price increases taken earlier in the year were more than offset by a higher fourth quarter trade accrual. SOP for the quarter declined 7% on the net sales decline, increased marketing investments of $8 million and increases in certain operating costs, including performance-based incentive compensation costs.

Packaged Beverages

Net sales for the quarter increased 4% on higher sales volumes. SOP increased 50%, as last year’s SOP included a $56 million non-cash charge for our withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan. Positive contributions from net sales growth and ongoing productivity improvements in the current year period were partially offset by increases in certain operating expenses, including health and welfare and performance-based incentive compensation costs. Commodity cost comparisons were negative due primarily to the $14 million LIFO credit recorded last year.

Latin America Beverages

Net sales for the quarter increased 17% driven by higher pricing associated with the pass-through of the sugar tax in Mexico, favorable product and package mix and increased sales volumes. SOP increased 73% as net sales growth, lower commodity costs and ongoing productivity improvements were partially offset by increases in logistic costs and certain operating expenses.

Corporate and Other Items

For the quarter, corporate costs totaled $120 million, including a $23 million unrealized commodity mark-to-market loss. Corporate costs also included a $14 million settlement charge due to the annuitization of certain pension obligations and increases in certain operating expenses, including $6 million in performance-based incentive compensation costs. Corporate costs in the prior year period were $73 million, which included a $3 million unrealized commodity mark-to-market loss. 

Net interest expense was flat in the quarter compared to the prior year period.

For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate was 34.8%. The reported effective tax rate for the prior year period was 34.2%.

Cash Flow

For the year, the company generated $1,022 million of cash from operating activities compared to $866 million in the prior year. Capital spending totaled $170 million compared to $179 million in the prior year period. The company returned $717 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases ($400 million) and dividends ($317 million).

2015 Full-Year Guidance

The company expects full-year reported net sales to be up approximately 1% and expects core EPS to be in the $3.80 to $3.88 range, after the impact of foreign currency, which is expected to negatively impact net sales and core EPS growth by approximately 1% and 2%, respectively. 

Packaging and ingredient costs are expected to decrease COGS by about 1%, on a constant volume/mix basis.

The company expects its core tax rate to be approximately 35.5%.

The company expects capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales.
