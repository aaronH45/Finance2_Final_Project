PINNACLE WEST REPORTS 2014 FOURTH-QUARTER

AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS

•Full-year results benefit from superior operational performance and cost management, despite adverse weather

•Fourth-quarter results impacted by planned fossil outages, partially offset by higher retail energy sales

•Company affirms 2015 guidance

PHOENIX – Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $5.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. This result compares with net income of $24.3 million, or $0.22 per share, for the same period a year ago.

For full-year 2014, Pinnacle West reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $397.6 million, or $3.58 per diluted share, compared to $406.1 million, or $3.66 per share, in 2013.

“Robust operational performance, combined with disciplined cost management, helped us achieve solid full-year financial results, despite weather contributions that were below historical averages and well below last year,” said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt. “And, while our employees had no control over Mother Nature, they remained acutely focused on creating value for customers and shareholders, as evidenced in our top-tier reliability and customer satisfaction metrics, as well as strong performance at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.”

Palo Verde achieved its 23rd consecutive year as the nation’s largest power producer and, for the tenth time, exceeded its own record for power generation – producing 32.3 million megawatt-hours (MWh). The previous best was 31.9 million MWh in 2012. In addition, Unit 3 produced the second-highest electricity output of any nuclear unit in the world, and all three Palo Verde units individually ranked among the top six producers in the U.S., according to industry data.

Brandt cited additional examples of the Company’s recent achievements:

•APS’s reliability numbers for 2014 remained in the top quartile among all electric utilities nationally despite one of the most severe monsoon seasons in Arizona history. For the year, the typical APS customer experienced less than one outage (0.79 power outages compared to a national industry median of 1.14 interruptions). Also, the typical APS customer experienced 79 minutes of interrupted service in 2014, compared with an industry median of 130 minutes. (Industry averages are based on the most currently available data from year-end 2013.) 

•APS launched the Solar Partners residential rooftop solar program, the nation’s first utility-owned research and development program that will make up to 10 megawatts of rooftop solar available to customers, including those with limited income.

•APS again was named an industry leader in customer satisfaction by the 2014 J.D. Power Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study, maintaining APS’s 5th place ranking out of 54 large investor-owned utilities. 

•For the third straight year, Pinnacle West increased its common dividend, raising it by 4.85 percent after two previous increases of 4.0 percent;

•Pinnacle West’s total return to shareholders was 34.5 percent, and total shareholder value increased $2.0 billion in 2014.

The 2014 fourth-quarter results comparison to the 2013 period was adversely affected by the following major factors (a non-GAAP reconciliation table is provided at the end of this release):

•Higher operating expenses impacted earnings by $0.17 per share compared with the prior-year quarter. The increase was largely due to more fossil generation planned outages being completed in the current-year quarter than in the same period a year ago.

The operating expense variance excludes costs associated with renewable energy, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, which are largely offset by comparable amounts of operating revenues.

•Tax-related items, comprised of a tax benefit recorded in 2013 and the extension of bonus depreciation in the 2014 fourth quarter, negatively impacted earnings by $0.06 per share versus a year ago.

•The net effect of other items decreased earnings $0.02 per share.

The above items were offset in part by the following positive influences:

•Decreased interest expense, net of AFUDC, contributed $0.04 per share.

•The effects of weather variations improved the Company’s earnings by $0.03 per share. Although weather in the 2014 and 2013 fourth quarters were less favorable than normal conditions, this year’s quarter benefitted largely from a warmer October than the same month in 2013, thus spurring an increase in customers’ air conditioning use.

•Higher retail electricity sales – excluding the effects of weather variations, but including the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation – improved earnings $0.01 per share. This result marks the second time in 2014 that retail consumption outpaced the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation initiatives. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, weather-normalized sales increased 1.9 percent, while total customer growth was 1.4 percent quarter-over-quarter.

Financial Outlook

For 2015, the Company continues to expect its on-going consolidated earnings will be within a range of $3.75 to $3.95 per diluted share. Longer-term, the Company’s goal is to achieve a consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5 percent annually through 2016.
