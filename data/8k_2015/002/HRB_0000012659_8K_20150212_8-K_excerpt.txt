H&R Block, Inc. (the “Company”) is providing additional information, as described in this Current Report on Form 8-K, regarding its efforts to complete the previously announced sale of certain assets and liabilities, including all of the deposit liabilities, of H&R Block Bank, a federal savings bank (“HRB Bank”) to BofI Federal Bank, a federal savings bank (“BofI”).

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

As described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 10, 2014, HRB Bank, Block Financial LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the sole shareholder of HRB Bank (“Block Financial”), and BofI, entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement on April 10, 2014 (the “P&A Agreement”) whereby HRB Bank will transfer certain assets and liabilities, including all of HRB Bank’s deposit liabilities, to BofI (the “P&A Transaction”). Additionally, the Program Management Agreement, the Emerald Advance Receivables Participation Agreement and the Guaranty Agreement, each as described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 10, 2014, will become effective upon the closing of the P&A Transaction. 

As described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on October 23, 2014, HRB Bank, Block Financial, and BofI entered into a letter agreement amending the P&A Agreement to extend certain dates related to the closing of the P&A Transaction.

On February 12, 2015, HRB Bank, Block Financial, and BofI entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) agreeing to further amend the P&A Agreement as follows: 

▪to amend Section 3.01 to make the date of closing June 30, 2015, unless another date is mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties to the P&A Agreement;

▪to amend Section 9.01(b) to extend the date after which any party is permitted to terminate the P&A Agreement from May 31, 2015 to July 31, 2015; and 

▪to amend Sections 9.01(c) and 9.01(d) of the P&A Agreement to extend the date upon which either party may terminate the agreement for regulatory denial or delay, such that (i) HRB Bank or Block Financial may terminate the P&A Agreement at any time if a regulator has denied a regulatory application filed by BofI in connection with the P&A Transaction or has indicated to BofI that no final decision on a regulatory application filed by BofI can or will be made prior to March 31, 2015 (instead of February 16, 2015 as previously provided), and (ii) BofI may terminate the P&A Agreement at any time if a regulator has denied a regulatory application filed by HRB Bank or Block Financial in connection with the Company’s bank divestiture transaction or has indicated to HRB Bank or Block Financial that no final decision on a regulatory application filed by HRB Bank or Block Financial can or will be made prior to March 31, 2015 (instead of February 16, 2015, as previously provided).

2

As previously disclosed, the P&A Agreement is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of certain required approvals, entry into certain additional agreements, and the fulfillment of various other customary conditions. There can be no assurances regarding when or if the P&A Agreement will ultimately receive regulatory approval, when or if the other closing conditions will be satisfied, or when or if the P&A Transaction will be completed.

The foregoing summary of the Letter Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Letter Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
