The net proceeds of the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, are approximately $589.4 million, which the Company intends to use (i) to repay the U.S. dollar portion outstanding under its $2.0 billion revolving line of credit, which was $105 million as of January 12, 2015, which borrowings were principally used to discharge mortgage indebtedness on certain properties; (ii) to repay its $200.0 million 6.0% Senior Notes due March 2015; (iii) to repay its $200.0 million 7.072% Senior Notes due June 2015; and (iv) for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions, investments or repayment of other indebtedness. Additional details related to this offering may be found in the Prospectus Supplement, dated January 13, 2015 (the “Prospectus Supplement”), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on January 15, 2015. 

The Notes are governed by the terms of the Indenture, dated November 19, 2012 (the “Base Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”), which was filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on November 19, 2012, as supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated January 21, 2015, between the Company and the Trustee (the “Supplemental Indenture”), which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. 

The Notes will mature on February 1, 2025 and the Company will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually on February 1 and August 1, beginning on August 1, 2015. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. 

The Company may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time at its option at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the “make-whole” amounts applicable to the Notes to be redeemed as set forth in the in the section titled “Description of the Notes — Optional Redemption” in the Prospectus Supplement.
