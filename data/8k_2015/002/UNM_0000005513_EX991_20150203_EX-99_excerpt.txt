Unum Group Reports Fourth Quarter 2014 Results

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (February 3, 2015) - Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported a net loss of $279.1 million ($1.11 per common share) for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to net income of $221.2 million ($0.84 per common share) for the fourth quarter of 2013. 

Included in the net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 is an after-tax reserve charge of $453.8 million ($1.80 per common share) in the long-term care closed block, as well as the amortization of prior period actuarial losses on the Company’s pension plans, a settlement loss from a pension plan amendment, and a net realized investment loss, the combined impact of which resulted in an after-tax loss of $54.1 million ($0.21 per common share). The fourth quarter of 2013 included reserve adjustments for a reserve increase related to unclaimed death benefits ($62.1 million after-tax, or $0.24 per common share) and a reserve reduction related to group life waiver of premium benefits ($55.2 million after-tax, or $0.21 per common share), as well as a net realized investment gain and a non-operating retirement-related loss, the combined impact of which resulted in a net after-tax gain of $4.3 million ($0.02 per common share). Additional details regarding the long-term care closed block reserve charge and pension plan amendment loss are included in the Other Information section of this release.

Adjusting for the items above, operating income on an after-tax basis was $228.8 million ($0.90 per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $223.8 million ($0.85 per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

“I am very pleased with the way we finished 2014, with continued solid margins in our core businesses and one of the strongest quarterly premium growth rates we’ve seen in many years,” said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer. “Our top line growth was driven by a balance of strong sales results, solid persistency and continued success with our ongoing renewal and re-pricing actions. Today’s low interest rate environment, though, creates significant challenges for us and for our industry, and we are taking the steps within our core businesses to maintain the solid margins and financial flexibility we’ve worked so hard to attain. In our Closed Block, we strengthened our long-term care reserves this quarter to better position this business for a sustained, difficult environment.”

Premium income in group disability increased 5.7 percent to $540.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $511.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to favorable persistency, premium rate increases, and improved sales growth in recent quarters. Net investment income declined marginally to $132.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $133.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to a decrease in the level of invested assets supporting this line of business and a decline in yields, which were partially offset by higher miscellaneous net investment income. The benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 83.7 percent, compared to 83.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of a reduction of 50 basis points to the group long-term disability new claim discount rate.

Net investment income declined by 4.1 percent to $58.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $60.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to a decrease in yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous net investment income, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability product line in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 30.8 percent compared to 30.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting generally stable claim experience. The benefit ratio for voluntary benefits was 46.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to 66.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, or 49.8 percent excluding the reserve adjustment previously noted, reflecting favorable experience in the disability and life product lines.

In local currency, premium income increased 10.5 percent to £94.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to £85.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting an increased retention level in our reinsurance program for certain of our group life products as well as premium rate increases and improved persistency. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 68.9 percent, compared to 73.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting growth in premium income and favorable risk experience in the group long-term disability and group life lines of business.

Net investment income increased to $37.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $35.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting higher miscellaneous net investment income and higher levels of invested assets, partially offset by a decline in the portfolio yield. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 52.3 percent, compared to 58.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, or 52.4 percent excluding the reserve adjustment previously noted. The relatively stable benefit ratio reflected improved claims experience in the cancer and critical illness product line which offset less favorable experience in the life and accident, sickness, and disability product lines.

Premium income for this segment declined 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to expected policy terminations and maturities. Net investment income declined by 1.3 percent to $323.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $327.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to a decline in yields and lower miscellaneous net investment income which was partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets supporting this segment. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability line of business was 81.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to 85.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting slightly lower new claim incidence in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a slight reduction in the claim reserve discount rate in the fourth quarter of 2013. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 89.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding the reserve charge, compared to 89.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.

OTHER INFORMATION

Long-term Care Closed Block Reserve Charge

Policy reserves for the long-term care block of business are determined using the gross premium valuation method and, prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, were valued based on assumptions established as of December 31, 2011, the date of the initial loss recognition. Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient. The Company undertakes a review of policy reserve adequacy annually during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review.

Included in the fourth quarter of 2014 review was an analysis of the reserve discount rate, mortality, morbidity, persistency, and premium rate increase assumptions. The analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the continued historic low interest rate environment, future market expectations, and the Company’s view of future portfolio yields. The assumptions established in 2011 were set at a level that the Company estimated would be sustainable in a low interest rate environment for three to five years, with improvements in market yields beginning after the third year. Since that time, however, interest rates have continued to hover near historic lows, and credit spreads have tightened. The Company’s assumption update for mortality incorporates the last three years of Company-specific experience and emerging trends as well as industry data, where available and appropriate, and reflects improvements in life expectancies beyond what was initially anticipated in 2011. Morbidity assumptions were updated to reflect trends from the Company’s own emerging experience in claim incidence and terminations, as well as trends based on available and appropriate industry data and studies. Premium rate increase assumptions were updated to reflect progress-to-date and the Company’s on-going rate increase strategy.

Based on the Company’s analysis, as of December 31, 2014 the Company lowered the discount rate assumption to reflect the low interest rate environment and our revised expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates. The Company’s revised assumptions anticipate the low interest rate environment persisting for the next three to five years, with a return to more historical averages over the following five year period. The Company updated its mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize long-term care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant may receive long-term care benefits. Morbidity assumptions were changed to reflect emerging industry experience as well as the Company’s own experience, and the projection of future premium rate increase approvals was updated. Using revised best estimate assumptions, as of December 31, 2014 the Company determined that policy and claim reserves should be increased $698.2 million to reflect the current estimate of future benefit obligations. This charge decreased fourth quarter of 2014 net income $453.8 million.

Settlement Loss from Pension Plan Amendment

In September 2014, the Company amended its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan to allow a limited-time offer of benefit payouts to eligible former employees with a vested right to a pension benefit. The offer provided eligible former employees, regardless of age, with an option to elect to receive a lump-sum settlement of his or her entire accrued pension

benefit in December 2014 or to elect receipt of monthly pension benefits commencing in January 2015. The Company accounted for the lump-sum payouts as settlements and recognized a loss of $64.4 million before tax, or $41.9 million after tax, during the fourth quarter of 2014.

Capital Management

At December 31, 2014, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for the Company’s traditional U.S. insurance companies was in excess of 400 percent, and cash and marketable securities in the holding companies equaled $575 million.

Book Value

Book value per common share as of December 31, 2014 was $33.90, compared to $33.30 at December 31, 2013.

Outlook 

The Company anticipates growth in after-tax operating earnings per share for full-year 2015 to be in the outlook range announced in December 2014 of two percent to five percent.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures of “operating revenue,” “before-tax operating income” or “before-tax operating loss,” “after-tax operating income,” and “after-tax operating loss” differ from total revenue, income (loss) before income tax, and net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated operating results and in income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses, non-operating retirement-related gains or losses, and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. We believe operating revenue and operating income or loss are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business. 

Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses. Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities. 

The amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses, a component of the net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans, is driven by market performance as well as plan amendments and is not indicative of the operational results of our businesses. We believe that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses, as well as the settlement loss from our pension plan amendment, from operating income or loss provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of our operating results. Although we manage our non-operating retirement-related gains or losses separately from the operational performance of our business, these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of our 

UNUM IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK AND MARKETING BRAND OF UNUM GROUP AND ITS INSURING SUBSIDIARIES. 6

company and have historically increased or decreased over time, depending on plan amendments and market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans.

We believe that excluding the 2014 costs related to the early retirement of debt is appropriate because in conjunction with the debt redemption, we recognized in realized investment gains and losses a deferred gain from previously terminated derivatives which were associated with the hedge of this debt. The amount recognized as a realized investment gain, which basically offsets the cost of the debt redemption, is also excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures since we analyze our performance excluding amounts reported as realized investment gains or losses. We believe it provides investors with a more realistic view of our overall profitability if we are consistent in excluding both the cost of the debt retirement as well as the gain on the hedge of the debt.

We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.
