  ITEM 5.02    

DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; 

APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.    

On January 27, 2015, the Board of Directors of Michael Kors Holdings Limited (the “Company”), upon the recommendation of the Company’s Governance and Nominating Committee, appointed Jane Thompson, 43, to its Board of Directors as a Class II director with a term to expire at the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders in 2016 and until the election and qualification of her successor in office. She will also serve as a member of the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Company. The Board has determined that Ms. Thompson is “independent” as such term is defined under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines on director independence. The appointment of Ms. Thompson brings the Company’s Board membership to eight. 

Pursuant to the Company’s current director compensation program, in connection with Ms. Thompson’s appointment, she will receive a retainer of $11,667, which represents a pro rata portion of the Company’s annual retainer of $70,000, based on the number of months left in the Company’s fiscal year. She will also receive a grant of restricted share units under the Company’s Omnibus Incentive Plan with a fair value at the time of grant equal to $75,000, which represents the pro rata portion of the $150,000 annual equity grant provided to all non-employee directors at the 2014 annual meeting of shareholders, based on the number of months remaining until the Company’s next annual shareholder’s meeting. Ms. Thompson is also entitled to a fee of $1,500 for each meeting of the Board of Directors that she attends. 

There is no arrangement or understanding between Ms. Thompson and any other persons pursuant to which she was selected to serve as a director and she is not a party to any transaction with the Company that might require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. 

Further details are contained in a Press Release issued by the Company on January 27, 2015, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
