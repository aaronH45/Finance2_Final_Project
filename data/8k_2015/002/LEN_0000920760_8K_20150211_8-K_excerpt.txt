Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On February 11, 2015, Lennar Corporation (the “Company”) and most of its subsidiaries as Guarantors (as defined below) offered and sold $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (the “Notes”) under an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. The Notes were sold at a public offering price of 100.25% of their principal amount. The Company had previously issued $350 million of 4.50% Senior Notes due 2019 on November 25, 2014. The Notes are guaranteed by most, but not all, of the Company’s subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”), but the guarantee by particular subsidiaries may be suspended or terminated under some circumstances. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and for general corporate purposes.  

The offering had been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-199159, and the prospectus supplement dated February 11, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on February 12, 2015. The sale is expected to close on February 17, 2015, subject to customary closing conditions. A legal opinion relating to the Notes is filed herewith as Exhibit 5.1.
