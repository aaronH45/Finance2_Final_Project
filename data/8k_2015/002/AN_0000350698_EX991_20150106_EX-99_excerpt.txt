The information provided in this news release is based on unaudited sales reports provided by our stores to the applicable automotive manufacturers. These reports are prepared based on the standards established by the applicable automotive manufacturers, which differ from GAAP revenue recognition and other requirements. For example, the classification of certain transactions under the standards established by certain such manufacturers differs under GAAP. Reported retail sales also includes vehicles placed into certain manufacturer-approved demonstrator vehicle and service loaner programs, which vehicles may be sold as new or used vehicles under GAAP in subsequent periods. In addition, the sales reports are based on the time periods set by the automotive manufacturers for reporting monthly sales, which generally differ from the calendar month. As a result, our operating results calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, including our new vehicle unit sales, may differ materially from any results expressed or implied by the information provided in our monthly sales reports and summarized in this news release and future news releases. In addition, reported retail sales are subject to seasonal trends. Consequently, reported retail sales for a particular month are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full quarter or year.
