DETROIT - General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) today announced fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $1.1 billion, or $0.66 per diluted share, which included a net loss from special items of $0.9 billion or $(0.53) per diluted share. Included in special items during the quarter was an $(0.8) billion reduction to net income attributable to common stockholders related to the redemption of all outstanding Series A preferred shares. 

In the fourth quarter of 2013, GM’s net income attributable to common stockholders was $0.9 billion, or $0.57 per diluted share, including a net loss from special items of $0.2 billion or $(0.10) per diluted share. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $39.6 billion, compared with $40.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) adjusted was $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

“A strong fourth quarter helped us deliver very good core operating results in 2014 despite significant challenges we and the industry faced,” said GM CEO Mary Barra. “By keeping our customers at the center of all our decisions, we addressed those challenges head-on and outlined a customer-focused strategic plan that will guide our company well into the future.”

Full-Year Results

GM reported 2014 full-year net income attributable to common stockholders of $2.8 billion, or $1.65 per diluted share, down from $3.8 billion, or $2.38 per diluted share in 2013. Core automotive operating performance improved in 2014, but results were more than offset by incremental recall and restructuring costs, and a net loss from special items. 

Special items during the calendar year impacted full-year net income to common stockholders unfavorably by $(2.4) billion, or $(1.40) per diluted share, compared to an unfavorable $(1.3) billion impact in 2013, or $(0.80) per diluted share. 

In 2014, full-year net income was also impacted unfavorably by recall-related pre-tax costs of $2.8 billion, or $(1.07) per diluted share. Income tax expense in 2014 was favorably impacted by recall-related costs and special items. 

Revenue increased to $155.9 billion, compared with $155.4 billion in 2013. 

Full-year EBIT-adjusted was $6.5 billion, compared with $8.6 billion in 2013. Full-year EBIT-adjusted for 2014 includes the impact of $2.8 billion for recall-related costs and restructuring charges of $1.0 billion.

Based on GM’s continued strong results, and consistent with its stated strategy of a strong and growing dividend, the company intends to increase the second quarter dividend on its common stock by 20 percent to 36 cents per share. The decision on the expected dividend increase will be made by the GM Board of Directors as part of the regularly scheduled second quarter dividend declaration procedure. 

“Our intention to increase the dividend is consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy and reflects the confidence we have in the growing strength of our business,” said Barra. “Our goal is to maximize long-term shareholder value through both stock price appreciation and return of capital.”

Forward-Looking Statements

In this press release and in related comments by our management, our use of the words ”plans,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “possible,” “potential,” “target,” “believe,” “commit,” “intend,” “continue,” “may,” “would,” “could,” “should,” “project,” “appears,” “potential,” “projected,” “upside,” “positioned,” “outlook” or similar expressions is intended to identify forward-looking statements that represent our current judgment about possible future events. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any events or financial results, and our actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors. Among other items, such factors may include: our ability to realize production efficiencies and to achieve reductions in costs as a result of our restructuring initiatives and labor modifications; our ability to maintain quality control over our vehicles and avoid material vehicle recalls and the cost and effect on our reputation of product recalls; our ability to maintain adequate financing sources, including as required to fund our planned significant investment in new technology; the ability of our suppliers to timely deliver parts, components and systems; our ability to realize successful vehicle applications of new technology; overall strength and stability of our markets, particularly outside of North America and China; costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations including those related to our recent recalls; and our ability to continue to attract new customers, particularly for our new products. GM's most recent annual report on Form 10-K provides information about these and other factors, which we may revise or supplement in future reports to the SEC.

Supplemental Material

(Unaudited)

The accompanying tables and charts include earnings before interest and taxes adjusted for special items, presented net of noncontrolling interests (EBIT-adjusted) and Automotive adjusted free cash flow. These metrics are not prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and have not been audited or reviewed by GM's independent auditors. EBIT-adjusted and Adjusted automotive free cash flow are considered non-GAAP financial measures.

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding GM's operating results because they exclude amounts that management does not consider part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the organization. Management believes these measures allow it to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions. Accordingly, GM believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in allowing for additional transparency of GM's core operations and they are therefore used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.

While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information, they are not operating measures under U.S. GAAP, and there are limitations associated with their use. GM's calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in their method of calculation. As a result the use of these non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures.

The following table summarizes the reconciliation of EBIT-adjusted to its most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, Income before income taxes (dollars in millions):

(a)Increase in GMNA employees in the year ended December 31, 2013 includes an increase of approximately 4,000 employees due to insourcing of certain information technology support functions that were previously provided by outside parties and an increase of approximately 3,000 employees due to increase in launches and ramp up in manufacturing volume.

(b)Increase in GM Financial employees in the year ended December 31, 2013 is due to the acquisition of certain Ally Financial international operations.

Vehicle Sales

GM presents both wholesale and retail vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of its revenue and market share. GM does not currently export vehicles to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria. Accordingly, these countries are excluded from industry sales data in the tables below and corresponding calculations of its market share.

Wholesale Vehicle Sales

Wholesale vehicle sales data, which represents sales directly to dealers and others, is the measure that correlates vehicle sales to revenue from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of automotive Net sales and revenue. Wholesale vehicle sales exclude vehicles produced by unconsolidated joint ventures. In the year ended December 31, 2014, 52.9% of GMs wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes total wholesale vehicle sales of new vehicles by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):

Retail Vehicle Sales and Market Share

Retail vehicle sales data, which represents estimated sales to the end customer, including fleets, does not correlate directly to the revenue GM recognizes during the period. However, retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for GM vehicles, is the basis for its market share, and is based upon the good faith estimates of management. Retail vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures. Market share information is based primarily on retail vehicle sales volume, but estimates may be used where retail vehicle sales volume is not available. 

In countries where end customer data is not readily available other data sources, such as wholesale or forecast volumes, are used to estimate retail vehicle sales. Certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in retail vehicle sales at the time of delivery to the daily rental car companies. Market share information is based on retail vehicles sales volume. The following table summarizes total industry retail sales volume, or estimated sales volume where retail sales volume is not available, of new vehicles and the related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands):
