Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On January 7, 2015, the Company issued a press release commenting on financial guidance for 2014 and announcing financial guidance for 2015. In addition, on the same day, the Company held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss this guidance. The teleconference was web cast on the Company's web site. The press release is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.

The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes a description of certain historical and potential non-GAAP items that affect our financial expectations for 2015. 

Our non-GAAP financial measures adjust our reported results to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, we exclude amortization of intangibles primarily associated with costs of marketed products acquired or licensed from third parties. We also exclude other items that are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. 

Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective financial guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible. 

The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
