Item 5.02.Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On January 30, 2015, Altria Group, Inc. (the “Company”) announced that David R. Beran, after 38 years of distinguished service to the Company and its subsidiaries, informed the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) on January 27, 2015 of his intention to retire as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company effective March 1, 2015. The Company further announced that the Board, on January 29, 2015, elected Howard A. Willard III to become Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and William F. Gifford, Jr. to become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, both appointments to become effective immediately upon Mr. Beran’s retirement. The Board also elected Martin J. Barrington to become President of the Company in addition to being its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, also effective immediately upon Mr. Beran’s retirement. 

Mr. Willard, age 51, currently serves as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and has been continuously employed by the Company or its subsidiaries in various positions since 1992. 

Mr. Gifford, age 44, currently serves as Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business Development of the Company and has been continuously employed by the Company or its subsidiaries in various positions since 1994. 

Mr. Barrington, age 61, currently serves as the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and has been continuously employed by the Company or its subsidiaries in various positions since 1993.

The Company issued a press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The section of this press release entitled “Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Transitions” is incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference. 

Compensation of Messrs. Willard and Gifford 

In connection with his appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company effective March 1, 2015, Mr. Willard’s annual salary will be $800,000. Mr. Willard also received a special grant of 27,500 restricted stock units. Because Mr. Willard will remain in Salary Band B, his annual incentive, long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) and annual equity award targets remain unchanged from his previous targets as follows: Mr. Willard’s annual incentive award target for 2015 will be 95% of salary; his LTIP award target will be 200% of the sum of each year-end salary for the three years of the 2014-2016 performance cycle; and his annual equity award target for 2016 will be $1,275,000.

In connection with his appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective March 1, 2015, Mr. Gifford’s annual salary will be $610,000. Mr. Gifford also received a special grant of 27,500 restricted stock units. Mr. Gifford will move to Salary Band B, which will result in increased annual incentive, LTIP and annual equity award targets as follows: Mr. Gifford’s annual incentive award target for 2015 will be 95% of salary; his LTIP award target will be the sum of 125% of his year-end salary for 2014 and 200% of his year-end salary for the remainder of the 2014-2016 performance cycle; and his annual equity award target for 2016 will be $1,275,000.

Each of Mr. Willard’s and Mr. Gifford’s special restricted stock unit awards will vest five years from the grant date. Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock upon vesting and dividend equivalent payments during the vesting period. Individual award amounts were subject to and comply with the limits prescribed by the Company’s shareholder-approved 2010 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2010 Performance Incentive Plan”). A copy of the form of restricted stock unit agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference.

Compensation of Mr. Beran 

In connection with his retirement, Mr. Beran will remain eligible for pro-rated cash payments for his service through February 28, 2015 under the (i) annual incentive award program based on Company and individual performance ratings at target and (ii) LTIP based on an individual performance rating at target and a Company performance rating determined at the conclusion of the three-year performance cycle in accordance with the LTIP. The pro-rated payments will be made shortly following the effective date of Mr. Beran’s retirement for the 2015 annual incentive award program and in February 2017 for the LTIP. There is no guarantee of any payment under the LTIP. Mr. Beran’s award target for the annual incentive award program is 95% of salary for the portion of 2015 during which he is employed, and his award target for the LTIP is 200% of his year-end 2014 salary over the portion of the three-year performance cycle during which he is employed. These targets are consistent with the pre-existing targets for Salary Band B. Mr. Beran will also receive, upon his retirement, a lump sum cash payment in an aggregate amount equal to the sum of one-third the value of his unvested 2014 restricted stock award (46,290 shares before applying the one-third proration) and two-thirds the value of his unvested 2013 restricted stock award (56,310 shares before applying the two-thirds proration). Values will be determined using the average closing price on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index for a share of the Company’s common stock on each of the 20 trading days immediately preceding and including February 28, 2015.

The Company’s annual incentive award program, LTIP and other executive compensation programs are more fully described in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of the Company’s proxy statement for its 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 3, 2014), which discussion is incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference.
