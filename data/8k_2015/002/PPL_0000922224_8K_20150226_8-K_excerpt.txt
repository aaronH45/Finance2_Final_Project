Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock, capital needs and determinations by the Company of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. Any Shares sold will be offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-202290) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2015.
