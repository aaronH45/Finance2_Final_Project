CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT BENEFITS FROM GLOBAL REACH 

In 2014, Prologis invested $4.3 billion ($3.1 billion Prologis’ share) as the  

company deployed capital at attractive yields of 6.8 percent (Prologis’  

share).  

“The global nature of our platform allows us to deploy capital where we see  

the highest risk-adjusted returns,” adds Moghadam. “In the U.S., where  

market conditions are very strong and values are high, we were a net seller  

of non-strategic holdings. In Europe, the focus has been on net deployment  

where we acquired quality assets in target markets at a discount to  

replacement costs.”   

Value Creation and Development Starts  

In 2014, Prologis generated an estimated $301.6 million ($272.6 million  

Prologis’ share) of value creation from development stabilizations and  

through its value-added conversion program.  

Development Stabilizations  

In the fourth quarter, the company generated $55.4 million ($46.1 million  

Prologis’ share) of estimated value creation from $247.4 million ($201.7  

million Prologis’ share) of development stabilizations at an estimated  

development margin of 22.4 percent. For the full year 2014, the company  

stabilized $1.1 billion ($955.2 million Prologis’ share) of development  

projects with an estimated development margin of 23.0 percent, generating 

$254.5 million ($235.8 million Prologis’ share) of estimated value creation.  

Development Starts  

During the quarter, Prologis started $725.2 million ($625.8 million Prologis’  

share) of new developments with an estimated weighted average yield  

upon stabilization of 7.3 percent and an estimated development margin of  

21.0 percent. For the full year 2014, the company started $2.0 billion ($1.8  

billion Prologis’ share) of new developments with an estimated weighted  

average yield upon stabilization of 7.2 percent and an estimated  

development margin of 20.0 percent. Build-to-suits represented 49.6  

percent of development starts in the fourth quarter and 32.6 percent for  

the full year 2014.  

SAN FRANCISCO (Jan. 27, 2015) – Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD), the global  

leader in industrial real estate, today reported results for the fourth quarter  

and full year 2014.  

Core funds from operations (Core FFO) per diluted share was $0.48 for the  

fourth quarter compared with $0.43 for the same period in 2013. For the  

full year 2014, Core FFO per diluted share was $1.88, an increase of 14  

percent over 2013.   

“As we closed out the year, our global occupancies continued to climb and  

development leasing reached its highest level in seven years,” said Hamid R. 

Moghadam, chairman and CEO, Prologis. “The outperformance is a direct 

result of our long-term strategy of operating in infill markets where global 

trade and consumption intersect.”  

Prologis ended the quarter with 96.1 percent occupancy in its operating  

portfolio, an increase of 100 basis points over the same period in 2013 and  

110 basis points over the prior quarter. The quarterly increase was  

principally driven by a 160 basis point increase in spaces under 100,000  

square feet and a 140 basis point increase in the company’s European  

portfolio.  

In the fourth quarter, the company leased 41.7 million square feet (3.9  

million square meters) in its combined operating and development  

portfolios, which includes 8.9 million square feet (0.8 million square meters) 

of properties under development. Tenant retention was 85.5 percent.  

Rent change on rollovers was positive for the eighth consecutive quarter,  

with GAAP rental rates on signed leases increasing 6.2 percent. In the  

Americas, GAAP rental rates on signed leases increased 11.5 percent.  

During the fourth quarter, same store NOI for the owned and managed  

portfolio increased 4.1 percent on a GAAP basis, resulting in full year 2014  

same store NOI growth of 3.7 percent. On a Prologis’ share basis, same  

store NOI (GAAP) increased 4.9 percent during the fourth quarter.

At year end, the book value of the company’s land bank totaled $1.8 billion  

with an estimated build-out potential of $10.7 billion.  

Acquisitions  

In the fourth quarter, Prologis acquired $151.4 million ($48.2 million Prologis’  

share) of buildings through its co-investment ventures with a stabilized  

capitalization rate on Prologis’ share of 6.5 percent. For the full year 2014, the  

company acquired $1.5 billion ($659.4 million Prologis’ share) of buildings at a  

stabilized capitalization rate on Prologis’ share of 6.4 percent. More than  

three-quarters of these buildings were in Europe, where the company  

purchased assets at a discount to replacement costs.  

Equity Invested in Co-Investment Ventures  

During the year, the company invested $679.0 million in the Prologis North  

American Industrial Fund, through a series of investments, at a weighted  

average stabilized capitalization rate of 6.1 percent. As a result, the company  

increased its ownership to 66.1 percent and consolidated the venture.  

Contributions & Dispositions  

During the fourth quarter, Prologis completed $213.2 million ($104.3 million  

Prologis’ share) of contributions to its co-investment ventures and third-party  

building dispositions of non-strategic assets of $500.3 million ($406.8 million  

Prologis’ share). Prologis’ share of contributions and dispositions had a  

stabilized capitalization rate of 5.9 percent.  

During the full year, the company completed $1.7 billion ($948.7 million  

Prologis’ share) of contributions at a weighted average stabilized capitalization  

rate (Prologis’ share) of 5.8 percent, and $1.5 billion ($1.3 billion Prologis’  

share) of building dispositions at a weighted average stabilized capitalization  

rate (Prologis’ share) of 6.4 percent.  

FINANCIAL STRENGTH A TOP PRIORITY   

Prologis completed more than $1.7 billion of capital markets activity in the  

quarter, including the previously announced issuance of a €600 million euro  

bond, as well as $356 million of equity issuance from the exercise of warrants  

related to the formation of its Prologis European Logistics Partners venture  

and through its At-the-Market equity program. In the full year, the company  

completed $7.0 billion of capital markets activity.  

“We have effectively converted the currency composition of our balance sheet  

to U.S. dollars,” said Tom Olinger, chief financial officer, Prologis. “At year end,  

our U.S. dollar  

net equity exposure was 89 percent—this allows us to operate globally with  

our earnings and net asset value insulated from movements in foreign  

currencies. We are also taking advantage of the low interest environment to  

enhance our debt stack, and maintaining significant liquidity to keep us nimble 

as opportunities arise.”  

In the strategic capital business, the company maintained a healthy  

investment queue and raised $2.5 billion through both private and public  

capital during the year.  

NET EARNINGS  

Net earnings per diluted share was $0.81 for the fourth quarter compared with 

$0.12 for the same period in 2013. For the full year 2014, net earnings per 

diluted share was $1.24 compared with $0.64 for the full year 2013.  

GUIDANCE ESTABLISHED FOR 2015  

Prologis established a full year 2015 Core FFO guidance range of $2.04 to 

$2.12 per diluted share, representing 11 percent growth at the midpoint 

compared with full year 2014. The company expects to recognize net earnings, 

for GAAP purposes, of $0.40 to $0.48 per share. This assumes (on an owned 

and managed basis):  

•  

Year-end occupancy between 95.5 and 96.5 percent  

•  

GAAP same store NOI growth between 3.5 and 4.5 percent  

•  

Development stabilizations between $1.7 and $1.9 billion  

•  

Development starts between $2.3 and $2.6 billion  

•  

Building acquisitions between $1.0 and $1.5 billion  

•  

Contributions to co-investment ventures between $1.3 and $1.8 billion 

•  

Third-party dispositions between $1.5 and $2.0 billion  

•  

Strategic capital revenue between $210 and $220 million  

•  

Net G&A between $238 and $248 million  

The Core FFO and earnings guidance reflected above excludes any potential  

future gains (losses) recognized from real estate transactions. In reconciling  

from net earnings to Core FFO, Prologis makes certain adjustments including  

but not limited to real estate depreciation and amortization expenses, gains  

(losses) recognized from real estate transactions and early extinguishment of  

debt or redemption of preferred stock, impairment charges, deferred taxes  

and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency or derivative activity.  

The difference between the company's Core FFO and net earnings guidance  

for 2015 predominantly relates to real estate depreciation.

(D)Promote opportunity is every three years.  

(E)Promote opportunity is every year.  

(F)We have an opportunity to earn a promote, at the end of the term of the fund, based on the performance of the Brazil Fund only. We do not have a promote opportunity in any of the other Brazil joint ventures.  

(G)Values represent Prologis’ adjusted basis and may not be comparable to values reflected in the ventures’ stand alone financial statements calculated on a different basis.

(A) For contributions, this amount reflects cash proceeds to Prologis, net of units received for partial consideration. (B) This is a consolidated co-investment venture.  

(C) In June 2014, we completed the initial public offering for FIBRA Prologis, a Mexican real estate investment trust, on the Mexican Stock Exchange. We received equity units of FIBRA Prologis in exchange for our investment in 177 properties aggregating 29.7 million square feet. The portfolio of properties was purchased by FIBRA Prologis from us and two of our co-investment ventures (Prologis Mexico Fondo Logistico, a consolidated venture, and Prologis Mexico Industrial Fund, an unconsolidated venture).

Notes and Definitions  

Notes and Definitions Supplemental 4Q 2014  

Please refer to our annual and quarterly financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other public reports for further information about us and our business. Certain amounts from previous periods presented in the Supplemental Information have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  

During 2014, we increased our ownership in Prologis North American Industrial Fund (“NAIF”) to 66.1% by acquiring equity units from several partners. As a result, we gained control over NAIF and began consolidating this entity beginning October 20, 2014. We revalued our equity investment in NAIF from its carrying value to the estimated fair value and recognized a gain of $201.3 million. The assets and liabilities of this venture, as well as the activity since the acquisition date, are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of net assets acquired was $2.8 billion in real estate assets, $62.0 million of net other assets, $1.2 billion in debt and $554.5 million for noncontrolling interests. Throughout the supplemental information, we have presented the financial position and activity since the acquisition, net of the third party share, in the consolidated information and any activity prior to the consolidation in the unconsolidated information.  

Acquisition cost, as presented for building acquisitions, represents the economic cost and not necessarily what is capitalized. It includes the initial purchase price; the effects of marking assumed debt to market; if applicable, all due diligence and lease intangibles; and estimated acquisition capital expenditures including leasing costs to achieve stabilization.  

Adjusted EBITDA. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure both our operating performance and liquidity. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA beginning with consolidated net earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders and removing the effect of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, third party acquisition expenses related to the acquisition of real estate, gains or losses from the acquisition or disposition of investments in real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and derivative contracts (including cash charges), similar adjustments we make to our FFO measures (see definition below), and other non-cash charges or gains (such as stock based compensation amortization and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency and derivative activity and related amortization). We make adjustments to reflect our economic ownership in each entity, whether consolidated or unconsolidated.  

We consider Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of income tax, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense and other items (including stock-based compensation amortization and certain unrealized gains and losses), gains or losses from the acquisition or disposition of investments in real estate, items that affect comparability, and other significant non-cash items. We also include a pro forma adjustment in Adjusted EBITDA to reflect a full period of NOI on the operating properties we acquire, stabilize or dispose of during the quarter assuming the transaction occurred at the beginning of the quarter. By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure our operating performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of our operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. Gains and losses on the early extinguishment of debt generally include the costs of repurchasing debt securities. While not infrequent or unusual in nature, these items result from market fluctuations that can have inconsistent effects on our results of operations. The economics underlying these items reflect market and financing conditions in the short-term but can obscure our performance and the value of our long-term investment decisions and strategies.  

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors to analyze our ability to meet interest payment obligations and to make quarterly preferred share dividends. We believe that investors should consider Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net earnings (the primary measure of our performance) and the other required Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) measures of our performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of our operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of our performance against other companies. By using Adjusted EBITDA, an investor is assessing the earnings generated by our operations but not taking into account the eliminated expenses or gains incurred in connection with such operations. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should be used in conjunction with our required GAAP presentations. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, distribution requirements or contractual commitments. Adjusted EBITDA, also does not reflect the cash required to make interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt.  

While EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity. Further, our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. We compensate for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net earnings (loss), a GAAP measurement.  

Adjusted Cash NOI (Actual). A reconciliation of our rental income and rental expenses included in our Statement of Operations to adjusted cash NOI for the consolidated operating portfolio for purposes of the Net Asset Value calculation is as follows (in thousands):  

Rental income $ 402,014 Rental expenses (108,370) NOI 293,644  

Net termination fees and adjustments (a) 150  

Less: actual NOI for development portfolio and other (13,825)

Adjusted NOI for consolidated operating portfolio owned at December 31, 2014 256,631  

Straight-lined rents (c) (7,929) Free rent (c) 11,395  

Amortization of lease intangibles (c) 6,385 Less: third party share 84  

Fourth Quarter Adjusted Cash NOI (Actual) $ 266,566  

(a) Net termination fees generally represent the gross fee negotiated at the time a customer is allowed to terminate its lease agreement offset by that customer’s rent leveling asset or liability, if any, that has been previously recognized. Removing the net termination fees from rental income allows for the calculation of Adjusted Cash NOI (Pro forma) to include only rental income that is indicative of the property’s recurring operating performance.  

(b)  

   The actual NOI for properties that were contributed or sold during the three-month period is removed.  

(c) Straight-lined rents, free rent amount, and amortization of lease intangibles (above and below market leases) are removed from rental income for the Operating Portfolio to allow for the calculation of a cash yield.  

Adjusted Cash NOI (Pro forma) consists of Adjusted Cash NOI (Actual) for the properties in our Operating Portfolio adjusted to reflect NOI for a full quarter for operating properties that were acquired or stabilized during the quarter. Adjusted Cash NOI (Pro forma) for the properties in our Development Portfolio is based on current Total Expected Investment and an estimated stabilized yield.  

Assets Under Management (“AUM”) represents the estimated value of the real estate we own or manage through both our consolidated and unconsolidated entities. We calculate AUM by adding the third party investors’ share of the estimated fair value of the assets in the co-investment ventures to our share of total market capitalization (calculated using the market price of our equity plus our share of total debt).

Development Margin is calculated on developed properties as the estimated value at Stabilization minus estimated total investment, before closing costs, the impact of any deferred rents, taxes or third party promotes net of deferred amounts on contributions, divided by the estimated total investment.  

Development Portfolio includes industrial properties that are under development and properties that are developed but have not met Stabilization.  

Discontinued Operations. In April 2014, the FASB issued a standard updating the accounting and disclosure regarding discontinued operations. Early adoption on a prospective basis is allowed, therefore, we have adopted this standard as of January 1, 2014. As a result, none of our property dispositions in 2014 met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. The operations of the properties that were disposed of to third parties during 2013 that met the criteria for discontinued operations, including the aggregate net gains or losses recognized upon their disposition, are presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The income attributable to these properties was as follows (in thousands):

Estimated Build Out (TEI and sq ft)- represents the estimated TEI and finished square feet available for rent upon completion of an industrial building on existing parcels of land.  

FFO, as defined by Prologis; Core FFO; Core AFFO (collectively referred to as “FFO”). FFO is a non-GAAP measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings. Although the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) has published a definition of FFO, modifications to the NAREIT calculation of FFO are common among REITs, as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business.  

FFO is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present, nor do we intend it to present, a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance. We believe net earnings computed under GAAP remains the primary measure of performance and that FFO is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP. Further, we believe our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance.  

NAREIT’s FFO measure adjusts net earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We agree that these NAREIT adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons:  

(i) historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes, through depreciation charges, that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. NAREIT stated in its White Paper on FFO “since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.” Consequently, NAREIT’s definition of FFO reflects the fact that real estate, as an asset class, generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by GAAP do not reflect the underlying economic realities.  

(ii) REITs were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long-term ownership and management of real estate. The exclusion, in NAREIT’s definition of FFO, of gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT’s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. We include the gains and losses (including impairment charges) from dispositions of land and development properties, as well as our proportionate share of the gains and losses (including impairment charges) from dispositions of development properties recognized by our unconsolidated entities, in our definition of FFO.  

Our FFO Measures  

At the same time that NAREIT created and defined its FFO measure for the REIT industry, it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community.” We believe stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined FFO measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under GAAP in addition to those included in the NAREIT defined measure of FFO. Our FFO measures are used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses.  

We use these FFO measures, including by segment and region, to: (i) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions; (ii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (iv) assess our performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general; and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. Because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long-term outlook, we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of short-term items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long-term performance of the properties. The long-term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income. While not infrequent or unusual, these additional items we exclude in calculating FFO, as defined by Prologis, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.  

We use our FFO measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.  

FFO, as defined by Prologis  

To arrive at FFO, as defined by Prologis, we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude:  

(i)  

   deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;  

(ii) current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in GAAP earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure;  

(iii) unhedged foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities; (iv) foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement (based on current foreign currency exchange rates) of certain third party debt of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities; and  

(v) mark-to-market adjustments and related amortization of debt discounts associated with derivative financial instruments.

Notes and Definitions (continued) Supplemental 4Q 2014  

We calculate FFO, as defined by Prologis for our unconsolidated entities on the same basis as we calculate our FFO, as defined by Prologis.  

We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy.  

Core FFO  

In addition to FFO, as defined by Prologis, we also use Core FFO. To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust FFO, as defined by Prologis, to exclude the following recurring and non-recurring items that we recognized directly or our share of these items recognized by our unconsolidated entities to the extent they are included in FFO, as defined by Prologis: (i) gains or losses from acquisition, contribution or sale of land or development properties; (ii) income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate and third-party acquisition costs related to the acquisition of real estate; (iii) impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties; (iv) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; (v) merger, acquisition and other integration expenses; and (vi) expenses related to natural disasters.  

We believe it is appropriate to further adjust our FFO, as defined by Prologis for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets, rather than factors specific to the on-going operating performance of our properties or investments. The impairment charges we have recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate, which had declined due to market conditions, that we no longer expected to hold for long-term investment. Over the last few years, we made it a priority to strengthen our financial position by reducing our debt, our investment in certain low yielding assets and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. As a result, we changed our intent to sell or contribute certain of our real estate properties and recorded impairment charges when we did not expect to recover the costs of our investment. Also, we purchased portions of our debt securities when we believed it was advantageous to do so, which was based on market conditions, and in an effort to lower our borrowing costs and extend our debt maturities. As a result, we have recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time. In addition, we and our co-investment ventures make acquisitions of real estate and we believe the costs associated with these transactions are transaction based and not part of our core operations.  

We analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental income of our real estate and the revenue driven by our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities. Although the adjustments we make to arrive at Core FFO have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long-term.  

We use Core FFO, including by segment and region, to: (i) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions; (ii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (iv) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; (v) assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. Because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long-term outlook, we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long-term performance of the properties we own. As noted above, we believe the long-term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income. We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy.  

Core AFFO  

To arrive at Core AFFO, we adjust Core FFO to further exclude our share of; (i) straight-line rents; (ii) amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles; (iii) recurring capital expenditures; (iv) amortization of management contracts; (v) amortization of debt premiums and discounts and financing costs, net of amounts capitalized, and; (vi) stock compensation expense.  

We believe Core AFFO provides a meaningful indicator of our ability to fund cash needs, including cash distributions to our stockholders.  

Limitations on Use of our FFO Measures  

While we believe our defined FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT’s nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some of these limitations are:  

Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Further, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of industrial properties are not reflected in FFO.  

Gains or losses from property acquisitions and dispositions or impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of acquired or disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.  

The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our defined FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our defined FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.  

The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our defined FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.  

The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our debt at less or more than our future obligation.  

The merger, acquisition and other integration expenses and the natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred.  

We compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our defined FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP.

Fixed Charge Coverage is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of net interest expense adjusted for amortization of finance costs and debt discount (premium), capitalized interest, and preferred stock dividends. We use fixed charge coverage to measure our liquidity. We believe that fixed charge coverage is relevant and useful to investors because it allows fixed income investors to measure our ability to make interest payments on outstanding debt and make distributions/dividends to preferred unitholders/stockholders. Our computation of fixed charge coverage is not calculated in accordance with applicable SEC rules and may not be comparable to fixed charge coverage reported by other companies.

Market Classification  

· Global Markets feature large population centers with high per-capita consumption and are located near major seaports, airports, and ground transportation systems.  

· Regional Markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain, but rather serve local consumption and are often less supply constrained. Markets included as regional markets include: Austin, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Columbus, Denver, Hungary, Indianapolis, Juarez, Las Vegas, Louisville, Memphis, Nashville, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Reno, Reynosa, San Antonio, Slovakia, Sweden and Tijuana.  

· Other Markets represent a small portion of our portfolio that is located outside global and regional markets. These markets include: Austria, Boston, El Paso, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Norfolk, Romania, Salt Lake City, Savannah and St Louis.  

Net Asset Value (“NAV”). We consider NAV to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it enables both management and investors to estimate the fair value of our business. The assessment of the fair value of a particular segment of our business is subjective in that it involves estimates and can be calculated using various methods. Therefore, we  

41  

Copyright © 2015 Prologis  

Notes and Definitions  

(continued) Supplemental 4Q 2014  

have presented the financial results and investments related to our business segments that we believe are important in calculating our NAV but have not presented any specific methodology nor provided any guidance on the assumptions or estimates that should be used in the calculation.  

The components of NAV do not consider the potential changes in rental and fee income streams or the franchise value associated with our global operating platform, strategic capital platform, or development platform.  

Net Effective Rent is calculated at the beginning of the lease using the estimated total cash to be received over the term of the lease (including base rent and expense reimbursements) and annualized. Amounts derived in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar have been translated using the average rate from the previous twelve months. The per square foot number is calculated by dividing the annualized net effective rent by the occupied square feet of the lease.  

Net Effective Rent Change (GAAP) represents the change on operating portfolio properties in net effective rental rates (average rate over the lease term) on new and renewed leases signed during the period as compared with the previous effective rental rates in that same space.  

Net Operating Income “NOI”) represents rental (income less rental expenses.  

Noncontrolling Interest. The following table includes information for each entity we consolidate and in which we own less than 100% (dollars in thousands):

Operating Portfolio includes stabilized industrial properties in our owned and managed portfolio. A developed property moves into the Operating Portfolio when it meets Stabilization.  

Pro-Rata Balance Sheet and Operating Information. The consolidated amounts shown are derived from and prepared on a consistent basis with our consolidated financial statements and are adjusted to remove the amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. The Prologis share of unconsolidated co-investment ventures column was derived on an entity-by-entity basis by applying our ownership percentage to each line item to calculate our share of that line item. For purposes of balance sheet data, we used our ownership percentage at the end of the period and for operating information, we used our average ownership percentage for the period, consistent with how we calculate our share of net earnings (loss) during the period. We used a similar calculation to derive the noncontrolling interests’ share of each line item. In order to present the total owned and managed portfolio, we added our investors’ share of each line item in the unconsolidated co-investment ventures and the noncontrolling interests share of each line item to the Prologis Total Share.  

Prologis Share represents our proportionate economic ownership of each entity included in our total owned and managed portfolio.

We evaluate the operating performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “Same Store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures. We include the properties included in our owned and managed portfolio that were in operation at January 1, 2013 and throughout the full periods in both 2013 and 2014. We have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party from the population for both periods. We believe the factors that impact rental income, rental expenses and NOI in the Same Store portfolio are generally the same as for the total operating portfolio. In order to derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the current exchange rate to translate from local currency into U.S. dollars, for both periods.  

Our same store measures are non-GAAP measures that are commonly used in the real estate industry and are calculated beginning with rental income and rental expenses from the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. It is also common in the real estate industry and expected from the analyst and investor community that these numbers be further adjusted to remove certain non-cash items included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP to reflect a cash same store number. In order to clearly label these metrics, we call one Same Store NOI- GAAP and one Same Store NOI-Adjusted Cash. As these are non-GAAP measures they have certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies. As a result, we provide a reconciliation from our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP to Same Store NOI-GAAP and then to Same Store NOI-Adjusted Cash with explanations of how these metrics are calculated and adjusted.

Same Store—NOI- Adjusted Cash $ 564,937 $ 541,189 4.4%  

(a) To calculate Same Store rental income, we exclude the net termination and renegotiation fees to allow us to evaluate the growth or items that are not indicative of the property’s  

(b) To calculate Same Store rental expense, we include an allocation of the property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management fee that is provided for in the individual management agreements under which our wholly owned management companies provide property management services (generally the fee is based on a percentage of revenue). On consolidation, the management fee income and expenses are eliminated and the actual cost of providing property management services is recognized.  

(c) In order to derive Same Store- NOI—Adjusted Cash, we adjust Same Store- NOI- GAAP to exclude non-cash items included in our rental income in our GAAP financial statements, including straight line rent adjustments and adjustments related to purchase accounts to reflect leases at fair value at the time of acquisition.  

Same Store Average Occupancy represents the average occupied percentage of the Same Store portfolio for the period.  

Stabilization is defined when a property that was developed has been completed for one year or is 90% occupied. Upon stabilization, a property is moved into our Operating Portfolio.  

Strategic Capital NOI represents strategic capital income less strategic capital expenses.  

Tenant Retention is the square footage of all leases rented by existing tenants divided by the square footage of all expiring and rented leases during the reporting period, excluding the square footage of tenants that default or buy-out prior to expiration of their lease, short-term tenants and the square footage of month-to-month leases. Total Expected Investmentrepresents total estimated(“TEI”) cost of development or expansion, including land, development and leasing costs. TEI is based on current projections and is subject to change. Non-U.S. dollar investments are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at period end or the date of development start for purposes of calculating development starts in any period.  

Turnover Costs represent the costs incurred in connection with the signing of a lease, including leasing commissions and tenant improvements. Tenant improvements include costs to prepare a space for a new tenant and for a lease renewal with the same tenant. It excludes costs to prepare a space that is being leased for the first time (i.e. in a new development property).  

Value-Added Acquisitions are properties we acquire for which we believe the discount in pricing attributed to the operating challenges could provide greater returns post-stabilization than the returns of stabilized properties that are not Value-Added Acquisitions. Value Added Acquisitions must have one or more of the following characteristics: (i) existing vacancy in excess of 20%; (ii) short term lease roll-over, typically during the first two years of ownership; (iii) significant capital improvement requirements in excess of 10% of the purchase price and must be invested within the first two years of ownership.  

Value-Added Conversions represent the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research and development, data center, self storage or manufacturing with the intent to ultimately sell the property once repositioned. Activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use may include such activities as re-zoning, re-designing, re-constructing, and re-tenanting. The economic gain on sales of value added conversions represents the amount by which the sales proceeds exceeds the amount included in NAV for the disposed property.  

Value Creation represents the value that we will create through our development and leasing activities. in We each calculateproperty’s value creation by estimating rental the NOI income that the property without will generate at recurring Stabilization and applying operating an estimated stabilized performance. capitalization rate applicable to that property. The value creation is calculated as the amount by which the estimated value exceeds our total expected investment and does not include any fees or promotes we may earn. This can also include realized economic gains from value-added conversion properties.  

Weighted Average Estimated Stabilized Yield is calculated as NOI assuming stabilized occupancy divided by Acquisition Cost or TEI, as applicable.
