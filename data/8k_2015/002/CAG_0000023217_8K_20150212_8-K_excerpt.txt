Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On February 12, 2015, ConAgra Foods, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release containing information on the Company’s anticipated earnings per share for fiscal 2015. The press release is furnished with this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1  

The press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of diluted earnings per share adjusted for items impacting comparability. Management considers GAAP financial measures as well as such non-GAAP financial information in its evaluation of the Company’s financial statements and believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information to assess the Company’s operating performance and financial position. To the extent required, these measures are reconciled in the press release to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company’s diluted earnings per share measures as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The inability to predict the amount and timing of future items makes a detailed reconciliation of projections of diluted EPS adjusted for items impacting comparability, impracticable.  

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.  

   (d) Exhibits. The following exhibit is furnished herewith:  

Exhibit 99.1 Press Release issued February 12, 2015  

SIGNATURES
