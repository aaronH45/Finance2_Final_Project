Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) hereby incorporates by reference its news release dated January 29, 2015, which is filed as Exhibit 99 hereto. 

Ford will conduct two conference calls on January 29, 2015 to review preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results. Beginning at 9:00 a.m., Ford President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks will host a conference call to discuss Ford’s 2014 fourth quarter and full year results. Investors may access this presentation by dialing 866-318-8614 (or 1-617-399-5133 from outside the United States). The passcode for either telephone number is a verbal response of “Ford Earnings.”

At 11:00 a.m., Ford Vice President and Treasurer Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Controller Stuart Rowley, and Ford Motor Credit Company Chief Financial Officer Mike Seneski will host a conference call focusing on Ford Motor Credit Company’s 2014 fourth quarter results. Investors may access this presentation by dialing 877-415-3177

 (or 1-857-244-7320 from outside the United States). The passcode for either telephone number is a verbal response of “Ford Fixed Income.”

Representatives of the investment community will have the opportunity to ask questions on both conference calls, as will representatives of the news media on the first call.

The presentations (listen-only) and supporting materials will be available at www.shareholder.ford.com. 

Investors also may access replays of the presentations beginning after 12:00 p.m. the day of the event through Friday, February 27, 2015 by dialing 888-286-8010 (or 1-617-801-6888 from outside the United States). The passcode for replays of the earnings call is 20890789; the passcode for replays of the fixed income call is 46648748. All times referenced above are in Eastern Time.

Please note that Exhibit 99 to this Form 8-K discusses various financial measures “excluding special items” and/or with other adjustments. The most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) are these same measures including special items and/or without adjustments. We believe that showing these measures on a basis that excludes special items and/or includes other adjustments is useful to investors, because it allows investors to evaluate our results excluding or adjusting for items related to our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, as well as items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. 

In addition, Exhibit 99 discusses our key cash metrics, Automotive operating-related cash flow (which we believe best represents the ability of our Automotive operations to generate cash), Automotive gross cash (including cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities), and net interest. We believe that Automotive operating-related cash flow is useful to investors because it includes elements that we consider to be related to our operating activities (e.g., capital spending), and excludes cash flow elements that we do not consider to be related to the ability of our operations to generate cash. The most comparable GAAP measure is Cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations on our statement of cash flows. The most comparable GAAP measure for Automotive gross cash is the sum of the individual line items on our balance sheet for each of the elements within that measure (Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities). Net interest primarily measures profit variances driven by changes in our Automotive sector’s centrally managed net interest (primarily interest expense, interest income, and other adjustments). The most comparable GAAP measure for net interest is the sum of Interest expense, interest income, and gains/losses on the majority of our investments which are reported in Automotive interest income and other income/(loss), net on our income statement.
