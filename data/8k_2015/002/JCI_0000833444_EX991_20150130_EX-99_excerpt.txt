CORK, Ireland, January 30, 2015 - Tyco (NYSE: TYC) today reported $0.38 in GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 and diluted EPS from continuing operations before special items of $0.49. Revenue of $2.5 billion in the quarter decreased 1% versus the prior year due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, led by Global Products with a 10% increase. Service revenue grew 1% organically and installation revenue was relatively flat. Acquisitions contributed one percentage point of growth, which was partially offset by the impact of divestitures.

“We are off to a solid start in 2015 with our sixth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings growth,” said Tyco Chief Executive Officer George R. Oliver. “Our teams continue to execute well, with exceptional organic growth of 10% from our products businesses, which drove overall organic revenue growth of 2% and contributed to the 17% increase in earnings per share, year over year. In addition, we committed nearly $1 billion of capital to acquisitions and share repurchases.”

“We are making good progress in transforming our direct channel into a technology solutions provider by expanding our capabilities through organic investments and strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, we appointed Daryll Fogal as our Chief Technology Officer, we launched our new ‘Tyco On’ software solutions platform and completed or signed five acquisitions focused on key areas of growth for Tyco, including gas and flame detection, growth markets, and expanding our services platform. These acquisitions accelerate our strategic priorities, with a focus on technology that enables innovative solutions to uniquely address customer problems utilizing our direct channel,” continued Mr. Oliver.

"While we continue to deliver strong operating performance, the sustained strengthening of the U.S. dollar is putting additional pressure on our results. Based on current exchange rates, we have an incremental $0.09 of foreign currency headwinds on top of the $0.07 we had expected when we gave 2015 guidance in November. We are able to partially offset this incremental headwind with the benefit of recent acquisitions and additional productivity. As a result, we are updating our full year EPS guidance to a range of $2.30 to $2.40 before special items, which at the midpoint would represent an 18% year-over-year improvement," Mr. Oliver added.

Organic revenue, free cash flow, operating income, segment operating income, and diluted EPS from continuing operations before special items are non-GAAP financial measures and are described below. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, see the attached tables. Additional schedules as well as first quarter review slides can be found in the Investor Relations section of Tyco’s website at http://investors.tyco.com.

SEGMENT RESULTS 

The financial results presented in the tables below are in accordance with GAAP unless otherwise indicated. All dollar amounts are pre-tax and stated in millions. In fiscal year 2014, certain businesses were classified as discontinued operations. The revenue and operating income results shown below have been adjusted to reflect these changes in all periods presented. All comparisons are to the fiscal first quarter of 2014 unless otherwise indicated.

North America Installation & Services

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue of $951 million decreased 1% due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar. Organic growth in service revenue of 1% was offset by a decline in installation revenue of 1%. Backlog of $2.5 billion increased 5% year over year and 1% on a quarter sequential basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency.

Operating income for the quarter was $105 million and the operating margin was 11.0%. Special items of $26 million consisted primarily of restructuring charges. Before special items, operating income was $131 million and the operating margin was 13.8%. Improved execution and the benefit of restructuring and productivity initiatives were partially offset by a legal charge, which negatively impacted the operating margin by 60 basis points.

Rest of World Installation & Services

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue of $917 million decreased 6% compared to the prior year, driven by a 7% unfavorable impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic revenue growth was relatively flat with a modest increase in both service and installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 2% to revenue growth, which was partially offset by the impact of divestitures. Backlog of $2.1 billion increased 2% on a year over year and quarter sequential basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency.

Operating income for the quarter was $69 million and the operating margin was 7.5%. Special items of $21 million consisted primarily of restructuring charges. Before special items, operating income was $90 million, and the operating margin declined 80 basis points to 9.8%, primarily due to the mix of businesses contributing to growth and a lower percentage of higher-margin service revenue. 

Global Products

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue of $611 million increased 8% in the quarter. Organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by strong growth across all three platforms, led by Security Products and Life Safety Products. Organic growth included a 2 percentage point benefit from increased shipments of Scott Safety Air-Pak X3s compared to the prior year. Acquisitions contributed an additional point of growth, which was more than offset by a 3% decrease related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Operating income for the quarter was $98 million and the operating margin was 16.0%. Special items of $7 million consisted primarily of restructuring charges. Before special items, operating income was $105 million and the operating margin increased 130 basis points to 17.2%. Operating leverage on increased revenue, favorable product mix and productivity benefits drove the operating margin improvement.

OTHER ITEMS

•Cash from operating activities was $96 million and free cash flow was $4 million, which included a cash outflow of $38 million, primarily related to restructuring and repositioning activities. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $42 million. The company completed the quarter with $473 million in cash and cash equivalents.

•Corporate expense for the quarter was $55 million before special items and $74 million on a GAAP basis, primarily due to restructuring and repositioning charges.

•As previously disclosed, during the quarter the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Industrial Safety Technologies (IST), a global leader in gas and flame detection, for $329.5 million in cash. On an annualized basis, the addition of IST to Tyco's Global Products segment is expected to generate approximately $140 million in revenue. This transaction is expected to close toward the end of the fiscal second quarter.

•During the quarter, the company completed four additional acquisitions for a total of $140 million in cash. These included the acquisitions of a thermal imaging business, a fire suppression products business in China, a fire and security service business in the U.K, and a majority investment in an interactive intrusion platform that expands the company's Internet of Things capabilities.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

Organic revenue, free cash flow (outflow) (FCF), and income from continuing operations, earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations, operating income and segment operating income, in each case “before special items,” are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.

Organic revenue is a useful measure used by the company to measure the underlying results and trends in the business. The difference between reported net revenue (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic revenue (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and other changes that either do not reflect the underlying results and trends of the Company’s businesses or are not completely under management’s control. There are limitations associated with organic revenue, such as the fact that, as presented herein, the metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. These limitations are best addressed by using organic revenue in combination with the GAAP numbers. Organic revenue may be used as a component in the company’s incentive compensation plans.

FCF is a useful measure of the company's cash that permits management and investors to gain insight into the number that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation and is available to service debt and make investments. The difference between Cash Flows from Operating Activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and FCF (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash flows that the company believes are useful to identify. It, or a measure that is based on it, may be used as a component in the company's incentive compensation plans. The difference reflects the impact from:

•net capital expenditures,

•dealer generated accounts and bulk accounts purchased,

•cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities, and

•voluntary pension contributions.

Capital expenditures and dealer generated and bulk accounts purchased are subtracted because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities. Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities is subtracted because these cash outflows are not available for general corporate uses. Voluntary pension contributions are added because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. In addition, the company presents adjusted free cash flow, which is free cash flow, adjusted to exclude the cash impact of the special items highlighted below. This number provides information to investors regarding the cash impact of certain items management believes are useful to identify, as described below.

The limitation associated with using these cash flow metrics is that they adjust for cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and therefore may imply that there is less or more cash that is available for the company's programs than the most comparable GAAP measure. Furthermore, these non-GAAP metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. These limitations are best addressed by using FCF in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.

The company has presented its income and EPS from continuing operations, operating income and segment operating income before special items. Special items include charges and gains related to divestitures, acquisitions, restructurings, impairments, certain changes to accounting methodologies, legacy legal and tax charges and other income or charges that may mask the underlying operating results and/or business trends of the company or business segment, as applicable. The company utilizes these measures to assess overall operating performance and segment level core operating performance, as well as to provide insight to management in evaluating overall and segment operating plan execution and underlying market conditions. The Company also presents its effective tax rate as adjusted for special items for consistency, and presents corporate expense excluding special items. One or more of these measures may be used as components in the company's incentive compensation plans. These measures are useful for investors because they may permit more meaningful comparisons of the company's underlying operating results and business trends between periods. The difference between income and EPS from continuing operations before special items and income and EPS from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure. The limitation of these measures is that they exclude the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease the company's reported GAAP metrics, and these non-GAAP metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. These limitations are best addressed by using the non-GAAP measures in combination with the most comparable GAAP measures in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results. 

The company provides general corporate services to its segments and those costs are reported in the "Corporate and Other" segment. This segment's operating income (loss) is presented as "Corporate Expense." Segment Operating Income represents Tyco’s operating income excluding the Corporate and Other segment, and reflects the results of Tyco’s three operating segments. Segment Operating Income before special items reflects GAAP operating income adjusted for the special items noted in the paragraph above.
