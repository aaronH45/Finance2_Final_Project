        "(a) These financial measures for the thirteen and fifty-three weeks ended January 3, 2015 have been reported on a GAAP basis which includes the impact of a 53rd week of operations, BWP integration costs of $0.8 million and $9.0 million, respectively, General Parts integration costs of $36.0 million and $73.2 million, respectively, and General Parts amortization of acquired intangible assets of $9.9 million and $42.7 million, respectively. These financial measures for the twelve and fifty-two weeks ended December 28, 2013 have been reported on a GAAP basis which includes transaction expenses related to our General Parts acquisition of $21.9 million and $27.0 million, respectively, and the impact of BWP integration costs of $3.1 million and $8.0 million, respectively. Included in the transaction costs in each period presented is $2.0 million that is classified as interest expense. These financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial measures presented on a comparable basis earlier in this press release. Management believes the reporting of financial results on a non-GAAP basis to remain comparable is important in assessing the overall performance of the business and is therefore useful for investors and prospective investors."
