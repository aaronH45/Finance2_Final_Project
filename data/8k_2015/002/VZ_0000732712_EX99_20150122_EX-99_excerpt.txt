NEW YORK – Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) today reported a healthy quarter of high-quality wireless connections growth, and customer and revenue growth for fiber-optic broadband services.  

Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam said: “Verizon posted another year of consistently high operating and financial performance in 2014, with strong cash generation and the return of $7.8 billion to our shareowners. I am confident that Verizon’s assets and market momentum position us to continue to drive profitable growth in 2015.”  

Due to the impact of non-operational items, Verizon reported a loss of 54 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2014, compared with a gain of $1.76 in EPS in fourth-quarter 2013.  

On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), Verizon reported a gain of 71 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2014, a 7.6 percent increase compared with adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2013.
