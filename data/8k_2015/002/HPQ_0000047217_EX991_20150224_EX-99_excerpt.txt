    earnings and non-GAAP diluted net EPS exclude after-tax costs of $339 million and $0.19 per diluted share, respectively, related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, separation costs, and acquisition-related charges.   

    “With the first quarter of fiscal 2015 now behind us, the HP turnaround remains on track,” said Meg Whitman, chairman, president and chief executive officer, HP. “We grew operating profit margins across all of our major business segments, increased investment in innovation, and executed well across key areas of our portfolio and in our separation activities. Our progress continues as we head into Q2.”   

    Outlook   

   The US dollar has strengthened considerably since HP last provided an FY15 outlook in November, 2014. As is the case with many US based companies, this currency challenge is having a significant impact on HP’s financial outlook.  

   For the fiscal 2015 second quarter, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88, reflecting an estimated currency impact of $0.09. HP expects GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.61, reflecting an estimated currency impact of $0.09. Fiscal 2015 second quarter non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax costs of approximately $0.27 per share, related to separation costs, the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges.   

   For fiscal 2015, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.73, reflecting an estimated currency impact of $0.30. Absent the impact of currency, the range is in line with HP’s prior forecast. HP expects GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $2.03 to $2.23, reflecting an estimated currency impact of $0.30. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude after-tax costs of approximately $1.50 per share, related to separation costs, the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges.  

   “While we were able to manage the impact of currency in the quarter and deliver earnings as expected, we believe the impact on FY15 will be significantly greater than we anticipated in November,” Whitman added. “We’ll work hard to offset these impacts through re-pricing and productivity, but fully mitigating currency movements of this size would require reducing investments and mortgaging our future. We won’t do that.”  

   Asset management  

   HP generated $744 million in cash flow from operations in the first quarter, down 75% from the prior-year period. Inventory ended the quarter at $6.6 billion, up 4 days year over year to 29 days. Accounts receivable ended the quarter at $12.3 billion, down 2 days year over year to 41 days. Accounts payable ended the quarter at $14.9 billion, up 13 days year over year to 65 days. HP’s dividend payment of $0.16 per share in the first quarter resulted in cash usage of $304 million. HP also utilized $1.6 billion of cash during the quarter to repurchase approximately 41.1 million shares of common stock in the open market. HP exited the quarter with $13.3 billion in gross cash.

 (a)  Effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2015, HP implemented an organizational change to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. This organizational change resulted in the transfer of third party multi-vendor support arrangements from the Technology Services business unit within the Enterprise Group segment to the Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing business unit within the Enterprise Services segment. HP reflected this change to its segment information in prior reporting periods on an as-if basis, which resulted in the removal of intersegment revenue from the Technology Services business unit within the Enterprise Group segment and the related corporate intersegment revenue eliminations, and the transfer of operating profit from the Technology Services business unit within the Enterprise Group segment to the Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing business unit within the Enterprise Services segment. This change had no impact on HP’s previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share.

   Use of non-GAAP financial measures  

   To supplement HP’s consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, HP provides revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, gross cash, free cash flow, net capital expenditures, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash. HP also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share.  

   These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating margin is operating margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to gross cash is cash and cash equivalents. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net capital expenditures is capital expenditures. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net debt and operating company net debt is total company debt. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to each of net cash and operating company net cash is cash and cash equivalents. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.  

   Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures used by HP  

   Revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP operating margin are defined to exclude the effects of any charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, charges relating to the separation transaction and acquisition-related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges. In addition, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. HP’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating HP’s historical and prospective financial performance, as well as HP’s performance relative to its competitors. HP’s management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of HP’s segment operating performance. HP believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows HP’s management to better understand HP’s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of HP’s segments, as HP’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. More specifically, HP’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:  

   • HP incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets. Those charges are included in HP’s GAAP earnings from operations, operating margin, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of HP’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges. Consequently, HP excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of HP’s current operating performance and comparisons to HP’s operating performance in other periods.  

   • Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to (i) employee termination costs and benefits and (ii) costs to vacate duplicative facilities. HP excludes these restructuring costs (and any reversals of charges recorded in prior periods) for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures because it believes that these historical costs do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of HP’s current operating performance or comparisons to HP’s operating performance in other periods.  

Page 14 of 16 

   • Separation costs are expenses associated with HP’s plan to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies. The charges are related primarily to third-party consulting fees and other expenses incurred to complete the separation. HP excludes these separation costs for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of HP’s current operating performance and comparisons to HP’s operating performance in other periods.  

   • HP incurs costs related to its acquisitions. As acquisition-related expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of HP’s acquisitions, HP believes that eliminating these expenses for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of HP’s current operating performance and comparisons to HP’s operating performance in other periods.  

   Gross cash is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and certain long-term investments that may be liquidated within 90 days pursuant to the terms of existing put options or similar rights. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures is defined as investments in property, plant and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. HP’s management uses gross cash and free cash flow for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in HP’s businesses, funding acquisitions, repurchasing stock and other purposes. HP’s management also uses gross cash and free cash flow to evaluate HP’s historical and prospective liquidity. Because gross cash includes liquid assets that are not included in GAAP cash and cash equivalents, HP believes that gross cash provides a more accurate and complete assessment of HP’s liquidity. Because net capital expenditures includes proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, HP believes that net capital expenditures provides a more accurate and complete assessment of HP’s liquidity. Because free cash flow includes the effect of net capital expenditures that are not reflected in GAAP cash flow from operations, HP believes that free cash flow provides a more accurate and complete assessment of HP’s liquidity and capital resources.   

   Total company net debt consists of total debt (including the effects of hedging) less gross cash, which includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and certain liquid long-term investments. Total company net cash consists of gross cash less total debt. HP Financial Services (HPFS) net debt consists of HPFS debt, which includes primarily intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and borrowing and funding related activity associated with HPFS and its subsidiaries, less HPFS cash. Total company net debt and total company net cash provide useful information to HP’s management about the state of HP’s consolidated condensed balance sheet. Operating company net debt is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as total company net debt less HPFS net debt. Operating company net cash is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as total company net cash less HPFS net debt. Operating company net debt and operating company net cash provide additional useful information to HP’s management about the state of HP’s consolidated condensed balance sheet by providing more transparency into the financial components of the operating company separate from HP’s financing business, which has different capital structure requirements and requires much greater leverage to run effectively.

   Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures  

   These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of HP’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are:  

   • Items such as amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting HP’s cash position, represent the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is not included in non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings or non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and therefore does not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of those intangible assets.  

   • Items such as restructuring charges and separation costs that are excluded from non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure and cash flows.  

   • HP may not be able to immediately liquidate the short-term and long-term investments included in gross cash, which may limit the usefulness of gross cash as a liquidity measure.  

   • Other companies may calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, gross cash, free cash flow, net capital expenditures, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash differently than HP does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.  

   Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures  

   HP compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. HP also provides robust and detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and HP encourages investors to review carefully those reconciliations.  

   Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors  

   HP believes that providing revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, gross cash, free cash flow, net capital expenditures, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash to investors in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by HP’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see HP’s results “through the eyes” of management. HP further believes that providing this information better enables HP’s investors to understand HP’s operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by HP’s management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of HP’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in HP’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.
