Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On January 19, 2015, the Board of Directors of Hanesbrands Inc. (the “Company”) increased the number of members of the Board of Directors from ten to eleven and elected Franck J. Moison to serve as a director of the Company. The election of Mr. Moison is effective immediately, and he will serve until the Company’s next annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor is elected and qualified, or until his resignation or removal. 

Mr. Moison’s compensation will be consistent with the Company’s standard compensatory arrangements for non-employee directors and for 2015 will consist of: (i) an annual cash retainer of $90,000, paid in quarterly installments; (ii) an annual grant of restricted stock units with a grant date fair value of approximately $125,000 that vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date and are payable upon vesting in shares of Hanesbrands common stock; and (iii) reimbursement of customary expenses for attending board of directors, committee and stockholder meetings. 

Other than the standard compensation arrangements described above, there are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Moison and any other person pursuant to which he was elected as a director. The Company is not aware of any transaction with Mr. Moison that would require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. 

The press release issued by the Company announcing Mr. Moison’s election is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
