Clawback Policy  

On February 10, 2015, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Prudential Financial, Inc. (the “Company”) adopted the Prudential Financial, Inc. Clawback Policy effective February 10, 2015.  

The new clawback policy covers all executive officers and applies to all incentive-based compensation (including stock options and other equity awards) paid to or in respect of an executive officer. The policy provides that if (i) the Company is required to undertake a material restatement of any financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or (ii) an executive officer engages in improper conduct (including a failure to report) that either has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a significant adverse reputational or economic impact on the Company or any of its affiliates or divisions, then the Board may, in its sole discretion, after evaluating the associated costs and benefits, seek to recover all or any portion of the incentive-based compensation paid to any such executive officer during the three year period preceding the restatement, or the occurrence of the improper conduct, as the case may be.  

The policy also requires the Company to disclose to its shareholders not later than the filing of the next following proxy statement the action taken by the Board, or the Board’s decision not to take action, with regard to compensation recovery following a material restatement or improper conduct, so long as such event has been previously disclosed in the Company’s filings with the SEC.  

The policy is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
