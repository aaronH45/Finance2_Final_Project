On February 24, 2015, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of MetLife, Inc. (the “Company”) elected Edward J. Kelly, III, a director of the Company, effective immediately.

Mr. Kelly will participate in the non-management director compensation arrangements described in the Company’s 2014 proxy statement. Under the terms of those arrangements, non-management directors receive an annual retainer of $260,000 per year, 50% of which will be paid in shares of the Company’s common stock and 50% of which will be paid in cash. Each annual retainer covers the period of Board service commencing at the Company’s annual shareholders meeting and ending at its next annual shareholders meeting. For the period beginning at his election to the Board and ending at the 2015 annual shareholders meeting, Mr. Kelly will receive a prorated retainer fee to reflect such period of service.
