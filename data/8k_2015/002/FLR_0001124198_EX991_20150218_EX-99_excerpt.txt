FLUOR REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2014 RESULTS 

· 2014 EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $4.48 

· RECORD NEW AWARDS OF $28.8 BILLION 

· BACKLOG UP 22 PERCENT TO $42.5 BILLION 

· RETURNED OVER $1 BILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS IN 2014 

IRVING, TEXAS — February 18, 2015 — Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) today announced financial results for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations for 2014 were $715 million, or $4.48 per diluted share, up from $668 million or $4.06 per diluted share in 2013. Consolidated segment profit for the year was $1.3 billion, compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. Segment profit results for 2014 reflect an improvement in Oil & Gas, offset by declines in the Industrial & Infrastructure, Government and Global Services segments. Revenue of $21.5 billion in 2014 was down from $27.4 billion in the prior year, mainly due to reductions from the Industrial & Infrastructure segment’s mining and metals business line. 

Full year new awards were a record $28.8 billion, comprised of $19.7 billion in Oil & Gas, $4.7 billion in Government, $3.3 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure and $1.1 billion in Power. This compares to $25.1 billion in new awards in 2013. Consolidated backlog at year-end was $42.5 billion, which compares with $34.9 billion a year ago, reflecting growth in both the Oil & Gas and Government segments. 

“Our performance in 2014 was strong, with record new awards and an ending backlog of over $42 billion going into 2015,” said Fluor Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Seaton. “Although we continue to track a robust prospect list across a number of end markets and geographies, the short-term impact of oil prices and the timing of major capital investment decisions by our customers create uncertainty.” 

Corporate G&A expense for 2014 was $183 million, compared with $175 million a year ago. Fluor’s cash and marketable securities balance remains strong at $2.4 billion. During 2014, the Company generated $643 million in cash flow from operating activities, repurchased $906 million worth of Fluor shares, and paid out $126 million in dividends. During the fourth quarter the Company issued $500 million in senior notes and implemented a plan to repurchase $1 billion of shares, including approximately $500 million repurchased in the fourth quarter. 

Outlook 

Although we continue to closely monitor the capital spending plans of our major oil and gas clients, at this point in time we believe effects from slower spending by our customers on our earnings per share guidance will be significantly offset by the positive effects of our announced share repurchase program. However, we believe the upper half of the range, while still achievable, has become more challenging. As a result, the company is expanding its 2015 guidance range to $4.40 to $5.00 per diluted share, which compares to the previous range of $4.50 to $5.00 per diluted share. This guidance excludes the effects of the previously announced termination and settlement of Fluor’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan later in 2015.

Business Segments 

Fluor’s Oil & Gas business reported segment profit of $673 million in 2014, an increase from $441 million in 2013. Revenue for 2014 was $11.4 billion, compared with $11.5 billion in the previous year. The segment’s strong operating results reflect increased contributions from upstream and petrochemical projects. Full year new awards in 2014 totaled $19.7 billion, compared to $12.9 billion in 2013. In the fourth quarter, the segment booked new awards of $4.9 billion, including a petrochemical facility for Sasol in the United States and a delayed coker unit for Pemex in Mexico. Ending backlog for the Oil & Gas segment rose 42 percent from a year ago to end 2014 at a record $28.4 billion. 

The Industrial & Infrastructure group reported segment profit of $391 million, down from $476 million in 2013. Total 2014 revenue for the segment declined 45 percent to $6.1 billion from $11.1 billion a year ago. Results for the year reflect lower contributions from the mining and metals business line. Full year new awards in 2014 totaled $3.3 billion, down from $6.6 billion in 2013. New awards in the fourth quarter were $712 million including the A9 Holendrecht - Diemen road project in the Netherlands. Year-end backlog declined to $7.3 billion, from $10.5 billion a year ago reflecting reduced mining and metals new award activity in the year. 

The Government group reported segment profit of $93 million, compared to $161 million a year ago. Segment profit in 2013 included unusually large nonrecurring contributions from the favorable resolution of several issues that spanned multiple years. Segment profit in 2014 reflects reduced task order activities associated with the LOGCAP IV contract in Afghanistan. Revenue for 2014 was $2.5 billion, compared to $2.7 billion a year ago. New awards totaled $4.7 billion

for the year, compared with $4.1 billion in 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 new awards totaled $157 million and ending backlog was $4.7 billion. 

Segment profit for Global Services was $74 million in 2014, compared to $120 million a year ago. Revenue for the year declined slightly from $612 million in 2013 to $585 million in 2014. Lower results for the year were mainly driven by reductions in the equipment business line’s mining-related activities and the withdrawal of equipment from Afghanistan. 

Segment profit for the Power group was $31 million for 2014, up from $12 million a year ago primarily due to the substantial progress made on two gas-fired power plants. Segment revenue for the year decreased 28 percent to $1.0 billion, compared with $1.4 billion a year ago, due to lower contributions from solar and gas-fired projects nearing completion. New awards in 2014 were $1.1 billion, compared with $1.5 billion a year ago. Fourth quarter new awards were $528 million, including a nuclear power plant maintenance services contract in California. Ending backlog was $2.1 billion, which compares with $2.0 billion a year ago. 

Fourth Quarter Results 

Net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $220 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, which compares to $167 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in 2013. The effective tax rate of 23 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 was lower than normal primarily due to the favorable resolution of tax audit issues. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2013 was approximately 31 percent and included benefits from research and development tax credits and a domestic production activities deduction, which were partly offset by the adverse tax effect from a foreign loss without a tax benefit. Current quarter 

4 

segment profit was $346 million compared to $318 million a year ago and included improved contributions from the Oil & Gas and Power segments. Results in the fourth quarter of 2013 included unusually large nonrecurring contributions related to the favorable resolution of several issues that spanned multiple years in the Government segment. Corporate G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $53 million, compared with $65 million reported a year ago. This improvement is mainly attributable to changes in stock price-driven compensation expenses. Revenue for the quarter was $5.5 billion, which compares with $6.3 billion last year, mainly due to the completion of a number of mining and metals projects within the Industrial & Infrastructure segment and upstream projects in the Oil & Gas segment. Fourth quarter new awards were $6.3 billion, and ending backlog was $42.5 billion. 

Discontinued Operations 

In October 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with counsel for a number of plaintiffs who had filed lawsuits against the Company relating to the Doe Run lead business, which the Company sold in 1994. During the fourth quarter the Company recorded an additional after-tax charge of approximately $6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share from discontinued operations. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the after-tax charge from discontinued operations was approximately $205 million, or $1.28 per diluted share. In January 2015, the Company paid approximately $300 million pursuant to the settlement agreement. The Company continues to seek to enforce its rights to indemnification from the buyer pursuant to the terms of the 1994 sale agreement.
