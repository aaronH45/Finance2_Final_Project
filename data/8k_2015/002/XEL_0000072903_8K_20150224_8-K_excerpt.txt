Item 8.01. Other Events

In 2014, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed an electric rate case with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) requesting an increase in annual revenue of approximately $136.0 million, or 4.83 percent. The requested 2015 rate increase reflected approximately $100.9 million (subsequently updated to $98.7 million) for recovery of costs associated with the Clean Air Clean Jobs Act (CACJA) project. The case also requested the initiation of a CACJA rider for 2016 and 2017, which was anticipated to increase revenue recovery by approximately $34.2 million in 2016 and then decline to approximately $29.9 million in 2017. The rate filing was based on a 2015 forecast test year, a requested return on equity (ROE) of 10.35 percent, an electric rate base of $6.39 billion and an equity ratio of 56 percent. As part of the filing, PSCo would transfer approximately $19.9 million from the transmission rider to base rates, which would not impact customer bills. The rider would recover incremental investment and expenses associated with the CACJA project to retire certain coal plants, add pollution control equipment to other existing coal units and add natural gas generation.

In November 2014, several parties filed answer testimony, including the CPUC Staff (Staff) and the Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC). The Staff’s position was based on an ROE of 9.11 percent and a 51.24 percent equity ratio. In addition, the Staff proposed that costs associated with the CACJA project be recovered through a rider mechanism. The OCC recommended an ROE of 9.10 percent, a 52.70 percent equity ratio and that a portion of the costs associated with the CACJA project be recovered in base rates and the remainder through a rider mechanism.

In December 2014, PSCo filed rebuttal testimony, revising its requested rate increase to $107.2 million, or 3.79 percent, reflecting an ROE of 10.25 percent and updated information for both the sales and property tax forecasts. PSCo also proposed to recover all costs associated with the CACJA project through the rider beginning in 2015.

In January 2015, PSCo and intervenors filed a comprehensive settlement agreement, subject to CPUC approval, which would result in an overall 2015 revenue increase of approximately $53.3 million, or 1.87 percent. Key terms of the agreement include the following:

•The settlement is based on a 2013 historic test year (HTY), an ROE of 9.83 percent and an equity ratio of 56 percent; 

•It includes the implementation of a forward-looking CACJA rider, effective Jan. 1, 2015, a forward-looking transmission cost adjustment (TCA) rider, effective Feb. 13, 2015 and tracking mechanisms for pension expense and property taxes; and 

•The agreement also includes an earnings test for 2015 through 2017, under which PSCo and customers would share in any earnings on a 50/50 basis if the ROE recognized falls between 9.84 percent and 10.48 percent. The earnings test principles are based primarily on those established in the previous rate case.

The Staff and OCC’s recommendations, PSCo’s rebuttal testimony and the terms of the settlement agreement are summarized as follows:

In addition to the revenue reflected in the table above, PSCo estimates that it will defer approximately $3.1 million of additional expenses in 2015 as a result of the settlement.

In its original rate case request, PSCo proposed to shorten the depreciable lives for certain assets, which would have resulted in a material increase in depreciation expense. As a result of the settlement, PSCo will not implement the depreciation changes, but will instead file a standalone case to address depreciation, amortization and decommissioning in early 2016. The results of the depreciation case will become effective as part of the 2018 electric rate case.

Settlement rates became effective Feb. 13, 2015 on an interim basis, subject to refund. On Feb. 24, 2015, the CPUC approved the settlement agreement without modification.
