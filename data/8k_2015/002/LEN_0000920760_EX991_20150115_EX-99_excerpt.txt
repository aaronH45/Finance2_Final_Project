Miami, January 15, 2015 -- Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B), one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2014. Fourth quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2014 were $245.3 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $164.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2013. Net earnings attributable to Lennar for the year ended November 30, 2014 were $638.9 million, or $2.80 per diluted share, compared to $479.7 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, for the year ended November 30, 2013.

Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, “As the housing market has continued its slow but steady recovery, we are extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results, as we achieved a 50% and 33% year-over-year increase in net earnings, respectively. The recovery has been, and will continue to be, driven forward by years of production deficit that has limited supply in both the “for sale” and “for rent” markets, while it has been constrained by reduced access to credit availability.”

Mr. Miller continued, “While a number of macroeconomic factors have contributed to ongoing choppiness in the recovery, with more pressure on sales prices and gross margins, we remain optimistic about the continuation of the recovery based on the following factors:

•Recent changes to down payments, guaranty fees and underwriting standards articulated by FHFA and HUD

•Consumer stimulus provided by lower gasoline prices

•Greater affordability driven by lower interest rates

•General improvements seen in the national employment environment.

Our core homebuilding business continues its industry-leading execution with gross margins and operating margins of 25.6% and 16.0% in our fourth quarter, respectively. New orders in the quarter rose 22% and deliveries increased 23% over the prior year, with increases in each of our reporting regions. Our sales backlog dollar value increased 22% from last year to approximately $2.0 billion, providing an excellent foundation going forward.

In fiscal 2015, despite slightly lower gross margins, our core homebuilding business is well positioned to deliver strong top and bottom-line growth throughout the year.

Complementing our homebuilding business, our Financial Services segment’s earnings for the quarter increased 78% from 2013 to $30.2 million. Rialto’s investment management and commercial lending businesses had another quarter of strong earnings. During the fourth quarter, Rialto generated $38.2 million of earnings, which included the receipt of a $34.7 million advanced distribution with regard to its carried interest in Rialto Real Estate Fund I. In addition, our Multifamily business continues to mature with a pipeline of over $5 billion, and we anticipate a significant contribution from this segment starting in late 2015.”

3-3-3

Mr. Miller concluded, “While our homebuilding business continues to be the primary driver of our quarterly earnings, we are extremely well positioned across all of our platforms. Overall, we anticipate another year of substantial profitability in 2015, as the housing market continues its slow and steady progression.”

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2014 COMPARED TO 

THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2013

Lennar Homebuilding

Revenues from home sales increased 32% in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $2.3 billion from $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 23% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities and a 7% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 6,948 homes in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 5,639 homes in the fourth quarter of 2013. There was an increase in home deliveries in all of the Company's Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $329,000 in the fourth quarter of 2014 from $307,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $23,100 per home delivered in the fourth quarter of 2014, or 6.6% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $20,600 per home delivered in the same period last year, or 6.3% as a percentage of home sales revenue. 

Gross margins on home sales were $584.4 million, or 25.6%, in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $465.0 million, or 26.8%, in the fourth quarter of 2013. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in materials, labor and land costs and an increase in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenue from home sales, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered and $5.8 million of Chinese drywall settlements. Gross profits on land sales totaled $15.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $8.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $218.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $172.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014, from 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to improved operating leverage.

Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities was ($3.7) million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities included $4.3 million of the Company's share of a valuation adjustment related to assets of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, partially offset by the Company's share of operating earnings of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities.

4-4-4

Lennar Homebuilding other income, net totaled $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $13.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Lennar Homebuilding other income, net included the sale of a rental operating property by one of our consolidated joint ventures that resulted in a gain of $14.4 million (the transaction resulted in a net loss of $3.2 million after considering the impact of noncontrolling interests totaling $17.6 million).

Lennar Homebuilding interest expense was $60.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 ($53.7 million was included in cost of homes sold, $1.0 million in cost of land sold and $5.2 million in other interest expense), compared to $58.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 ($37.8 million was included in cost of homes sold, $0.5 million in cost of land sold and $20.5 million in other interest expense). The increase in interest expense is primarily related to an increase in interest expense included in cost of homes sold due to an increase in the Company's outstanding debt and an increase in home deliveries. This was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense included in other interest expense due to an increase in qualifying assets eligible for interest capitalization.

Lennar Financial Services

Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment were $30.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $17.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in profitability was primarily due to higher volume and higher profit per transaction in the segment's mortgage and title operations.

Rialto

Operating earnings for the Rialto segment were $38.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 (which included $36.4 million of operating earnings and an add back of $1.8 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to operating earnings of $13.9 million (which included $15.6 million of operating earnings offset by $1.7 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests) in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Revenues in this segment were $88.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to revenues of $58.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Revenues increased primarily due to the receipt of a $34.7 million advanced distribution with regard to Rialto's carried interest in Rialto Real Estate Fund, LP (“Fund I”) in order to cover the income tax obligation which resulted from allocations of taxable income to Rialto’s general partner interest. This was partially offset by a decrease in securitization revenue and interest income from Rialto Mortgage Finance (“RMF”) and a decrease in interest income associated with Rialto’s portfolio of real estate loans. 

Expenses in this segment were $74.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to expenses of $56.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in loan impairments of $10.3 million primarily due to the change from the accretable yield income method to a cost recovery basis method on Rialto's portfolio of real estate loans. The Company made this determination in order to better reflect the performance of the loan portfolios due to the uncertainty in estimating the timing and amount of future cash flows.

5-5-5

In addition, expenses increased due to an increase in interest expense and other general administrative expenses, partially offset by a decrease in RMF securitization expenses. 

Rialto equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $16.0 million and $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to the Company’s share of earnings from the Rialto real estate funds. The higher equity in earnings related to increases in fair value and recognition of gains related to certain assets in the Rialto real estate funds.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, Rialto other income, net was $6.4 million, which consisted primarily of $15.8 million of net realized gains on the sale of real estate owned ("REO") and rental and other income, partially offset by expenses related to owning and maintaining REO, $8.8 million of impairments on REO and other expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Rialto other income, net was $7.0 million, which consisted primarily of $11.9 million of net realized gains on the sale of REO, a gain of $8.5 million related to a bargain purchase acquisition, which involved cash and a loan receivable as consideration, and rental income, partially offset by expenses related to owning and maintaining REO and $6.2 million of impairments on REO.

Lennar Multifamily

Operating loss for the Lennar Multifamily segment was $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, operating loss primarily related to general and administrative expenses, partially offset by management fee income. 

Corporate General and Administrative Expenses

Corporate general and administrative expenses were $57.7 million, or 2.2% as a percentage of total revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $43.3 million, or 2.3% as a percentage of total revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2013. As a percentage of revenue, corporate general and administrative expenses improved due to increased operating leverage.

Noncontrolling Interests

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were $7.3 million and $18.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the fourth quarter of 2014 were primarily attributable to a strategic transaction by one of Lennar Homebuilding's consolidated joint ventures that impacted noncontrolling interests by $5.6 million. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the fourth quarter of 2013 were primarily attributable to a transaction by one of the Company's consolidated joint ventures that impacted noncontrolling interests by $17.6 million.

6-6-6

Debt Transactions

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company issued $350 million of 4.50% senior notes due November 2019. The net proceeds of the sales will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Lennar Homebuilding

Revenues from home sales increased 29% in the year ended November 30, 2014 to $6.8 billion from $5.3 billion in 2013.

Gross profits on land sales totaled $41.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2014, compared to $17.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2013.

Lennar Financial Services

Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment were $80.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2014, compared to $85.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2013. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to a more competitive environment as a result of a significant decrease in refinance transactions, which resulted in lower profit per transaction in the segment's mortgage operations.

Rialto

Operating earnings for the Rialto segment were $66.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2014 (which included $44.1 million of operating earnings and an add back of $22.5 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to operating earnings of $19.9 million (which included $26.1 million of operating earnings, partially offset by $6.2 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests) in the year ended November 30, 2013.

revenues increased due to an increase in securitization revenue and interest income from RMF, partially offset by a decrease in interest income associated with Rialto’s portfolio of real estate loans.

Expenses in this segment were $249.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2014, compared to expenses of $151.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2013. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in loan impairments of $41.0 million due to changes in estimated cash flows expected to be collected on the segment’s loan portfolios and the change from the accretable yield income method to a cost recovery basis method. In addition, expenses increased due to an increase in interest expense and other general administrative expenses. 

Rialto equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $59.3 million and $22.4 million in the years ended November 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to the Company's share of earnings from the Rialto real estate funds.

(3)EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as earnings before interest and taxes. This financial measure has been presented because the Company finds it important and useful in evaluating its performance and believes that it helps readers of the Company's financial statements compare its operations with those of its competitors. Although management finds EBIT to be an important measure in conducting and evaluating the Company's operations, this measure has limitations as an analytical tool as it is not reflective of the actual profitability generated by the Company during the period. Management compensates for the limitations of using EBIT by using this non-GAAP measure only to supplement the Company's GAAP results. Due to the limitations discussed, EBIT should not be viewed in isolation, as it is not a substitute for GAAP measures.

(1)Net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net Lennar Homebuilding debt (Lennar Homebuilding debt less Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net Lennar Homebuilding debt plus stockholders' equity). The Company believes the ratio of net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in the Company's Lennar Homebuilding operations. However, because net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement the Company's GAAP results.
