   Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.    

  General Mills, Inc. is currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring initiatives designed to increase efficiency and focus on key growth strategies. Our previously announced Project Century is a review of our North American manufacturing and distribution network to streamline operations and identify potential capacity reductions, with a goal of delivering annual savings of $100 million by the end of fiscal 2017. As part of this project, we announced on January 8, 2015 our intentions to reduce our refrigerated dough capacity and exit our Midland, Ontario, Canada and New Albany, Indiana facilities, which support our U.S. Retail, International and Convenience Stores and Foodservice supply chains.

The Midland action will affect approximately 100 positions and we expect to record restructuring charges of approximately $21 million, of which approximately $12 will be cash. These restructuring charges include approximately $10 million of severance expense, $8 million of asset write-offs, and $3 million of other restructuring costs. We expect to record approximately $12 million of the total restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We anticipate this action will be completed by the end of fiscal 2018.

In addition, we notified the union member employees and union representatives at our New Albany facility of our tentative decision, pending negotiations and consultation with the union, to close this manufacturing facility. If implemented, this action could affect approximately 400 positions and we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $88 million of which approximately $44 million will be cash. These restructuring charges include approximately $36 million of severance expense, $36 million of asset write-offs, and $16 million of other restructuring costs. We expect to record approximately $55 million of the total restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. We anticipate this action will be completed by the end of fiscal 2018.
