Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Our fourth quarter results showed significant improvement as many of our Greatness Agenda initiatives took hold. Our 3.7% increase in comparable sales was driven by both transactions per store - a key area of focus - and average transaction value. The sales strength was broad as all lines of business and all geographic regions reported higher sales. Our teams managed both expenses and inventories well, allowing us to exceed our previous earnings guidance."
