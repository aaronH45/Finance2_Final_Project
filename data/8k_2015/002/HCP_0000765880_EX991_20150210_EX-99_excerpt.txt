IRVINE, CA, February 10, 2015 – HCP (the “Company” or “we”) (NYSE:HCP) announced results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014 as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

FOURTH QUARTER COMPARISON 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

________________________________________ 

(1) This impairment relates to a December 2014 charge for our 9.4% equity ownership interest in HCR ManorCare, Inc. (“HCRMC”). 

(2) Transaction-related items were attributable to acquisition and pursuit costs. 

In addition to the items above, operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 included the positive impact of $0.01 per share of equity income from an unconsolidated joint venture related to a capital distribution from our interest in a senior housing development project. Net income for the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 also included net gain on sales of real estate of $3 million and $59 million, respectively. 

FULL YEAR COMPARISON 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

________________________________________ 

(1) Transaction-related items in 2014 were attributable to the positive impact resulting from the previously announced transaction with Brookdale Senior Living, which closed in August 2014 (the “Brookdale Transaction”), partially offset by acquisition and pursuit costs. Amounts in 2013 were attributable to acquisition and pursuit costs. 

(2) Severance-related charges were attributable to the 2013 termination of our former chief executive officer. 

In addition to the items above, 2013 operating results included the positive impact of: (i) $0.05 per share of interest income from the par payoff of our Barchester debt investments; (ii) $0.02 per share related to gain on sales of marketable securities; and (iii) $0.01 per share of equity income from a senior housing development project; partially offset by a $0.02 per share charge resulting from an adjustment to non-cash rents, primarily in our hospital segment. Net income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 also included net gain on sales of real estate of $31 million and $68 million, respectively.

FFO, FFO as adjusted and FAD are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts. See the “Funds From Operations” and “Funds Available for Distribution” sections of this release for additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures. 

FOURTH QUARTER AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS 

HC-ONE DEBT INVESTMENT IN U.K. 

In November 2014, we were the lead investor in the financing for Formation Capital and Safanad’s acquisition of NHP, a company that, at closing, owned 273 nursing and residential care homes representing over 12,500 beds in the U.K. principally operated by HC-One. We provided a loan facility (the “Facility”) totaling $630 million (£395 million), secured by substantially all of NHP’s assets, with £363 million drawn at closing. The HC-One Facility has a five-year term and is projected to achieve a blended 8.2% yield-to-maturity. 

In February 2015, we increased our HC-One Facility by $165 million (£108 million) to $795 million (£502 million), in conjunction with HC-One’s acquisition of Meridian Healthcare. Under the terms of the amended HC-One Facility, by the end of the first quarter 2015, we expect to convert £174 million of our HC-One Facility into a sale-leaseback transaction of equal value for 36 properties with an initial lease yield of 7.3%. 

OTHER INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS 

During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, we acquired three U.K. care homes leased to Maria Mallaband Care Group for $20 million (£12 million) and three medical office buildings for $51 million. In addition, we funded $112 million for construction and other capital projects, primarily in our life science, medical office and senior housing segments. 

In February 2015, we began construction on the first phase of The Cove at Oyster Point, a life science development in South San Francisco. The first phase includes two buildings totaling 253,000 sq. ft. that are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. 

FINANCING ACTIVITIES 

In January 2015, we issued $600 million of 3.4% senior unsecured notes due 2025. The notes were priced at 99.185% of the principal amount with a yield-to-maturity of 3.497%; net proceeds were used to repay the entire $105 million U.S. dollar amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility at closing. We intend to use the remaining proceeds to repay $400 million of unsecured notes maturing in March and June 2015 and for general corporate purposes. 

Also in January 2015, we completed a $333 million (£220 million) four-year unsecured term loan that accrues interest at GBP LIBOR plus 0.975%, subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings. Concurrently, we entered into a three-year interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the rate of the term loan at 1.79%. Proceeds from this term loan were used to repay £220 million of the GBP balance drawn on our revolving credit facility to fund the aforementioned November 2014 HC-One debt investment. 

LIFE SCIENCE AND MEDICAL OFFICE LEASING HIGHLIGHTS 

During the fourth quarter, we completed 1.3 million sq. ft. of leasing in our life science and medical office segments, consisting of 900,000 sq. ft. of renewals and 400,000 sq. ft. of new leases. Significant new leasing transactions include: 

· 15-year lease with the University of California, Davis for the entire 92,000 sq. ft. medical office redevelopment project in Sacramento, California 

· 7-year lease with a biotechnology company for a 30,000 sq. ft. building in South San Francisco, California. HCP will invest $13 million to reposition the life science building to a first class lab facility 

· 10-year, 72,000 sq. ft. lease for 86% of a recently redeveloped medical office building in San Diego, California 

At December 31, 2014, life science occupancy achieved another all-time high for the segment at 95.2%, representing an increase of 280 bps over 2013; medical office occupancy was 90.8%. 

In January 2015, we executed a 7-year lease with a biotechnology company for an entire 42,000 sq. ft. building in our Redwood City, California campus.

SUSTAINABILITY 

During the fourth quarter, Building Owners and Managers Association (“BOMA”) International presented four of our medical office buildings with The Outstanding Building of the Year (“TOBY”) award in their respective locations. Additionally, we contributed to educational and charitable organizations in partnership with our employees, tenants and peers, including: (i) contributions to the University of California, Irvine Institute for Memory Impairment and Neurological Disorders (“UCI MIND”) to advance Alzheimer’s research, and (ii) participation in the Walk to End Alzheimer’s, one of the nation’s largest events to raise awareness and funds for Alzheimer’s care, support and research. 

In 2014, HCP was named the Global Leader for the Healthcare Sector by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB); this is the third consecutive year that HCP ranked 1st among all survey respondents within its sector. HCP was ranked 2nd for environmental performance in the real estate industry by the 2014 Newsweek Green Rankings. Additionally, HCP was named to the CDP S&P 500 Climate Disclosure Leadership Index and was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the second consecutive year and the FTSE4Good Index for the third consecutive year. Through December 31, 2014, we have a total of 149 ENERGY STAR and 10 LEED certifications. More information about HCP’s sustainability efforts can be found on our website at www.hcpi.com/sustainability. 

DIVIDEND 

On January 29, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.565 per common share. The dividend will be paid on February 24, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2015. The annualized distribution rate per share for 2015 increased 3.7% to $2.26, compared to $2.18 for 2014, which represents the 30th consecutive year with a dividend increase. HCP continues as the only REIT included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index. 

2015 OUTLOOK 

We expect 2015 FFO per share to range between $3.14 and $3.20, representing a growth rate of 6%; FFO as adjusted per share to range between $3.15 and $3.21, representing a growth rate of 5%; FAD per share to range between $2.73 and $2.79, representing a growth rate of 7%; and EPS to range between $1.98 and $2.04. These estimates do not reflect the potential impact of future acquisitions or dispositions, and year-over-year growth rates are based on the mid-point of 2015 estimates over their comparable 2014 amounts. Refer to the “Projected Future Operations” section of this release for additional information regarding these estimates.

Funds From Operations(1) 

In thousands, except per share data 

(Unaudited) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

________________________________________ 

(1) We believe Funds From Operations (“FFO”) is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was developed by the REIT industry to address this issue. FFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) is net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or “GAAP”), excluding gains or losses from sales of property, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and direct financing lease (“DFL”) depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from ours. FFO as adjusted represents FFO before the impact of impairments (recoveries) of non-depreciable assets, transaction-related items (defined below) and severance-related charges. Management believes that FFO as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our FFO run-rate. This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income or NAREIT FFO. 

(2) For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014, other depreciation and amortization includes: (i) $4 million and $16 million, respectively, of DFL depreciation and (ii) $2 million and $3 million, respectively, of lease incentive amortization (reduction of straight-line rents) for the consideration given to terminate the 30 purchase options of the 153-property amended lease portfolio in the Brookdale Transaction. 

(3) The other impairment charge of $35.9 million, or $0.08 per share, relates to our 9.4% equity ownership interest in HCRMC. 

(4) Transaction-related items include acquisition and pursuit costs (e.g., due diligence and closing) and gains/charges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities. The year ended December 31, 2014, includes the $0.04 per share net benefit from the Brookdale Transaction of $0.08 per share, partially offset by acquisition and pursuit costs of $0.04 per share.

Funds Available for Distribution(1) 

In thousands, except per share data 

(Unaudited) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

________________________________________ 

(1) Funds Available for Distribution (“FAD”) is defined as FFO as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) amortization of acquired market lease intangibles, net; (ii) amortization of deferred compensation expense; (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs, net; (iv) straight-line rents; (v) accretion and depreciation related to DFLs; and (vi) deferred revenues, effective 2014, excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements owned/recognized by us and up-front cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents. Also, FAD is: (i) computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements; and (ii) includes lease restructure payments (see note 5) and adjustments to compute our share of FAD from our unconsolidated joint ventures and those related to CCRC non-refundable entrance fees (see note 6). Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating FAD, and accordingly, our FAD may not be comparable to similar metrics (e.g., FAD or AFFO) reported by other REITs. Although our FAD computation may not be comparable to that of other REITs, management believes FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our ability to fund our ongoing dividend payments. In addition, management believes that in order to further understand and analyze our liquidity, FAD should not be compared with net cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP and presented in our consolidated financial statements. FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of our liquidity. 

(2) Excludes $16.7 million related to the acceleration of deferred compensation for restricted stock units and options that vested upon termination of our former chief executive officer on October 2, 2013, which is included in severance-related charges for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2013. 

(3) For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014, DFL accretion reflects an elimination of $15.6 million and $62.4 million, respectively. For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2013, DFL accretion reflects an elimination of $15.5 million and $62.1 million, respectively. Our ownership interest in HCRMC is accounted for using the equity method, which requires an ongoing elimination of DFL income that is proportional to our ownership in HCRMC. Further, our share of earnings from HCRMC (equity income) increases for the corresponding elimination of related lease expense recognized at the HCRMC entity level, which we present as a non-cash joint venture FAD adjustment. 

(4) Leasing costs and tenant and capital improvements, net of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests. 

(5) Over a period of three years from the closing of the Brookdale Transaction, we will receive installment payments valued at $55 million for terminating the leases on the HCP owned 49-property portfolio; we include these installment payments in FAD as the payments are collected. 

(6) Represents our 49% share of non-refundable entrance fees included in FAD as the fees are collected by our CCRC JV.

Net Operating Income and Same Property Performance(1)(2) 

Dollars in thousands 

(Unaudited) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) We believe Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations (“NOI”) provides investors relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and cash NOI to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate our same property portfolio (“SPP”). We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) since it excludes certain components from net income. Further, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs or real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI. 

NOI is defined as rental and related revenues, including tenant recoveries, resident fees and services, and income from DFLs, less property level operating expenses; NOI excludes all of the other financial statement amounts itemized above. Cash NOI is calculated as NOI after eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, DFL accretion, amortization of market lease intangibles and lease termination fees. Cash NOI is oftentimes referred to as “adjusted NOI.” 

(2) SPP statistics allow management to evaluate the performance of our real estate portfolio under a consistent population, which eliminates the changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties. We identify our SPP as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or operating properties (RIDEA) for the duration of the year-over-year comparison periods presented. Accordingly, it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our SPP. SPP NOI excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.

Projected Future Operations(1) 

(Unaudited) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

________________________________________ 

(1) Except as otherwise noted above, the foregoing projections reflect management’s view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels, development items and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release. Except as otherwise noted, these estimates do not reflect the potential impact of future acquisitions, dispositions, other impairments or recoveries, the future bankruptcy or insolvency of our operators, lessees, borrowers or other obligors, the effect of any future restructuring of our contractual relationships with such entities, gains or losses on marketable securities, ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, or existing and future litigation matters including the possibility of larger than expected litigation costs and related developments. There can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth above. The aforementioned ranges represent management’s best estimates based upon the underlying assumptions as of the date of this press release. Except as otherwise required by law, management assumes no, and hereby disclaims any, obligation to update any of the foregoing projections as a result of new information or new or future developments. 

(2) Reflects the gain on sale related to eight senior housing communities that were sold in January 2015 to Brookdale. 

(3) Our ownership interest in HCRMC is accounted for using the equity method, which requires an ongoing elimination of DFL income that is proportional to our ownership in HCRMC. Further, our share of earnings from HCRMC (equity income) increases for the corresponding elimination of related lease expense recognized at the HCRMC entity level, which we present as a non-cash joint venture FAD adjustment. 

(4) Over a period of three years from the closing of the Brookdale Transaction in 2014, we will receive installment payments valued at $55 million for terminating the leases on the HCP owned 49-property portfolio; we include these installment payments in FAD as the payments are collected. 

(5) Represents our 49% share of non-refundable entrance fees included in FAD as they are collected by our CCRC JV.
