In March 2014, Ofgem issued its final decision on the DPCR4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism. As a result, WPD increased its existing liability by $65 million, pre-tax, for over-recovery of line losses. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements of the 2014 10-K for additional information."
