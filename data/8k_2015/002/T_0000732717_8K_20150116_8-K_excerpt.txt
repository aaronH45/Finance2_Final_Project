Item 8.01 Other Events. 

On January 16, 2015, AT&T Inc. ("AT&T", "we" or "the Company") provided updated information regarding certain fourth-quarter items. 

For the quarter ended December 31, 2014, we expect to record a noncash, pre-tax loss of approximately $7.9 billion related to actuarial gains and losses on pension and postemployment benefit plans. At December 31, 2014, we decreased our assumed discount rates used to measure our pension obligation to 4.3% and to 4.2% for our postretirement obligation. These reductions resulted in an actuarial loss of approximately $7.9 billion. Also contributing to the amount were losses due to updated mortality assumptions offset by asset gains in excess of our assumed rate of return as well as demographic changes and other assumptions. Actuarial gains and losses are managed on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results. Therefore, this loss will not affect segment operating results or margins. 

Our fourth-quarter 2014 operating results will also include a $2.1 billion noncash charge for the abandonment in place of certain network assets. During the fourth quarter, we performed an analysis of our network assets and determined that specific copper assets will not be necessary to support future network activity, due to declining customer demand for our legacy voice and data products and the migration of our networks to next generation technology. This decision by management will not be considered in our assessment of segment performance and therefore, this charge will be reflected only in consolidated results and will not affect segment operating results or margins.
