   Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.    

  As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 6, 2014, each of the executive officers of the Company is eligible to receive a bonus award under the Company’s Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") in an amount ranging from 0% to 200% of the executive’s target bonus opportunity for the six-month period ended January 2, 2015 based upon the Company’s performance during such period as measured against pre-established goals, and subject to upward or downward adjustment in the discretion of the Compensation Committee depending upon the executive’s individual and business group’s performance. 

Effective January 20, 2015, for each executive officer the Compensation Committee determined the achievement and payout rate for the applicable performance goals under the ICP for the six-month period ended January 2, 2015. The Compensation Committee approved an incremental upward adjustment to the payout rate for Mr. Murphy resulting in an ICP bonus for the period of $343,750.
