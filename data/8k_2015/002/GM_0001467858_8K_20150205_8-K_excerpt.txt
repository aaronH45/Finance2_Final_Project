ITEM 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

Linda R. Gooden was elected to the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of General Motors Company (“GM”) as of February 5, 2015. Ms. Gooden has not been named to any committees of the Board. The Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Gooden is an independent director under New York Stock Exchange listing standards and GM’s independence guidelines, as set forth in its Corporate Governance Guidelines (available on GM’s Web site at www.gm.com/investor, under “Corporate Governance”).

Like the other non-employee members of the Board, Ms. Gooden will receive an annual retainer of $250,000 for her service on the Board (prorated to reflect the date her service on the Board begins in 2015), as well as the use of up to two company vehicles and personal accident insurance. 

Under the General Motors Company Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, Ms. Gooden is required to defer 50% of her annual Board retainer into share units of GM Common Stock and may elect to defer all or 50% of her remaining Board compensation in additional deferred share units of GM Common Stock. Amounts deferred and credited as share units under this plan will not be available until after Ms. Gooden retires or otherwise leaves the Board, at which time she will receive a cash payment or payments based on the number of deferred share units in her account, valued at the average daily market price for the quarter immediately preceding payment. 

All non-employee directors are reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses incurred in connection with their duties as directors.
