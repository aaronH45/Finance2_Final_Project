        "The table above sets forth non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. These non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per common share measures exclude amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, certain employee termination, asset impairment and other charges, certain charges related to an arbitration award and other charges that are unusual, non-recurring or may not be indicative of ongoing operations. The Company believes that non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are useful measures to investors as an alternative method for measuring the Companyâ€™s earnings performance and comparing it against prior periods. The presentation of these adjusted amounts vary from numbers presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies. The tax effect of the aforementioned items was not material to the condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and six month periods ended January 2, 2015 and December 27, 2013."
