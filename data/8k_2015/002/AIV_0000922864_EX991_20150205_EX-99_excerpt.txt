Aimco Reports Fourth Quarter 2014 Results, Provides 2015 Guidance

Denver, Colorado, February 5, 2015 - Apartment Investment and Management Company (“Aimco”) (NYSE: AIV) announced today its fourth quarter and full year 2014 results.

Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: "Aimco enjoyed a solid 2014. Profitability was up, with AFFO increasing 10% year-over-year. Portfolio quality was up, with average monthly revenue per apartment home increasing 14% to $1,670. Redevelopment and development projects underway are expected to create incremental net asset value equal to 35% of our investment.

The Aimco balance sheet is strong: considering the equity offering earlier this year, leverage, net of cash, is both non-recourse and about 36% of Aimco's market capitalization; more than $550 million in credit is available on the Aimco line of credit; and the unencumbered pool includes properties valued at more than $1 billion. These results reflect the hard work of a motivated team, whose collaborative culture was recognized again in 2014 as a 'Top Place to Work'.

Looking forward, we expect 2015 to be another good year with steady rent growth, disciplined cost control, and solid Same Store NOI growth. Together with increased contribution from redevelopment and acquisition properties, and reduced interest expense, we expect AFFO to be up by 10% at the midpoint of guidance.

Aimco prospects reflect disciplined portfolio management. Over the past three years, we have sold 27,000 apartment homes, eliminating related property management costs and Capital Replacement spending. We have reinvested the sales proceeds to redevelop or acquire apartment homes with higher rents, higher margins and greater expected growth.

The Aimco Board of Directors considered these results and prospects in its decision to increase the dividend by 8%."

Financial Results: Full Year AFFO Up 10%

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Pro forma FFO - Year-over-year, fourth quarter Pro forma FFO decreased 5%. For the quarter, strong property operating results, increased contribution from redevelopment communities, higher income tax benefit and lower interest expense were more than offset by: the loss of income from apartment communities that were sold; lower interest income as a result of repayment of notes receivable in fourth quarter 2013; lower non-recurring income; higher preferred stock dividends attributable to Aimco's second quarter 2014 offering of its Class A Preferred Stock; and costs incurred in connection with fourth quarter 2014 acquisition activity.

Adjusted Funds from Operations - Fourth quarter AFFO was flat when compared to fourth quarter 2013, as a result of lower Pro forma FFO offset by lower Capital Replacement spending associated with multi-phase capital projects started in prior years, and lower Capital Replacement spending due to the sale of approximately 9,000 apartment homes during 2014. As Aimco concentrates its investment capital in higher quality, higher price point apartment communities, free cash flow margin is increasing as Capital Replacements decline as a percentage of net operating income.

Operating Results: Fourth Quarter Conventional Same Store NOI Up 6.1%, Full Year Up 5.5% 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Rental Rates - Aimco measures changes in rental rates by comparing, on a lease-by-lease basis, the rate on a newly executed lease to the rate on the expiring lease for that same apartment. Newly executed leases are classified either as a new lease, where a vacant apartment is leased to a new customer, or as a renewal.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Portfolio Management: Revenue Per Apartment Home Up 13.6% to $1,669

Aimco portfolio strategy seeks predictable rent growth from a portfolio of "A", "B" and "C+" quality market-rate apartment communities, averaging "B/B+" in quality, and diversified among the largest coastal and job growth markets in the U.S., as measured by total apartment value. Aimco target markets are primarily coastal markets, and also include several Sun Belt cities and Chicago, Illinois.

Aimco measures asset quality based on rents compared to local market average rents as reported by REIS, a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance information and analysis. Aimco defines asset quality as follows: "A" quality assets are those with rents greater than 125% of local market average; "B" quality assets are those with rents between 90% to 125% of local market average; "C+" quality assets are those with rents lower than 90% of local market average, but greater than $1,100 per month; and "C" quality assets are those with rents lower than 90% of local market average, but less than $1,100 per month.

Aimco's portfolio strategy is to sell each year the lowest-rated 5% to 10% of its portfolio and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in redevelopment and acquisition of higher-quality apartment communities. Through this disciplined approach to capital recycling, Aimco has significantly increased the quality of its portfolio. Over the last three years, Aimco:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Increased its Conventional portfolio free cash flow margin by 10% through the sale of lower-rent properties and reinvestment in higher-rent properties;

•Reduced by 83% the percentage of its portfolio represented by "C" quality properties and increased by 42% the percentage of its portfolio represented by "A" quality properties; and

•Increased to 90% the percentage of its Conventional Property Net Operating Income earned in Aimco's target markets.

2

As Aimco executes its portfolio strategy, it expects to continue to increase Conventional portfolio average revenue per apartment home at a rate greater than market rent growth; to increase further free cash flow margins; to sell the percentage of its portfolio represented by "C" quality properties; and to increase to 95% or more the percentage of its Conventional Property Net Operating Income earned in its target markets.

Fourth Quarter 2014 Dispositions - In the fourth quarter, Aimco sold two Conventional Apartment Communities and two Affordable Apartment Communities with 500 and 199 apartment homes, respectively, for $79.5 million in gross proceeds. Aimco's share of net sales proceeds after distributions to limited partners, repayment of existing property debt and transaction costs was $45.8 million.

Fourth Quarter 2014 Acquisitions - In the fourth quarter, Aimco acquired:

•Saybrook Pointe Apartment Homes for $118.4 million. This is a 324 apartment home community located in San Jose, California. Revenues per apartment home average $2,240, making this a "B" quality asset for Aimco. Aimco expects to add value through property upgrades and operational improvements.

•Tremont Apartment Homes for $25 million. This is a 78 apartment home community with 14,000 square feet of retail space in the Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. Revenues per apartment home average $2,280, making this an "A" quality asset for Aimco. Aimco expects to add value through operational improvements.

•Eastpointe Apartment Homes for $18 million. This is a 140 apartment home community located in Boulder, Colorado. This low density community, built on more than seven acres in the mid-1970s, is located in a city with strong demand for housing and public policies that discourage new supply. It is across the street from a new community hospital complex and other major employment centers. Revenues per apartment home average $1,035, making this a "B" quality asset as presently operated. Aimco plans to redevelop this community.

Also in fourth quarter, Aimco acquired 2.4 acres in the heart of downtown La Jolla, California, adjoining and overlooking La Jolla Cove and the Pacific Ocean. The property is zoned for multi-family and mixed-use purposes and is currently occupied by three small commercial buildings and a limited-service hotel, which is managed for Aimco by a third party. Aimco plans to redevelop this property and considers its current use an income-producing “land bank.” Under Aimco's agreements with the sellers of this property, terms of the transactions are confidential.

Quarter-End Portfolio - Fourth quarter 2014 Conventional portfolio average monthly revenue per apartment home was $1,669, a 13.6% increase compared to fourth quarter 2013, as a result of year-over-year Same Store monthly revenue per apartment home growth of 4.4% and the sale of Conventional Apartment Communities during 2014 with average monthly revenues per apartment home substantially lower than those of the retained portfolio and reinvestment of the sales proceeds in higher-rent apartment communities through redevelopment and acquisitions. For third quarter 2014, the most recent period for which REIS information is available, Aimco Conventional Apartment Community rents averaged 108% of local market average rents.

Redevelopment: Creating Value and Maintaining Investment Pace

During fourth quarter, Aimco invested $35.5 million in redevelopment. Construction is nearing completion at Aimco's two largest redevelopment projects: Lincoln Place, in Venice, California, and Preserve at Marin, in Corte Madera, California. As of December 31, 2014, 589 of the 767 completed apartment homes at Lincoln Place and 59 of the 72 completed apartment homes at Preserve at Marin were occupied. Aimco expects to complete construction at Lincoln Place and Preserve at Marin in first quarter 2015, on time and at a cost consistent with previous reports. 

During fourth quarter, Aimco completed, as planned, the redevelopment of The Palazzo at Park La Brea. Aimco also de-leased Ocean House on Prospect, located in La Jolla, California as well as one of four towers at Park Town Place, located in Center City Philadelphia. Construction at both communities is progressing as planned.

Also during fourth quarter 2014, Aimco approved a plan to continue redevelopment of The Sterling, located in Center City Philadelphia. During the third quarter, Aimco completed the redevelopment of 69 apartment homes on three floors of the 29-story building on time, on budget and achieved rents above budget. Renovation of the common areas and commercial space is proceeding as planned and Aimco continues to expect construction to be completed in second quarter 2015 at a cost consistent with underwriting. These results led to Aimco’s decision to redevelop an additional four floors with 105 apartment homes for an additional investment of approximately $11 million.

Development: Progressing as Planned

During fourth quarter, Aimco invested $15.1 million in the development of One Canal Street, located in Boston. One Canal Street will include 310 apartment homes and 22,000 square feet of commercial space. Aimco expects completion of construction in second quarter 2016 with lease-up beginning in first quarter 2016.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity: Leverage on Target and Declining

Components of Aimco Leverage

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

De-Levering Activities Subsequent to Year-End

In January 2015, Aimco sold in a public offering 9,430,000 shares of Common Stock at $38.90 per share, providing net proceeds of $366.8 million. Using the proceeds from this offering, Aimco repaid in January the outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility. Also, Aimco has provided the 30-day notification required to redeem the outstanding balance of its Series A Community Reinvestment Act Preferred Stock at its liquidation preference of $27 million. Aimco expects to use the remainder of the proceeds from this offering to repay $102 million of property debt, and to fund redevelopment and property upgrades during 2015 that would otherwise have been funded with property debt on a leverage-neutral basis.

4

Leverage Ratios

Aimco leverage targets are: Debt and Preferred Equity to EBITDA below 7.0x; and EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends greater than 2.5x. Aimco also focuses on Debt to EBITDA and EBITDA Coverage of Interest ratios. See the Glossary for definitions of these metrics.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*The Debt to EBITDA and Debt and Preferred Equity to EBITDA ratios presented for the year ended December 31, 2014

 have been adjusted on a pro-forma basis to reflect the proceeds from the January stock offering described above.

Future leverage reduction is expected from both earnings growth, especially as apartment communities now being redeveloped or developed are completed, and from regularly scheduled property debt amortization funded from retained earnings.

Liquidity

Aimco recourse debt at December 31, 2014, was limited to its revolving credit facility, which Aimco uses for working capital and other short-term purposes, and to secure letters of credit.

At year-end, Aimco had outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility of $112.3 million and available capacity of $445.9 million, net of $41.8 million of letters of credit backed by the facility. Aimco also held cash and restricted cash on hand of $118.3 million. Finally, Aimco held 15 apartment communities in its unencumbered asset pool with a total estimated fair market value exceeding $1 billion. After the public offering and de-levering activities described above, outstanding borrowings on Aimco's revolving credit facility are fully repaid, the available capacity is $558.2 million and Aimco held cash and restricted cash on hand of approximately $340 million.

Equity Activity

Dividend - As previously announced, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 8% compared to dividends paid during 2014. This dividend is payable on February 27, 2015, to stockholders of record on February 13, 2015.

Summary of Redevelopment and Development Activity       (Page 2 of 4)

Terms and Definitions   

Estimated Net Investment - represents total estimated investment, net of tax and other credits earned by Aimco as a direct result of its redevelopment or development of the community. Total estimated investment includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to redevelop or develop the respective community, as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Aimco expects to update its projections at least annually to reflect changes in market rents and rental rate achievement.

Commercial Revenue - represents the projected annual revenue, or incremental revenue, contribution from commercial rents attributable to the redevelopment of commercial space.

Current Residential Occupancy - for previously vacant communities and new development, represents physical occupancy as of December 31, 2014. For operating communities, represents fourth quarter 2014 average daily occupancy.

Monthly Revenue per Apartment Home - represents the sum of projected rents and other rental income on a per-apartment home basis. Projections are based on management's judgment and take into consideration factors including but not limited to: current rent and other rental income expectations; current market rents; and rental achievement to date. Aimco expects to update these projections at least annually to reflect changes in market rents and rental rate achievement.

Weighted Average Projected NOI as a % of Estimated Net Investment (Unescalated Rents) - projected NOI takes into consideration the revenue information provided herein, as well as expectations around 1) operating costs associated with previously vacant communities and new development, and 2) net incremental changes in operating costs, if any, resulting from the redevelopment of operating communities.

GLOSSARY AND RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES

This Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial and operating measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Aimco's definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP financial and operating measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial and operating measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance and should not be considered an alternative measure of liquidity. 

ACQUISITION APARTMENT COMMUNITIES: Apartment Communities acquired since January 1, 2013.

AFFORDABLE APARTMENT COMMUNITIES: Affordable Apartment Communities benefit from governmental programs intended to provide housing to people with low or moderate incomes. These programs, which are usually administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or state housing finance agencies, typically provide mortgage insurance, favorable financing terms, tax credits, or rental assistance payments to the owners of the communities. Under these programs, rent adjustments are made in accordance with property-specific contracts between Aimco and HUD, with rent increases generally based on an adjustment factor set by HUD annually. 

AIMCO OP: AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, is the operating partnership in Aimco's UPREIT structure. Aimco owns approximately 95% of the common partnership units of the Aimco OP.

AIMCO PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Non-GAAP measures representing Aimco's share of financial information discussed in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information. Aimco's proportionate share of financial information includes Aimco's share of unconsolidated real estate partnerships and excludes noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Proportionate reporting benefits the users of Aimco's financial information by providing the amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities attributable only to Aimco stockholders. Aimco also refers to this measure as "Aimco's Share" of financial information. See Supplemental Schedules 2, 4 and 5 for reconciliation of Aimco's proportionate share of financial results to Aimco's consolidated financial statements.

AVERAGE AGE OF APARTMENT COMMUNITIES: Average Age of Apartment Communities is calculated by Aimco based on the year the community was originally built, adjusted for redevelopment and/or other major capital improvements that effectively reduce the age of the community. Such investments include construction of new buildings and/or amenities, replacement or modernization of mechanical, plumbing and electrical systems, and other investments that are consequential in nature.

CAPITAL ADDITIONS DEFINITIONS

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI): CI includes all non-Redevelopment capital additions that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. 

CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR): Unlike CI, CR does not increase the useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. CR represents the portion of capital additions that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. CR is deducted in the calculation of AFFO. 

CASUALTY CAPITAL ADDITIONS: Casualty capital additions represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with the restoration of an asset after a casualty event such as a hurricane, tornado or flood.

PROPERTY UPGRADES: Property Upgrades may include kitchen and bath remodeling; energy conservation projects; and investments in longer-lived materials designed to reduce turnover costs, such as simulated wood flooring and granite countertops. Property Upgrades differ from Redevelopment Additions in that they are generally lesser in scope and do not significantly disrupt property operations.

32

REDEVELOPMENT ADDITIONS: Redevelopment additions represent capital additions intended to enhance the value of the apartment community through the ability to generate higher average rental rates. Redevelopment additions may include costs related to entitlement, which enhance the value of a community through increased density, and costs related to renovation of exteriors, common areas or apartment homes. 

CONVENTIONAL APARTMENT COMMUNITIES: Conventional Apartment Communities represent Aimco's portfolio of market-rate apartment communities. Aimco's portfolio strategy seeks predictable rent growth from a portfolio of "A", "B" and "C+" quality Conventional Apartment Communities, averaging "B/B+" in quality, and diversified among the largest coastal and job growth markets in the United States, as measured by apartment value. 

DEBT RATIO DEFINITIONS

ADJUSTED INTEREST EXPENSE: Adjusted Interest Expense represents Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense less (i) prepayment penalties and amortization of deferred financing costs and (ii) the amount of interest income recognized by Aimco related to its investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding primarily Aimco property debt.

DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO:  The ratio of (a) Aimco's proportionate share of debt net of Aimco's proportionate share of cash and restricted cash, and Aimco's investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding primarily Aimco property debt to (b) Proportionate EBITDA.

DEBT AND PREFERRED EQUITY TO EBITDA RATIO: The ratio of (a) Aimco's proportionate share of debt net of Aimco's proportionate share of cash and restricted cash, and Aimco's investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding primarily Aimco property debt, plus Aimco's preferred stock and the preferred units of the Aimco OP to (b) Proportionate EBITDA.

DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO: As defined in Aimco's credit agreement, the ratio of (a) Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, reduced by certain capital expenditure reserves (which Aimco refers to as "Compliance EBITDA"), to (b) debt service, which represents the sum of (i) Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense (excluding prepayment penalties and amortization of deferred financing costs) and (ii) debt amortization, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation.

EBITDA COVERAGE OF INTEREST RATIO: The ratio of (a) Proportionate EBITDA to (b) Adjusted Interest Expense. 

EBITDA COVERAGE OF INTEREST AND PREFERRED DIVIDENDS RATIO: The ratio of (a) Proportionate EBITDA to (b) the sum of Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends. 

FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO: As defined by Aimco's credit agreement, the ratio of (a) Compliance EBITDA to (b) fixed charges, which represent the sum of (i) Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense (excluding prepayment penalties and amortization of deferred financing costs), (ii) debt amortization and (iii) Preferred Dividends, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation.

PREFERRED DIVIDENDS: Preferred dividends include dividends paid with respect to Aimco's Preferred Stock and the Aimco OP Preferred Partnership Units.

PROPORTIONATE EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (PROPORTIONATE EBITDA): Proportionate EBITDA is computed by adding to Aimco's Pro forma FFO (a) Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization related to non-real estate assets, non-cash stock compensation expense and (b) Preferred Dividends.

DEFFERED TAX CREDIT INCOME: Deferred income includes $44.8 million of unamortized cash contributions received by Aimco in exchange for the allocation of tax credits and related tax benefits to investors in tax credit arrangements. These cash contributions are deferred upon receipt and amortized into earnings in future periods as Aimco delivers the tax credits and related benefits to the investors. Under existing tax credit agreements, Aimco will 

33

receive additional cash contributions of $25.6 million, of which $5.3 million will be received during 2015, and, on average, $5.1 million will be received each year from 2016 through 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

EFFECTIVE APARTMENT HOMES: The number of actual apartment homes multiplied by Aimco's ownership interest in the apartment community as of the end of the current period. Effective Apartment Homes may be used to analyze Aimco's proportionate financial measures on a per-home basis. 

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO):  FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of, and impairment losses recognized with respect to, depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Aimco computes FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT. 

In addition to FFO, Aimco uses PRO FORMA FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (Pro forma FFO) and ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO) to measure performance. Pro forma FFO represents FFO as defined above, excluding preferred equity redemption related amounts (adjusted for noncontrolling interests). Preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) are items that periodically affect Aimco's operating results. Aimco excludes preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) from Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of operating performance. AFFO represents Pro forma FFO reduced by Capital Replacements (also adjusted for noncontrolling interests). 

FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO are helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because they capture features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO, Pro forma FFO or AFFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. 

MONEY-WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE: Money-Weighted Average Interest Rate represents the weighted average interest rate on Aimco’s fixed and floating rate property debt, which takes into account the timing of amortization and maturities. This rate is calculated by Aimco based on the unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2014, and all contractual debt service payments associated with each of its fixed and floating rate property loans. The Money-Weighted Average Interest Rate can be compared to market interest rates to estimate the difference between the book value of Aimco’s fixed and floating rate property debt and the market value of such debt.

NEW LEASE AND RENEWAL RATES: Aimco measures changes in rental rates by comparing, on a lease-by-lease basis, the rate on a newly executed lease to the rate on the expiring lease for that same apartment. Newly executed leases are classified as either a new lease, where a vacant apartment is leased to a new customer, or a renewal of an existing lease.

34

OTHER AFFORDABLE APARTMENT COMMUNITIES: Affordable Apartment Communities that do not meet the Same Store Apartment Community definition.
