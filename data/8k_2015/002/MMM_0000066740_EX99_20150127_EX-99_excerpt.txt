(a) The changes in 3M’s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans’ funded status, which is required to be measured as of each year-end, significantly impacted several balance sheet amounts. In the fourth quarter of 2014, these required annual measurements decreased prepaid pension benefits by $0.7 billion, increased deferred taxes within other assets by $0.8 billion, increased pension and postretirement benefits’ long-term liabilities by $1.9 billion, and decreased stockholders’ equity by $1.8 billion. Other pension and postretirement changes during the year, such as contributions and amortization, also impacted these balance sheet amounts.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(c) Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are useful measures of performance and uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(d) The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M considers net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(e) The Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. 3M’s net working capital index is defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable. This measure is not recognized under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(f) The Company uses non-GAAP measures to focus on shareholder value creation. 3M uses Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), defined as annualized after-tax operating income (including interest income) divided by average operating capital. Operating capital is defined as net assets (total assets less total liabilities) excluding debt. This measure is not recognized under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

(Dollars in millions) 

(Unaudited) 

Effective in the first quarter of 2014, 3M transferred a product line between divisions within different business segments and made other changes within business segments in its continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers. 

The product move between business segments was as follows: 

· The movement of the Fire Protection product line from the Building and Commercial Services Division (Safety and Graphics business segment) to the Industrial Adhesives and Tapes Division (Industrial business segment). This product move resulted in an increase in net sales for total year 2013 of $73 million in the Industrial business segment offset by a corresponding decrease in the Safety and Graphics business segment. 

In addition, other changes within business segments were as follows: 

· The combination of certain existing divisions/departments into new divisions. Within the Electronics and Energy business segment, the new divisions include the Electrical Markets Division (which includes the former Infrastructure Protection Division), and the Electronic Solutions Division (which includes the former 3M Touch Systems, Inc.). Within the Safety and Graphics business segment, the new Commercial Solutions Division was created from the combination of the former Architectural Markets Department, the former Building and Commercial Services Division and the former Commercial Graphics Division. None of these combinations crossed business segments. 

· The renaming of the former Aerospace and Aircraft Maintenance Division within the Industrial business segment to the Aerospace and Commercial Transportation Division. 

· The movement of certain product lines between various divisions within the same business segment. 

Effective in the second quarter of 2014, within the Electronics and Energy business segment, 3M combined three existing divisions into two new divisions. A large portion of both the Electronics Markets Materials Division and the Electronic Solutions Division were combined to form the Electronics Materials Solutions Division, which focuses on semiconductor and electronics materials and assembly solutions. The Optical Systems Division, the remaining portion of the Electronic Solutions Division and a portion of the Electronics Markets Materials Division were combined to form the Display Materials and Systems Division, which focuses on delivering light, color and user interface solutions. 

Effective in the fourth quarter of 2014, within the Industrial business segment, the Personal Care Division, which focuses on tapes and attachment systems for infant and adult hygiene, was combined with the Industrial Adhesives and Tapes Division. 

The financial information presented herein reflects, for all periods presented, the impact of these realignments. Refer to 3M’s Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on March 5, 2014, and 3M’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 15, 2014, for additional information concerning the business segment realignments effective in the first quarter of 2014.
