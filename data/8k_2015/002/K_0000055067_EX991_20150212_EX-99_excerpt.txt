KELLOGG COMPANY REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2014 RESULTS,  

PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR 2015, AND CHANGES ITS LONG-TERM SALES TARGET  

BATTLE CREEK, Mich. – Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) today announced that fourth quarter 2014 reported net sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of 0.3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter comparable net sales* decreased by 2.2 percent. Full-year 2014 reported net sales decreased by 1.4 percent to $14.6 billion. Full-year comparable net sales decreased by 2.0 percent. Comparable net sales results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation, acquisitions, dispositions, costs associated with the efficiency-and-effectiveness program (Project K), differences in the number of shipping days, and integration costs.  

The reported quarterly operating loss was $422 million; this included a significant non-cash mark-to-market adjustment of $822 million, which was primarily driven by the impact that changes in interest rates had on pension plans; comparable operating profit* decreased by 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Comparable results for operating profit exclude the effects of foreign currency translation, acquisitions, dispositions, Project K costs, mark-to-market accounting, differences in the number of shipping days, integration costs, and other factors that affect comparability. Full-year reported operating profit decreased by 63.9 percent; this included significant impacts from the effect of mark-to-market adjustments and costs associated with Project K. Full-year comparable operating profit decreased by 3.9 percent.  

 * Comparable sales growth, comparable operating profit growth, comparable earnings, currency-neutral comparable earnings, comparable effective tax rate and cash flow are all non-GAAP financial measures. See the tables herein for important information regarding these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure.

Cash flow  

Cash flow*, a non-GAAP measure defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $1.2 billion for the full year; this was greater than expected and was due to improved working capital and changes to tax legislation. Kellogg repurchased approximately $690 million of shares during the year.  

Kellogg Issues Guidance for 2015  

The company issued guidance for comparable net sales in 2015, which are expected to remain approximately unchanged year-over-year. Kellogg expects full-year 2015 comparable operating profit to decrease at a rate between two and four percent; this includes a negative impact of between three and four percentage points from the rebasing of incentive compensation for 2015. Full-year 2015 currency-neutral comparable earnings per share are anticipated to be in a range between two percent lower and approximately unchanged; this estimate also includes a negative impact of between three and four percentage points from the rebasing of incentive compensation for 2015. Guidance for both operating profit and earnings per share excludes the impact of mark-to-market adjustments, 2014’s 53rd week, integration costs, costs related to Project K, acquisitions, dispositions, foreign-currency translation, and other items that could affect comparability. Cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.0 billion, which includes the cash required by Project K.  

Kellogg Announces a Change to Its Long-Term Sales Target  

The company also announced that it is making a change to its long-term financial targets. It now expects low-single-digit (one to three percent) comparable annual revenue growth, lower than the previous target of between three and four percent growth. The company’s targets for mid-single-digit (four to six percent) annual comparable operating profit growth and high-single-digit (seven to nine percent) annual, currency-neutral comparable earnings per share growth remain unchanged.

The resulting gains/losses are recognized in the quarter they occur.  

 (c) Costs incurred related primarily to execution of Project K, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program. The focus of the program will be to strengthen existing businesses in core markets, increase growth in developing and emerging markets, and drive an increased level of value-added innovation. The program is expected to provide a number of benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the implementation of global business services, and a new global focus on categories. Prior periods presented have been recast to exclude all restructuring and cost reduction activities from comparable results.
