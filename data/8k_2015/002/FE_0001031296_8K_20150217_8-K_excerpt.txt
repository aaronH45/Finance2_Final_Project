Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On February 17, 2015, FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy) issued two public documents regarding, among other things, results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2014 and operating earnings guidance for 2015. FirstEnergy’s Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference, contain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G and Item 10(e)(i) of Regulation S-K, FirstEnergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The information in the Press Release and the Consolidated Report to the Financial Community and the information contained in this Item 2.02 and in Items 7.01 and 9.01 below shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall such information and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

The Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community contain references to non-GAAP financial measures including, among others, Operating earnings, Adjusted Equity, Adjusted Debt and Adjusted Capitalization. In addition, Basic EPS and Basic EPS-Operating, each calculated on a segment basis, are also non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Operating earnings are not calculated in accordance with GAAP because they exclude the impact of “special items”. Basic EPS for each segment is calculated by dividing segment net income (loss) on a GAAP basis by the basic weighted average shares outstanding for the period. Basic EPS-Operating for each segment is calculated by dividing segment Operating earnings (losses), which exclude special items as discussed above, by the basic weighted average shares outstanding for the period. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures such as Operating earnings to evaluate the company’s performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Additionally, management uses Basic EPS and Basic-EPS Operating by segment to further evaluate FirstEnergy’s performance by segment and references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of “Operating earnings,” “Basic EPS” and “Basic EPS-Operating” provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends. Management uses Adjusted Equity, Adjusted Debt, and Adjusted Capitalization to calculate and monitor its compliance with the debt to total capitalization financial covenant under the FirstEnergy credit facility and term loan. These financial measures, as calculated in accordance with the FirstEnergy credit facility and term loan, help shareholders understand FirstEnergy's compliance with, and incremental debt capacity under, the debt to total capitalization financial covenant. The financial covenant requires FirstEnergy to maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 65%, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. All of these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to complement, and are not considered as alternatives to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure

On February 17, 2015, FirstEnergy expects to post to its website at www.firstenergycorp.com/ir the investor FactBook, which has been, among other things, updated in certain respects with information as of the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2014 and operating earnings guidance for 2015.
