In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the company continued to restructure its debt, resulting in aggregate losses of $30 million. The debt restructure transactions included settlements of conversions of the company's 2031B Notes for $389 million in cash; repurchases of $36 million principal amount the company's 2032 series notes in privately-negotiated transactions for $125 million; and the repayment of a $121 million note prior to its scheduled maturity. In the fourth and first quarters of fiscal 2014, the company recognized losses of $13 million and $75 million, respectively, from transactions to restructure its debt, including conversions, settlements, repurchases and exchange transactions.

The company previously held an equity interest in Aptina Imaging Corporation ("Aptina"), which was accounted for under the equity method. On August 15, 2014, ON Semiconductor Corporation completed its acquisition of Aptina. In connection therewith, the Company recognized a gain of $119 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 based on its diluted ownership interest in Aptina of approximately 27%.

Other non-operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 included a gain of $93 million recognized in connection with the issuance of common shares by Inotera Memory, Inc., an equity method investment of the company, in May 2014. As a result of the issuance, the company's interest in Inotera decreased to 33% in May 2014.

(3)Income taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 included $38 million and $72 million, respectively, related to the utilization of deferred tax assets as a result of MMJ's and MMT's operations. Income taxes for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 also included benefits aggregating approximately $190 million resulting from increases in amounts of net deferred tax assets expected to be utilized by MMJ and MMT. Remaining taxes for fiscal 2015 and 2014 primarily reflect taxes on the company's other non-U.S. operations. The company has a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset associated with its U.S. operations. The provision (benefit) for taxes on U.S. operations for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP RESULTS

(in millions except per share amounts)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The table above sets forth non-GAAP net income attributable to Micron, diluted shares and diluted earnings per share. The adjustments above may or may not be infrequent or nonrecurring in nature but are a result of periodic or non-core operating activities of the company. The company believes this non-GAAP information is helpful to understanding trends and in analyzing the company's operating results and earnings. The company is providing this information to investors to assist in performing analyses of the company's operating results. When evaluating performance and making decisions on how to allocate company resources, management uses this non-GAAP information and believes investors should have access to similar data when making their investment decisions. The presentation of these adjusted amounts vary from numbers presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies.

The company's management excludes the following items in analyzing the company's operating results and understanding trends in the company's earnings:

•Tessera license;

•Restructure and asset impairments, including impairment of equity method investments;

•Amortization of debt discount and other costs, including the accretion of non-cash interest expense associated with the company's convertible debt and the MMJ installment debt;

•Loss on restructure of debt;

•(Gain) loss from changes in currency exchange rates;

•Gain from disposition of shares in Aptina;

•Gain from Inotera issuance of shares;

•The estimated tax effects of above items; and

•Non-cash taxes resulting from utilization of, and other changes in, deferred tax assets of MMJ and MMT.

Non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact, based on the average share price for the quarter, of the company's outstanding capped call transactions, which are anti-dilutive in GAAP earnings per share but are expected to mitigate the dilutive effect of the company's convertible notes.
