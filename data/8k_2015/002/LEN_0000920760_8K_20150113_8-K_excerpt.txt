d) Election of Directors

On January 13, 2015, our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, elected Armando Olivera to serve as a director for a term of office expiring at our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, at which time his continued Board service will be subject to renomination and stockholder approval. Mr. Olivera’s term of office is effective January 13, 2015. Mr. Olivera has not been assigned to any Committees of the Board. Mr. Olivera was President of Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc. and one of the largest investor-owned electric utilities in the nation, from June 2003, and Chief Executive Officer from July 2008, until his retirement in May 2012. 

The Board has determined that Mr. Olivera qualifies as independent under the independence standards set forth in the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Olivera and any other persons with respect to his appointment as a director. Neither Mr. Olivera nor any immediate family member of Mr. Olivera has been a participant in any transaction or currently proposed transaction with the Company that is reportable under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

Mr. Olivera will participate in our outside director compensation program described under the heading “Director Compensation” in our 2014 Proxy Statement, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2014. Accordingly, Mr. Olivera will receive the annual equity grant of Lennar’s Class A common stock, options for Lennar’s Class A common stock, and the outside director retainer, each prorated based on his period of service.

A press release announcing Mr. Olivera’s election to the Board is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.
