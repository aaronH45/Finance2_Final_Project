CENTERPOINT ENERGY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND  

FULL YEAR 2014 EARNINGS  

   •   Strong financial and operational performance  

   •   Customer growth continues: nearly 55,000 new metered electric customers and 36,000 new gas customers  

   •   2014 utility operations capital spending up 14% versus 2013  

Houston, TX – February 26, 2015 - CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $176 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2014, which included a tax benefit of $0.07 per diluted share, compared to $113 million, or $0.26 per diluted share the previous year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $221 million, compared to $211 million in the prior year. CenterPoint Energy reports its investment in midstream operations as equity income rather than operating income. Midstream Investments equity income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $67 million, compared to $66 million in the prior year.  

For the year ended December 31, 2014, net income was $611 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, including the tax benefit referenced above. For the year ended December 31, 2013, net income was $311 million, or $0.72 per diluted share. The results for 2013 include two unusual items related to the formation of the midstream partnership: (i) a $225 million non-cash deferred tax charge and (ii) $13 million of pre-tax partnership formation expenses. Excluding the effects of these unusual items, net income for 2013 would have been $544 million, or $1.26 per diluted share.  

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $935 million. As a result of the May 1, 2013, formation of Enable Midstream Partners, operating income for full year 2014 is not comparable to prior results.  

“I am very pleased with our performance in 2014. Our Utility Operations delivered solid results, with a particularly strong financial performance from Gas Operations. Enable Midstream performed well in their first full year of operations delivering financial results in line with our expectations,” said Scott M. Prochazka, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. “We will continue to execute our utility strategy focused on organic capital investment in support of enhanced system reliability, ongoing system maintenance and upgrades, and continued growth in our service territories. This investment, along with timely recovery, will position us well for future utility operations earnings growth. Further, we remain confident in Enable Midstream’s ability to execute their business plan and continue to pursue growth opportunities in a lower energy commodity price environment.”

Electric Transmission & Distribution  

The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $113 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, consisting of $85 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $28 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $119 million, consisting of $87 million from the TDU and $32 million related to securitization bonds.  

Fourth quarter operating income for the TDU benefited from continued strong customer growth, as well as a higher energy efficiency performance bonus, equity return primarily related to true-up proceeds and net transmission related revenue. These increases were more than offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses, decreased usage due to milder weather and lower right-of-way revenue.  

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $595 million, consisting of $477 million from the TDU and $118 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2013 was $607 million, consisting of $474 million from the TDU and $133 million related to securitization bonds.  

Full year 2014 operating income for the TDU benefited from revenue increases associated with the growth of nearly 55,000 metered customers, as well as a higher energy efficiency performance bonus and equity return primarily related to true-up proceeds. These increases were partially offset by milder weather, as well as higher operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation.  

Natural Gas Distribution  

The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $103 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $94 million for the same period of 2013. Operating income benefited from rate changes and increased economic activity across its footprint as well as a higher conservation improvement performance bonus. These increases were partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and other taxes.  

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $287 million, compared to $263 million for the same period of 2013. Operating income benefited from colder weather compared to the previous year as well as rate changes and increased economic activity across its footprint, including growth of nearly 36,000 customers. Increases in operation and maintenance expenses as well as depreciation and other taxes partially offset these improvements.  

Energy Services  

The energy services segment reported operating income of $9 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $1 million for the same period of 2013. Fourth quarter operating income for 2014 included a mark-to-market accounting gain of $6 million, compared to a charge of $9 million for the same period of 2013.

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $52 million, compared to $13 million for the same period of 2013. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014, included a mark-to-market accounting gain of $29 million, compared to a charge of $2 million for the same period of 2013. The increase in operating income was primarily due to improved margins resulting from optimization of existing gas transportation assets, reduced fixed costs and increased throughput and price volatility due to colder weather.  

Other Operations  

The other operations segment reported an operating loss of $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to an operating loss of $3 million for the same period of 2013. The results for the fourth quarter 2014 included a pension curtailment loss associated with the transfer of seconded employees to Enable Midstream Partners. For the year ended December 31, 2014, this segment reported operating income of $1 million, compared to an operating loss of $18 million for the same period of 2013. The results for 2013 included one-time expenses associated with the formation of Enable Midstream as well as higher property taxes.  

Interstate Pipelines/ Field Services  

In May 2013, the company contributed substantially all of its midstream assets to Enable Midstream Partners. For the year ended December 31, 2014, this segment reported no operating income. Prior to the formation of Enable Midstream on May 1, 2013, the interstate pipelines segment reported operating income of $72 million and equity earnings of $7 million from its 50 percent interest in the Southeast Supply Header (SESH) and the field services segment reported operating income of $73 million during 2013.  

Midstream Investments  

The midstream investment segment reported $67 million of equity income for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $66 million in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2014, this segment reported equity income of $308 million. See Enable Midstream’s earnings press release issued on February 18, 2015, for detailed results of operations.  

Dividend Declaration  

On January 22, 2015, CenterPoint Energy’s board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.2475 per share of common stock payable on March 10, 2015, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 13, 2015. This represents a 4.2 percent increase from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.2375 and a 19 percent increase since the formation of Enable Midstream in May 2013.  

Outlook for 2015  

CenterPoint Energy expects earnings on a guidance basis for 2015 Utility Operations to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.75 per diluted share. The Utility Operations guidance range considers

 performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates, and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and the related stocks, or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company’s energy service business.  

The company expects its 2015 earnings estimate from Midstream Investments to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.35 per diluted share. In providing this guidance, the company assumes a 55.4 percent limited partner ownership interest in Enable Midstream and includes the amortization of our basis differential in Enable Midstream. The company’s guidance takes into account such factors as Enable Midstream’s most recent public outlook for 2015 dated February 18, 2015, effective tax rates, and other factors. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as the impact of any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream’s unusual items.  

On a consolidated basis, CenterPoint Energy expects earnings on a guidance basis for 2015 to be in the range of $1.00 to $1.10 per diluted share.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In addition to presenting its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), CenterPoint Energy also provides guidance based on adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share to the basis used in providing 2014 guidance is provided in this news release.  

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on adjusted diluted earnings per share and believes that presenting this non-GAAP financial measure enhances an investor’s understanding of CenterPoint Energy’s overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods by excluding items that Management does not believe most accurately reflect its fundamental business performance, which items include the items reflected in the reconciliation table of this news release. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered as a supplement and complement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
