  Item 8.01. Other Events   

  On January 1, 2015, Assurant Specialty Property, a reporting segment of Assurant, Inc. ("the Company"), completed the sale of its general agency business and associated insurance carrier, American Reliable Insurance Company, to Global Indemnity Group, Inc., a subsidiary of Global Indemnity plc, for approximately $114 million in cash. Cash proceeds, along with additional capital releases, will be available for general corporate purposes, such as funding organic growth, making select acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders.

For the nine months ended 2014, the divested business accounted for approximately $187 million and $6 million of revenue and net income, respectively. The Company expects to record a net loss on the sale of approximately $20 million. The loss was primarily attributable to an allocation of Assurant Specialty Property's goodwill and transaction expenses and will be included in consolidated net income in the fourth quarter 2014.

Financial results for the divested business can be found under Financial Information in the Investor Relations section of assurant.com.
