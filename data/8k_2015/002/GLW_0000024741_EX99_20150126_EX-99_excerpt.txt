Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at Core Performance measures. We believe reporting Core Performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions. Core net sales, Core equity earnings of affiliated companies, Core income before income taxes, Core earnings, Core earnings per share, Core gross margin and Core gross margin percentage and Core selling, general and administrative expenses are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the Japanese yen, the impact of the purchased collars, average forward contracts and other yen-related transactions, acquisition-related costs, the 2013 results of the polysilicon business of our equity affiliate Dow Corning Corporation, discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation and regulatory expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments, and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP reporting measures. 

The following is an explanation of each adjustment that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each item:  

Items which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at Core Performance measures are as follows: 

  (1)   Constant-currency adjustments:  

    Constant-yen: Because a significant portion of Corning’s LCD glass business revenues and manufacturing costs are denominated in Japanese yen, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings of translating yen into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-yen basis mitigates the translation impact of the Japanese yen, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts. We use an internally derived management rate of ¥99, which is aligned to our yen portfolio of purchased collars, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the Japanese yen.  

    Constant-won: Following the Acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials and because a significant portion of Samsung Corning Precision Materials’(now Corning Precision Materials) costs are denominated in Korean won, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings from translating won into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-won basis mitigates the translation impact of the Korean won, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts without the variability caused by the fluctuations caused by changes in the rate of this currency. We use an internally derived management rate of 1,100, which is consistent with historical prior period averages of the won. We have not recast prior periods presented as the impact is not material to Corning in those periods.  

  (2)   Purchased and zero cost collars, average forward contracts and other yen-related transactions: We have excluded the impact of our yen-denominated purchased collars, average forward contracts, and other yen-related transactions for each period presented. Additionally, we are also excluding the impact of our portfolio of Korean won-denominated zero cost collars which we entered into in the second quarter of 2014. By aligning an internally derived rate with our portfolio of purchased collars and average forward contracts, and excluding other yen-related transactions and the constant-currency adjustments, we have materially mitigated the impact of changes in the Japanese yen and Korean won.  

  (3)   Results of Dow Corning’s consolidated subsidiary, Hemlock Semiconductor: In 2013, we excluded the results of Dow Corning’s consolidated subsidiary, Hemlock Semiconductor, a producer of polycrystalline silicon, to remove the operating and non-operating items and events which have caused severe unpredictability and instability in earnings beginning in 2012. These events were primarily driven by the macro-economic environment. Specifically, the negative impact of the determination by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), which imposes provisional anti-dumping duties on solar-grade polysilicon imports from the United States, and the impact of asset write-offs, offset by the benefit of large payments required under Hemlock Semiconductor customers’ “take-or-pay” contracts, are events that are unrelated to Dow Corning’s core operations, and that have, or could have, significant impacts to this business. Beginning in 2014, due to the stabilization of the polycrystalline silicon industry, we will no longer exclude the operating results of Hemlock Semiconductor from core performance measures.  

  (4)   Acquisition-related costs: These expenses include intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs.  

  (5)   Discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: This represents the removal of discrete adjustments attributable to changes in tax law and changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, as well as other non-operational tax-related adjustments, including an out of period adjustment in 2014. This item also includes the income tax effects of adjusting from GAAP earnings to core earnings.  

  (6)   Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: Includes amounts related to the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) asbestos litigation, adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and the settlement of litigation related to a small acquisition.

  (7)   Restructuring, impairment and other charges. This amount includes restructuring, impairment and other charges, as well as other expenses and disposal costs not classified as restructuring expense.  

  (8)   Liquidation of subsidiary: The partial impact of non-restructuring related items due to the decision to liquidate a consolidated subsidiary that is not significant.  

  (9)   Equity in earnings of affiliated companies: These adjustments relate to items which do not reflect expected on-going operating results of our affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges and settlements under “take-or-pay” contracts.  

  (10)   Impacts from the Acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials: Pre-acquisition gains and losses on previously held equity investment and other gains and losses related to the Acquisition, including post-combination expenses, fair value adjustments to the indemnity asset related to contingent consideration and the impact of the withholding tax on a dividend from Samsung Corning Precision Materials.  

  (11)   Pension mark-to-market adjustment: Mark-to-market pension gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates. In accordance with GAAP, Corning recognizes pension actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, for our defined benefit pension plans annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever a plan is remeasured or valuation estimates are finalized. Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from the estimates used to allocate the change in value of pension plans to expense throughout the year or when assumptions change, as they may each year. Significant factors that can contribute to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses include changes in discount rates, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, and other changes in actuarial assumptions such as life expectancy of plan participants. Management believes that pension actuarial gains and losses are primarily financing activities that are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets, and are not directly related to the underlying performance of our businesses.  

  (12)   Gain on change in control of equity investment: Gain as a result of certain changes to the shareholder agreement of an equity company, resulting in Corning having a controlling interest that requires consolidation of this investment.  

  (13)   Loss on repurchase of debt: In 2012, Corning recorded a loss on the repurchase of $13 million of our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2021, $11 million of our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2016, and $51 million of our 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2013.  

  (14)   Accumulated other comprehensive income: In 2012, Corning recorded a translation capital gain on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.
