Aimco expects property operating expenses before taxes, insurance, and utilities to be up approximately 1.25% in 2014. PROPERTY OPERATIONS (1) For Aimco and peers, results include all property operating costs, which is comprised of COE, taxes, insurance and utilities. Peer group consists of AvalonBay, Camden, Equity Residential, Essex, Home Properties, MAA, Post Properties and UDR. Data Source: SNL Financial.

5 Portfolio strategy seeks revenue growth with lower volatility PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT  Geographic diversification reduces concentration risk. • Invest in large, liquid markets with elements of asynchronicity in real estate cycles. • Allocate 95% of our total investment to 12 to 15 target markets. • Submarket and micro-market growth and income characteristics are critical to investment selection.  Price point diversification reduces exposure to competitive new supply. • Customers assess quality on a relative basis, that is rent for a specific community compared to the local average. • New supply is typically delivered at the highest price points in a market, which is most impactful to A quality assets. • In the real estate cycle of any market, building occurs until it is no longer profitable. • A diversified portfolio of A, B and C+ quality assets is less impacted by new supply.  Continuously upgrade portfolio through capital recycling. • Move to higher average price point: Communities at higher price points attract customers with better prospects; absolute price point impacts resident quality more than relative price point (i.e., A, B, C quality); focused on balancing resident quality and volatility of higher price points. • Sell Affordable properties and lowest rated Conventional properties: Lower average revenues per apartment home; lower NOI margins; located in submarkets with lower projected revenue growth. • Invest in redevelopment, property upgrades and acquisitions: Higher average revenues per apartment home; higher NOI margins; higher projected revenue growth. • Capital Replacement and property management expense: Relatively consistent across price points on a per apartment home basis; lower rent properties have significantly lower FCF margins.  

6 Methodical approach to investment selection  Portfolio strategy executed through leverage-neutral, tax-efficient paired trades when: the projected Free Cash Flow IRR of an investment is greater than the projected Free Cash Flow IRR of the property sold; and portfolio quality is enhanced.  Selective investments are made in markets where our current allocations are below our target (for example, Manhattan) and/or where we seek to upgrade our locations within a market (for example, Boston). 2012 – 2014 Paired Trade Activity PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT Sell Lowest Rated Properties Property Sales Conventional properties 64 Conventional apartment homes 20,221 Affordable properties 73 Affordable apartment homes 6,938 Gross proceeds (Aimco share) $1.7B Net proceeds (Aimco share) $0.9B Avg revenue per apartment home $892 Avg FCF IRR 6% - 7% Reinvest in Higher-Rent Properties Property Upgrades Acquisitions Investment $135M Properties acquired 13 Avg FCF IRR > 15% Apartment homes 1,930 Gross real estate value ~$525M Redevelopment Avg revenue per apartment home $1,620 Total multi-year net investment ~$755M Avg FCF IRR > 8% Avg revenue per apartment home ~ $2,700 Avg FCF IRR > 8% Partnership transactions 14 Gross real estate value ~$220M Development Avg FCF IRR > 10% Total multi-year net investment $190M Avg revenue per apartment home $3,700 Avg FCF IRR > 9%

With a lower AFFO payout ratio, Aimco’s level of retained earnings is among the highest of the apartment REITs. This high level of retained earnings funds the required amortization of our property debt.  Our property debt balances at maturity are almost $1 billion lower than current balances as scheduled amortization is paid from retained earnings. BALANCE SHEET (1) Peer group consists of AvalonBay, Camden, Equity Residential, Essex, Home Properties, MAA, Post Properties and UDR. Peer weighted average computed by Aimco based on 9/30/2014 debt and preferred equity balances, less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, divided by last twelve months recurring EBITDA (annualized 3Q 2014 for Essex due to the impact of the BRE transaction), all as reported by SNL Financial. Balances are adjusted to reflect company share of unconsolidated debt and NOI. For Aimco, leverage represents Aimco’s share of property debt, preferred equity and any balance on the revolving credit facility, reduced by Aimco’s share of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments in a securitization trust that holds Aimco property loans. (2) Refunding Risk is lower than Total Leverage because property debt balances are reduced by scheduled amortization funded from retained earnings and because perpetual preferred equity is not subject to mandatory refunding. Property debt amortization, Perpetual Preferred Equity Total Leverage / LTM EBITDA (1) Refunding Risk (2)  

12 Aimco’s balance sheet is the safest in the sector  Limit entity risk by avoiding recourse debt, of which Aimco has very little.  Reduce re-pricing risk by using fixed-rate loans and preferred stock.  Reduce refunding risk by laddering maturities of long-term, non-recourse, amortizing property loans with little or no near-term maturities and using perpetual preferred stock.  Hedge against inflation and cap rate expansion by using long-dated, fixed-rate leverage. BALANCE SHEET (1) Peer group consists of AvalonBay, Camden, Equity Residential, Essex, Home Properties, MAA, Post Properties and UDR. Data as of 9/30/2014.

14 Aimco’s business plan provides for significant value creation AIMCO VALUE CREATION Portfolio Management • Portfolio quality, as measured by average revenue per unit, increasing at a rate significantly higher than peers. • Free cash flow margins increasing at a rate of 2% per year for the last ten years. • Increasing exposure to low cap rate Coastal California markets from 29% to 33%. Balance Sheet • Working toward investment grade rating. (1) Source: SNL Financial. Measure is calculated by SNL based on closing share price and consensus NAV estimates as of January 6, 2015. Aimco believes consensus NAV estimates for the company are understated and the discount to its peers is greater than that reported by SNL Financial. (2) Projects started before 3Q 2014 add $1.50 of NAV per share over the two years 2014 and 2015. This reflects value creation of ~35%, which is comparable to the value creation Aimco expects on its redevelopment projects going forward.  Aimco’s shares trade at a 7% discount to the apartment peer weighted average(1) while NAV continues to grow.  Qualitative factors create opportunity for multiple expansion. Each year, Aimco funds from retained earnings ~$80M of property debt amortization, which creates $0.50 of NAV per share. Annual investment of $200- $300M, at value creation averaging ~35% of investment, adds ~$0.50 of NAV per share annually.(2) Aimco’s 2014 projected Same Store NOI growth of 5.25% is 78 basis points ahead of apartment peer average. NOI growth creates ~$3.50 of NAV per share. Property Operations Redevelopment Balance Sheet
