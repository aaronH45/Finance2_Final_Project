Eaton Reports Fourth Quarter Operating Earnings Per Share of $1.27, Up 18 Percent 

Operating Cash Flow in the Fourth Quarter a Record $944 Million; Full Year 2014 Operating Cash Flow Excluding Legal Settlements a Record $2.53 Billion

2015 Operating Earnings Per Share Expected To Be Between $4.75 and $5.05 Inclusive of $0.20 Negative Impact From Foreign Exchange

DUBLIN, Ireland … Power management company Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) today announced operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter of $1.27, which exclude charges of $0.04 per share to integrate recent acquisitions, an increase of 18 percent over the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales in the quarter were $5.6 billion, up 1 percent over the same period in 2013. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014, which exclude charges of $32 million to integrate recent acquisitions, were $602 million compared to $516 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

Alexander M. Cutler, Eaton chairman and chief executive officer, said, “We had a strong quarter, posting attractive organic growth, record fourth quarter segment margins of 15.9 percent, and operating earnings per share above the high end of our guidance range. Organic sales growth was 5 percent, the strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2011. Partially offsetting the strong organic growth was 3 percent from negative foreign exchange and 1 percent from the divestitures of two aerospace businesses during 2014. 

“We generated record operating cash flow of $944 million in the fourth quarter,” said Cutler. “For the full year, we generated operating cash flow, excluding the legal settlements concluded in the middle of the year, of $2.53 billion, an all-time record. We repurchased $326 million of shares in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year share repurchases to $650 million or about 2 percent of our shares outstanding at the start of 2014.” 

For the full year 2014, sales were a record $22.6 billion, 2 percent higher than in 2013. Excluding charges to integrate recent acquisitions, the legal settlements and the divestiture gain, operating earnings totaled a record $2.2 billion, up 13 percent over 2013. Operating earnings per share for 2014, excluding the same items, were a record $4.67, up 13 percent over 2013. 

“Our full year 2014 sales increase of 2 percent reflects organic growth of 4 percent, partially offset by 1 percent from negative foreign exchange and 1 percent from the divestitures,” said Cutler. “During 2014, our markets grew more slowly than we had expected. Despite that, operating earnings per share grew 13 percent, reflecting strong performance by our businesses as well as success in achieving the integration savings targeted from the Cooper acquisition. 

“Our board of directors will address the first quarter dividend at its meeting later this month,” said Cutler. 

“In 2015, we anticipate our organic revenues will grow between 3 and 4 percent,” said Cutler. “In light of the dramatic shifts in exchange rates during the second half of 2014 and carrying into 2015, we expect the impact of negative foreign exchange to be approximately 4 percent.

“In spite of the negative impact of foreign exchange and a higher anticipated tax rate, we expect that 2015 operating earnings per share will set another record,” said Cutler. “For the first quarter, operating earnings per share, which exclude an estimated $15 million of charges to integrate our recent acquisitions, are expected to be between $0.95 and $1.05 per share. For the full year 2015, we estimate that operating earnings per share, which exclude an estimated $45 million of charges to integrate our recent acquisitions, will be between $4.75 and $5.05 per share. Excluding the sizeable impact from expected negative foreign exchange during 2015, our operating earnings per share would be about $0.20 higher.”

EATON CORPORATION plc

NOTES TO THE FOURTH QUARTER 2014 EARNINGS RELEASE

Amounts are in millions of dollars unless indicated otherwise (per share data assume dilution).

Note 1. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

This earnings release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include operating cash flows excluding litigation settlement payments, operating earnings, operating earnings per ordinary share, and operating profit before acquisition integration charges and transaction costs for each business segment as well as corporate, each of which excludes amounts that differ from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of each of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in this earnings release. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they exclude transactions of an unusual nature, allowing investors to more easily compare Eaton Corporation plc's (Eaton or the Company) financial performance and liquidity period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton and each business segment.

During the second quarter of 2014, Eaton settled two litigation matters with ZF Meritor LLC and Meritor Transmission Corporation (collectively, Meritor) and Triumph Actuation Systems, LLC and other claimants (collectively, Triumph) for $500 and $147.5, respectively. 

During the second quarter of 2014, Eaton sold the Aerospace Power Distribution Management Solutions and Integrated Cockpit Solutions businesses to Safran for $270, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $154. 

Excluding pre-tax acquisition integration charges and transactions costs totaling $154, pre-tax cost totaling $644 for settlement of the Meritor, Triumph and related litigation, and a pre-tax gain of $154 from the Aerospace divestitures, operating earnings were $2.2 billion for 2014. Excluding $0.21 per share impact of acquisition integration charges and transaction costs, and $0.70 per share impact of the litigation settlements and gain from the divestitures, operating earnings per ordinary share were $4.67 for 2014. 

During 2014, operating cash flows of $1,878 would have been $2,532 excluding $654 of payments made during the third quarter for Meritor, Triumph and related litigation.

Note 2. ACQUISITION INTEGRATION CHARGES AND TRANSACTION COSTS

Eaton incurs integration charges and transaction costs related to acquired businesses. A summary of these charges follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Business segment integration charges in 2014 related primarily to the integration of Cooper Industries plc (Cooper), which Eaton acquired on November 30, 2012. Business segment integration charges in 2013 related primarily to the integrations of Cooper and Polimer Kaucuk Sanayi ve Pazarlama, which Eaton acquired on June 1, 2012. These charges were included in Cost of products sold or Selling and administrative expense, as appropriate. In Business Segment Information, the charges reduced Operating profit of the related business segment.

Corporate integration charges in 2014 and 2013 related to the acquisition of Cooper. These charges were included in Selling and administrative expense. In Business Segment Information, the charges were included in Other corporate expense - net. 

Acquisition-related transaction costs, such as investment banking, legal, and other professional fees, and costs associated with change in control agreements, are not included as a component of consideration transferred in an acquisition but are expensed as incurred. Acquisition-related transaction costs in 2013 related to the acquisition of Cooper and were included in Corporate above. These charges were included in Selling and administrative expense, Interest expense - net and Other corporate expense - net. In Business Segment Information, the charges were included in Interest expense - net and Other corporate expense - net. 

Note 3. INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 was expense of 3.9% compared to a benefit of 12.4% for the fourth quarter of 2013. The effective income tax rate for full year 2014 was a benefit of 2.4% compared to expense of 0.6% for full year 2013. Excluding the litigation settlements and related legal costs, as well as the gain on the sale of Eaton’s Aerospace Power Distribution Management Solutions and Integrated Cockpit Solutions businesses, all of which occurred in the second quarter of 2014, the effective tax rate for 2014 would have been expense of 5.2%. The increase in the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year 2014, excluding the previously mentioned litigation settlements and gain on the sale of businesses, is primarily due to greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions and increases in worldwide tax liabilities, partially offset by additional foreign tax credit utilization in the United States, utilization of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, and the effects associated with the acquisition of Cooper. The fourth quarter 2014 also benefited from the reenactment of the U.S. research and experimentation credit.
