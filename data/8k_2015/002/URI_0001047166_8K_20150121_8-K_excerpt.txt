Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On January 21, 2015, United Rentals, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release reporting its results of operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. A copy of the press release is being furnished with this report as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

Certain information concerning our business, financial results and 2015 outlook that the Company expects to use at certain investor meetings and presentations can be accessed currently on the Company’s website, www.unitedrentals.com. Such information will be maintained on the Company’s website for at least the period of its use at such meetings and presentations or until superseded by more current information.

The presentation includes certain financial measures - free cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”) - that are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of rental and non-rental equipment plus proceeds from sales of rental and non-rental equipment. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, interest expense-subordinated convertible debentures, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet and the gain/loss on sale of software subsidiary. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, asset impairment charge, the impact on interest expense related to the fair value adjustment of acquired RSC indebtedness, the impact on depreciation related to acquired RSC fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization and the loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and retirement of subordinated convertible debentures.

The presentation includes reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest generally accepted accounting principles financial measures. The Company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth; and (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, none of these measures should be considered as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or earnings per share under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or liquidity.
