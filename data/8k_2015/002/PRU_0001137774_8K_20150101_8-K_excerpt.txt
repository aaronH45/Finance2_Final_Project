Class B Stock Repurchase  

On January 2, 2015, Prudential Financial, Inc. (the “Company”) completed the repurchase and cancellation of all of the outstanding shares of its Class B Stock (the “Class B Repurchase”) as described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 2, 2014 (the “Prior Form 8-K”).  

Reinsurance Transaction  

On January 1, 2015, The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“Prudential Insurance”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a reinsurance agreement with its wholly owned subsidiary, Prudential Legacy Insurance Company of New Jersey (“PLIC”), providing for the reinsurance of substantially all of the outstanding liabilities of Prudential Insurance’s Closed Block into a statutory guaranteed separate account of PLIC as described in the Prior Form 8-K. Prior to entering into the reinsurance agreement, Prudential Insurance recaptured substantially all of the previously existing reinsurance arrangements with third party reinsurers and its affiliates involving the Closed Block as described in the Prior Form 8-K. Also, effective as of January 2, 2015, the Company terminated the $2 billion letter of credit facility that previously supported a portion of these recaptured reinsurance arrangements.  

Inter-Business Transfer and Allocation Policies  

In connection with the Class B Repurchase and the resulting elimination of the distinction between the Company’s Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as described in the Prior Form 8-K, on January 2, 2015, the Company terminated the inter-business transfer and allocation policies filed as Exhibit 4.3 to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 relating to payments, loans, capital contributions, transfers of assets and other transactions between the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses, and the allocation between the two businesses of tax costs and benefits.
