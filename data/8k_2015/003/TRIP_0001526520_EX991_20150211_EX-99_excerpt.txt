During the fourth quarter of 2014, TripAdvisor changed its reportable segments to reflect changes in the management reporting structure of the organization, primarily due to recent business acquisitions. The revised financial reporting structure includes two reportable segments: Hotel and Other. Our Hotel segment consists of services related to hotels, including click-based and display based advertising revenue from making hotel room nights, airline reservations and cruise reservations available for price comparison and booking as well as subscription-based products such as Business Listings, transaction-based products such as JetSetter and Tingo and other revenue related to hotels. Our Other reportable segment consists of the aggregation of three operating segments, which include our Attractions, Restaurants, and Vacation Rentals businesses. We believe this new segment structure provides better information to assess performance and to make resource allocation decisions.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement the financial measures presented in TripAdvisor’s press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), TripAdvisor also reports non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and free cash flow, which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company’s financial statements.  

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP net income” as net income before expenses related to stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets and non-recurring expenses, net of related tax effects.  

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP net income per diluted share” as non-GAAP net income divided by non-GAAP weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which included dilution from options per the treasury stock method and include all weighted average shares relating to RSUs in shares outstanding for Non-GAAP net income per diluted share.  

TripAdvisor defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income (loss) plus: (1) provision for income taxes; (2) other income (expense), net; (3) depreciation of property and equipment, including internal use software and website development; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) stock-based compensation; and (6) non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary metric by which management evaluates the performance of its business and on which internal budgets are based. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that are either not part of TripAdvisor’s core operations, such as non-recurring expenses or those costs that do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense, which is based on TripAdvisor’s estimates of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs and other factors and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures. Moreover, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. We believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and non-recurring expenses, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash that operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.  

TripAdvisor defines “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.  

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP Selling and Marketing”, “non-GAAP Technology and Content” and “non-GAAP General and Administrative” expenses as GAAP Selling and Marketing, GAAP Technology and Content and GAAP General and Administrative expenses, respectively, before stock-based compensation expense.  

TripAdvisor defines “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which are purchases of property and equipment, including capitalization of internal-use software development costs. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as these measures allow a more meaningful comparison of our projected cash earnings and performance with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, management uses these measures internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole.  

TripAdvisor provides these non-GAAP financial measures as additional information relating to TripAdvisor’s operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. The non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of TripAdvisor’s liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare TripAdvisor’s performance to that of other companies. TripAdvisor endeavors to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures.  

Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, we present a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure below.
