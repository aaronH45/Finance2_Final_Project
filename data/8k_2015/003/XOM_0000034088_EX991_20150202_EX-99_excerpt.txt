IRVING, Texas – February 2, 2015 – Exxon Mobil Corporation today announced estimated full‑year 2014 earnings of $32.5 billion compared with $32.6 billion a year earlier, reflecting the strength of its integrated business model in a lower price environment. 

“ExxonMobil’s results illustrate the value of our proven business model that integrates upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses,” said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our balanced portfolio uniquely positions ExxonMobil to deliver superior results throughout the commodity price cycle.” 

ExxonMobil completed a record eight major Upstream projects during the year, including the Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas project, and achieved its full‑year plan to produce 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day.  

Fourth quarter earnings were $6.6 billion, or $1.56 per diluted share, down from $8.4 billion in the year‑ago quarter. Lower commodity prices in the Upstream and higher planned maintenance costs in the Downstream were partially offset by improved Chemical margins.  

During 2014, the corporation distributed $23.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, resulting in a total shareholder distribution yield of 5.4 percent.

Fourth Quarter 2014 vs. Fourth Quarter 2013 

Upstream earnings were $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, down $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2013. Lower liquids realizations decreased earnings by $2.4 billion, while favorable volume effects increased earnings by $400 million. All other items increased earnings by a net $640 million, including U.S. deferred income tax effects and the recognition of a favorable arbitration ruling for expropriated Venezuela assets. 

On an oil‑equivalent basis, production decreased 3.8 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of the expiry of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession, production decreased 0.7 percent. 

Liquids production totaled 2.2 million barrels per day, down 53,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter of 2013. The Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry reduced volumes by 133,000 barrels per day. Excluding this impact, liquids production was up 80,000 barrels per day as project and work program contributions more than offset field decline and divestment impacts.

Fourth quarter natural gas production was 11.2 billion cubic feet per day, down 653 million cubic feet per day from 2013. Field decline, lower demand, and reduced entitlement volumes were partly offset by higher volumes from Papua New Guinea and work programs. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1.5 billion, $317 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. Non‑U.S. Upstream earnings were $4.0 billion, down $1.6 billion from the prior year. 

Downstream earnings were $497 million, down $419 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. Stronger marketing and non-U.S. refining margins, mostly offset by weaker U.S. refining margins, increased earnings by a net $40 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20 million. All other items, primarily higher expenses and unfavorable tax effects, decreased earnings by $480 million. Petroleum product sales of 5.8 million barrels per day were 149,000 barrels per day lower than the prior year's fourth quarter.  

The U.S. Downstream recorded a loss of $1 million, down $598 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. Non‑U.S. Downstream earnings of $498 million were $179 million higher than the prior year.  

Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion were $317 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. Margins increased earnings by $490 million, benefiting from lower feedstock costs. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $60 million. All other items, primarily unfavorable foreign exchange effects, decreased earnings by $110 million. Fourth quarter prime product sales of 5.7 million metric tons were 358,000 tons lower than the prior year's fourth quarter. 

Corporate and financing expenses were $622 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, up $360 million from the fourth quarter of 2013 due primarily to tax‑related impacts. 

During the fourth quarter of 2014, ExxonMobil purchased 36 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a cost of $3.3 billion. These purchases included $3.0 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to equal $1 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased, or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

Frequently Used Terms 

This press release includes cash flow from operations and asset sales, which is a non‑GAAP financial measure. Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in Attachment II. References to quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as “proved reserves” under SEC definitions. Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available through the “Investors” section of our website at exxonmobil.com.
