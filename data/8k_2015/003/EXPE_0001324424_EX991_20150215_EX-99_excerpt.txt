BELLEVUE, WA, February 16, 2015 – Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with AirAsia Berhad to purchase an additional 25% equity interest of AAE Travel Pte.

“Asia continues to be a fast-paced, growing market, and partnering with a powerful brand like AirAsia has been instrumental in driving the expansion of our business in the region,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, President and Chief Executive Officer, Expedia, Inc. “We continue to value and look forward to a great ongoing relationship with them as we bring our world-class technology and supply to travelers across Asia.”
