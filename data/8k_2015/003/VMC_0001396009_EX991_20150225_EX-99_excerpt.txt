What is normal demand? 31 Private Demand Public Demand Expectation does not assume the next cyclical peak in private construction Expectation does not assume new , extraordinary commitments to investing in the nation's infrastructure  1.4 million housing starts, versus 45 - year trend of 1.45 million starts  1.2 billion square feet of annual non - residential construction, versus 45 - year average of 1.3 billion  Mid - single digit growth in public highway funding (local, state and federal )  Continued modest growth in infrastructure spending driven by state and local tax revenue

 Contents 60 Capital allocation and structure  

 Four topics for discussion 61  Current & projected credit position  Capital allocation during the recovery phase  Near term and potential capital structure actions  Capital allocation and structure through the cycle  

Rapidly improving credit metrics 62 Our credit metrics should reach investment grade levels during 2015. Figures for 2015 - 17 assume ~$2 billion of debt outstanding and consensus EBITDA estimates. 1.6 2.0 2.5 3.4 4.3 6.8 2015P 2016P 13 14 2017P 2012 Debt/Adjusted EBITDA See Appendix for reconciliation Non - GAAP measures Note: FYE 13 is pro forma for the $506 million debt purchase completed Q1 14.  

Increasing flexibility through the recovery phase 63 Growing Excess Cash Additional Debt Capacity Ability to Fund Both Growth & Return of Capital  

 Capital allocation priorities during recovery phase 64 Operating CAPEX Financial strength and flexibility Progressive dividend growth with earnings Bolt - on acquisitions Current intent: Return remaining excess cash to shareholders, primarily via share repurchases  

Anticipated approach to share repurchases 65  Review excess cash position and outlook quarterly  Utilize open market repurchases: mix of opportunistic and time - period averaging  Assess and adjust authorization periodically  Report on activity quarterly  

Planned and potential capital structure 66 Planned action: Refinancing of maturities due over next five years  Refinance approximately $700M of nearer - term maturities  Additional detail on next slide Potential future action: Issuance of additional debt  Subject to investment - grade parameters and market conditions  Likely longer - dated maturities consistent with longer - lived assets  Proceeds could be used for : – Financing of bolt - on acquisitions – Further refinancing of nearer - term maturities – Repurchase of additional shares  

 Planned refinancing of near - term securities 67 Expected outcomes Expected actions  Issue new note(s), likely 8 - 10 year term  Increase size of 5 - year revolving credit facility  Use proceeds to tender or call portion of notes due in '16, '17 and '18  Use proceeds and/or available cash to pay maturity due in 2015  Overall debt level remains at ~$2 billion  Reduce maturities due over next 5 years by approximately $700 million  Better match average debt duration and fix/floating mix to our business and asset base  Lower weighted average coupon rate  Maintain strong liquidity  

Illustrative approach to capital allocation through the cycle 68 Maintain investment grade metrics/ratings and access to capital markets at all points in the cycle. Recovery Phase Expansion Phase  Accelerate dividend growth consistent with earnings  Return excess cash with preference for share repurchases  Fund growth preferably with debt  Maintain dividend  Strengthen balance sheet; prudently manage financial leverage  Return excess cash with preference for regular or special dividends  Fund growth preferably with equity

EBITDA is an acronym for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization and excludes discontinued operations. GAAP does not define EBITDA. Thus, it should not be considered as an alternative to any earnings measure defined by GAAP. We present this metric for the convenience of investment professionals who use this metric in their analysis, and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance. The investment community often uses this metric to assess the operating performance of a company's business. We use EBITDA to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company. Additionally, we adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from period to period. Reconciliations of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:
