CHESHIRE, Conn., January 29, 2015-- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. For the three months ended December 31, 2014, the Company reported net product sales of Soliris® (eculizumab) of $599 million, compared to $442 million for the same period in 2013. The year-on-year increase in Q4 net product sales of 36 percent reflected steady additions of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) commencing Soliris treatment.

Alexion is serving patients with PNH and aHUS in 50 countries. Both PNH and aHUS are severe and life-threatening ultra-rare disorders caused by chronic uncontrolled complement activation. 

“In 2014, we provided Soliris to an increasing number of patients with PNH and aHUS worldwide while simultaneously reaching several significant milestones across our pipeline. Most notably, we completed the regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe and Japan for asfotase alfa as a potential treatment for patients with HPP, commenced registration trials for eculizumab in patients with DGF, NMO and MG, and initiated clinical development of our first two molecules from our next-generation Soliris portfolio,” said Leonard Bell, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alexion. “Throughout 2015, we will focus on serving more patients with PNH and aHUS globally while also preparing for the launch of asfotase alfa. At the same time, we will advance our lead development programs as we drive toward as many as seven potential new indications or product approvals through 2018.”

About Soliris® (eculizumab) 

Soliris is a first-in-class terminal complement inhibitor developed from the laboratory through regulatory approval and commercialization by Alexion. Soliris is approved in the U.S. (2007), European Union (2007), Japan (2010) and other countries as the first and only treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) to reduce hemolysis. PNH is a debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening blood disorder, characterized by complement-mediated hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). Soliris is also approved in the U.S. (2011), European Union (2011), Japan (2013) and other countries as the first and only treatment for patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA (blood clots in small vessels). aHUS is a debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by complement-mediated TMA. Soliris is not indicated for the treatment of patients with Shiga-toxin E. coli-related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). For the breakthrough medical innovation in complement inhibition, Alexion and Soliris have received some of the pharmaceutical industry's highest honors: the Prix Galien USA (2008, Best Biotechnology Product) and France (2009, Rare Disease Treatment).

More information including the full U.S. prescribing information on Soliris is available at www.soliris.net.
