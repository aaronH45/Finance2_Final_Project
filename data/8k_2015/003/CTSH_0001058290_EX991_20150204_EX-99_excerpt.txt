Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 rose to $2.74 billion, up 16.4% from $2.36 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding fourth quarter revenue of $80.6 million from TriZetto, quarterly revenue was up 13.0% from the year-ago quarter. GAAP net income was $362.9 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $324.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2013. Diluted EPS on a non-GAAP basis was $0.67, compared to $0.59 in the fourth quarter of 2013. GAAP operating margin was 17.5% and non-GAAP operating margin was 19.4% for the fourth quarter. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.  

“Despite unfavorable European currency movements during the fourth quarter, we finished 2014 with strong revenue performance and believe we are well positioned to continue that momentum into 2015 on the strength of our integrated consulting, technology, digital and business services capabilities,” said Francisco D’Souza, Chief Executive Officer of Cognizant. “Business leaders globally are facing dramatically compressed innovation cycles and are challenged with the dual mandate of simultaneously achieving efficiency and innovation. They are turning to us as a partner that can help them re-imagine their businesses for the digital era.”  

“2014 was a significant year, marking 20 years of innovation and growth for Cognizant,” said Gordon Coburn, President. “Integration of our $2.8 billion acquisition of TriZetto, completed in the fourth quarter, is well underway and we’re excited by the healthcare opportunities we see. As we crossed the  

 200,000 employee mark, we’ve been able to recruit top talent from around the world, and believe we are in a unique position in the market to address a wide range of opportunities fueled by digital transformations across all of our industry segments, service lines and geographies.”  

Highlights – Full Year 2014  

   •   Revenue increased to $10.26 billion, up 16.1% from 2013. Excluding revenue from the acquisition of TriZetto, revenue was up 15.1% from 2013.

Forward-Looking Statements  

This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, our expectations regarding opportunities in the marketplace, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.  

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (“non-GAAP diluted EPS”). These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of Cognizant’s GAAP financial measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated. With respect to our expectations in the “First Quarter & Full Year 2015 Outlook” section above, reconciliation of non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to GAAP diluted EPS guidance cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses which are excluded from the non-GAAP diluted EPS. 

We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and acquisition-related charges, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Acquisition-related charges include, when applicable, amortization of purchased intangible assets included in the depreciation and amortization expense line on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, external deal costs, acquisition-related retention bonuses, integration costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, charges for impairment of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs. In addition to excluding stock-based compensation costs and acquisition-related charges, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also exclude net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses, inclusive of gains and losses on related foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Management believes providing investors with an operating view consistent with how it manages the company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the company. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making, to  

 evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Therefore, it is our belief that the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.  

A limitation of using non-GAAP measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and exclude costs that are recurring, namely stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, including amortization of purchased intangibles, and net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to allow investors to evaluate such non-GAAP financial measures.
