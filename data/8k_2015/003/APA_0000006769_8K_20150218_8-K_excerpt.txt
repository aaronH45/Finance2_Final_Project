 Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers  

On February 18, 2015, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the board of directors (the “Board”) of Apache Corporation (the “Company”) approved, the terms of the Apache Corporation Executive Termination Policy (the “Policy”). All executive officers of the Company are subject to the Policy, which provides for the payment of certain benefits in the event of an Involuntary Termination or termination upon a Change in Control (each, as defined in the Company’s 2011 Omnibus Plan).  

Pursuant to the Policy, in the event of an Involuntary Termination, executive officers are eligible to receive the following benefits:  

   •   base salary benefit:  

   ¡    two times base salary for the chief executive officer;  

   ¡    1.75 times base salary for executive vice presidents;  

   ¡    1.5 times base salary for senior vice presidents and regional vice presidents;  

   ¡    one times base salary for vice presidents;  

   •   prorated target bonus;  

   •   twelve months COBRA subsidy at active rates;  

   •   three years’ service credit toward retiree medical;  

   •   prorated vesting for restricted stock units and stock options and extension of exercise period to full life of original stock option award; and  

   •   prorated vesting based on time in performance period for performance shares provided the executive has participated in the performance program for at least one year of the performance period (calculated at the end of the performance period and, if a payout is warranted, paid in cash according to the performance program’s vesting schedule).  

In the event of a termination of employment upon a Change in Control, the chief executive officer of the Company will receive a year of annual base salary plus bonus, in addition to the benefits for which he is already eligible after a termination upon a Change in Control under the Company’s Income Continuance Plan. After a termination of employment upon a Change in Control, all other executive officers will receive no other benefits other than those already provided for under the Company’s Income Continuance Plan.
