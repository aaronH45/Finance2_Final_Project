F I R M O V E R V I E W Implications of separation scenario – Chase and J.P.

N O T E S Notes on non-GAAP financial measures 1. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. 2. Adjusted expense, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes firmwide legal expense and expense related to foreclosure-related matters (“FRM”). Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s tangible common equity divided by period-end common shares. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity and are used in facilitating comparisons of the Firm with competitors. 4. Common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, tier 1 capital, total capital, risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and the CET1, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the Basel III Advanced and Standardized Fully Phased-In rules, and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the U.S. final SLR rule, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Regulatory capital in the Capital Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis within JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. 48

The “% of 10-year LT mutual fund AUM in top 2 quartiles” analysis represents the proportion of assets in mutual funds that are ranked in the top 2 quartiles of their respective peer category on a 10-year basis as of December 31, 2014. The sources of these percentile rankings, peer category definitions for each fund and the asset values used in the calculations are: Lipper (U.S. and Taiwan-domiciled funds), Morningstar (UK, Luxembourg and Hong Kong-domiciled funds), Nomura (Japan-domiciled funds), and FundDoctor (South Korea-domiciled funds). The analysis includes only retail open-ended mutual funds that are ranked by the aforementioned sources. The analysis is based on percentile rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at the ‘primary share class’ level for Luxembourg, UK, and Hong Kong-domiciled funds and at the aggregate fund level for all other funds. The ‘primary share class’ is defined by Morningstar and denotes the share class considered the best proxy for the fund. Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one 'primary share class' territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to ‘Offshore Territories’ and ‘HK SFC Authorized’ funds only). The analysis excludes money market funds, Undiscovered Managers Fund, and Brazil and India- domiciled funds. The asset values were redenominated into USD using exchange rates sources by the aforementioned sources. The analysis pertains to percentage of assets under management, not percentage of funds. Past performance is not indicative of future performance, which may vary. 22. Source: Capgemini World Wealth Report 50

N O T E S Notes on slide 42: TLAC composition and calibration Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding Note: The estimate of Minimum Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”) reflects the Firm’s current understanding of how the Financial Stability Board’s (“FSB”) November 2014 consultative document on “Adequacy of loss-absorbing capacity of global systemically important banks in resolution” will be implemented in the United States. The estimate reflects certain assumptions regarding the inclusion or exclusion of certain liabilities, particularly with respect to items where further guidance is necessary, including but not limited to, the seniority of included and excluded liabilities, notes governed outside of the local law of the resolution entity, holdings of other Global Systemically Important Banks’ (“G-SIBs”) TLAC and structured notes as defined by the Firm. These assumptions may change as future regulatory guidance is received. In addition, while the current estimate includes a deduction in capital equal to the Firm’s 2.5% G-SIB capital surcharge, further deductions of capital equal to the incremental capital surcharges that may be required by the U.S. banking regulators in the future will be deducted; capital that will be deducted is expected to be met through growth in the Firm’s CET1 and will be reflected in the calculation accordingly 1. Based on Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In RWA of $1,619B; as of 12/31/2014 2. Includes approximately $5B Trust Preferred Securities 3.

Instruments identified as “TLAC eligible” reflect the Firm’s current understanding of the FSB’s November 2014 proposal 5. Excludes issuance of structured notes as defined by the Firm 6. This is a theoretical analysis for illustrative purposes only. It assumes current market spreads for potential incremental issuance and does not factor in any potential credit spread widening as a result of increased issuance. It also does not consider issuance needs for other purposes, such as changes in balance sheet. 59

S T R A T E G Y B Y B U S I N E S S Strategy Overview  CIB scale, completeness and global network facilitates an integrated client coverage model, leading to best-in-class ROEs  Optimize business mix while investing in core growth opportunities  Adapt to evolving regulatory landscape and market structure changes  Maintain expense discipline while absorbing increased regulatory and controls costs Strategy from last year New constraints need to be considered  The core elements of our strategy are still valid  Need to continue to optimize our strategy – including G-SIB  CIB taking action to achieve and maintain firmwide 4.0-4.5% G-SIB target Profitability Constraints Liquidity (e.g., LCR, NSFR) Balance Sheet CCAR Stress Test Portfolio Optimization Capital (e.g., SLR, G-SIB) Going forward 12

Trade Finance)  OTC derivatives notional  Level 3 assets  Trading assets & securities financing Banking & Investor Services  Most products are not meaningfully G-SIB sensitive (e.g., IB Fees)  Fine-tuning required in select areas (e.g., Prime Brokerage). We believe that can be achieved with limited financial impact  A few stand-alone businesses as currently operating could be significantly impacted (e.g., OTC client clearing, derivatives intermediation); Non-operating deposits are heavily impacted as well  Will work with clients to find the best solution in each area 1 CIB by business split as per internal hierarchy. 2 Banking includes Investment Banking fees, Treasury Services, and Lending. 3 Short-term wholesale funding. 4 OTC Derivatives; Level 3 assets; Trading book/AFS securities. 5 Cross-jurisdictional assets and liabilities. 6 Intra-financial assets and liabilities; Marketable securities. Comments Markets  Almost all businesses contribute to G-SIB score, but many of the most significant reduction levers are low cost (e.g., OTC notionals) 1 13  

S T R A T E G Y B Y B U S I N E S S Impact of implemented and proposed capital rules on the cost of OTC client clearing  Focused on building a leadership position to help our clients clear  Build expenses have preceded revenue; however, we expected attractive returns at scale and maturity  Our business case was not built on halo revenues or synergies with other business lines JPM OTC Client Clearing strategy prior to G-SIB and SLR  The cost of OTC clearing has changed for all clearing members that are G-SIB or SLR constrained  Illustrative analysis suggests a 10% market share equates to 3–6x of additional capital for a constrained institution Impact of capital rules on clearing economics  Current market economics are incompatible with capital rules in their current form for many of the leading clearing providers  Whether bound by SLR or G-SIB, capital requirements increase by a significant multiple  Non-bank affiliated clearers unlikely to have the size, scale and liquidity required to support material market share  Possible outcomes for the OTC derivatives clearing market:  Pricing increases to a multiple of its current level  Capital rules align more closely to economic risk  OTC clearing providers that are G-SIB or SLR constrained exit the market Potential outcomes for the industry G-SIB Impact 10% of industry Market share Weighting Factor Size $10.9B 0.01% 20% 0.5 Cross jurisdictional $1.3B 0.01% 10% 0.1 Interconnectedness $8.4B 0.08% 6.7% 1.1 Complexity $3.6T 0.41% 6.7% 5.4 Total G-SIB factor 7.1 Additional capital 3x – 6x SLR Impact 10% of Industry Segregated cash $2.5B PFE add on $8.4B Total leverage asset $10.9B Additional capital 5x – 6x 14

A S S E T M A N A G E M E N T Notes appendix Page 1 1. The “% of 10-year LT mutual fund AUM in top 2 quartiles” analysis represents the proportion of assets in mutual funds that are ranked in the top 2 quartiles of their respective peer category on a 10-year basis as of December 31, 2014. The sources of these percentile rankings, peer category definitions for each fund and the asset values used in the calculations are: Lipper (US and Taiwan-domiciled funds), Morningstar (UK, Luxembourg and Hong Kong-domiciled funds), Nomura (Japan-domiciled funds), and FundDoctor (South Korea-domiciled funds). The analysis includes only retail open-ended mutual funds that are ranked by the aforementioned sources. The analysis is based on percentile rankings at the share class level for US domiciled funds, at the ‘primary share class’ level for Luxembourg, UK, and Hong Kong-domiciled funds and at the aggregate fund level for all other funds. The ‘primary share class’ is defined by Morningstar and denotes the share class considered the best proxy for the fund. Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one 'primary share class' territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to ‘Offshore Territories’ and ‘HK SFC Authorized’ funds only). The analysis excludes money market funds, Undiscovered Managers Fund, and Brazil and India-domiciled funds. The asset values were redenominated into USD using exchange rates sources by the aforementioned sources. The analysis pertains to percentage of assets under management, not percentage of funds. Past performance is not indicative of future performance, which may vary Page 3 1. The “mutual funds with a 4/5 star rating” analysis is sourced from Morningstar for all funds with the exception of Japan-domiciled funds; Nomura was used for Japan-domiciled funds. The share class with the highest Morningstar star rating represents its respective fund. The Nomura star rating represents the aggregate fund. Other share classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings; the highest rated share class may not be available to all investors. All star ratings sourced from Morningstar reflect the Morningstar Overall RatingTM. For Japan-domiciled funds, the star rating is based on the Nomura 3-year star rating. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated by Morningstar nor Nomura and hence excluded from this analysis. Other funds which do not have a rating are also excluded from this analysis. Ratings are based on past performance and are not indicative of future results 23  

A S S E T M A N A G E M E N T Notes appendix Page 4 1. The “% of AUM over peer median” analysis represents the proportion of assets in mutual funds that are ranked above their respective peer category median on 3, 5, and 10 year basis as of December 31, 2014. The sources of these percentile rankings, peer category definitions for each fund and the asset values used in the calculations are: Lipper (US and Taiwan-domiciled funds), Morningstar (UK, Luxembourg and Hong Kong-domiciled funds), Nomura (Japan-domiciled funds), and FundDoctor (South Korea-domiciled funds). The analysis includes only retail open-ended mutual funds that are ranked by the aforementioned sources.

Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one 'primary share class' territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to ‘Offshore Territories’ and ‘HK SFC Authorized’ funds only). The equity, fixed income and multi-asset solution and all other classifications used in the illustration are based on J.P. Morgan’s own categorization. The analysis excludes money market funds, Undiscovered Managers Fund, and Brazil and India-domiciled funds. The asset values were redenominated into USD using exchange rates sources by the aforementioned sources. The analysis pertains to percentage of assets under management, not percentage of funds. Past performance is not indicative of future performance, which may vary 2. The “% of AUM over benchmark” analysis represents the proportion of Alternatives/Absolute Return assets in portfolios that are exceeding their respective benchmark (net of management fee) on a 3, 5 and 10 year basis as of December 31, 2014. The source for all data used is J.P. Morgan. It is calculated on a best efforts basis and is used for illustrative purposes only. It is considered preliminary and unaudited and not meant to represent an official performance composite of the Firm. This analysis includes mutual funds, commingled funds and segregated portfolios that are managed within the following products: US Hedge Funds, Highbridge Hedge Funds, Absolute Return & Opportunistic and Currency. Real Assets and Private Equity portfolios are excluded. The market values used to calculate the assets under management are sourced from J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Finance department. These market values may not be the same as the market values used to calculate the underlying portfolio performance. The source for performance measurement for all portfolios included in this analysis is J.P. Morgan. All portfolios that were terminated prior to December 31, 2014 have been excluded from this analysis. Any revisions or restatements to the underlying portfolio performance or asset figures are not reflected in the historical data points. Portfolios that do not yet have a 3, 5 or 10 year track record also have been excluded from the 3, 5, and 10 year analysis respectively. Portfolios that do not have an assigned benchmark (e.g., private equity, real assets) have been excluded from this analysis. Portfolios where performance or market value data that could not be verified were also excluded from this analysis. The underlying portfolio returns used in the analysis were stated in base currency. All market values were redenominated in USD. The analysis pertains to percentage of assets under management, not percentage of funds.
