Item 8.01Other Events

Today, YUM! Brands, Inc. (the "Company") announced that, after discussions with several of its largest shareholders, it will implement a “proxy access” by-law amendment to the Company's by-laws. This amendment, which the Company’s Board of Directors will adopt in the Spring of this year permits a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning 3% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials directors constituting up to 20% of the board, provided that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements that will be specified in the amended by-laws. As a result of the Company’s decision, Marco Consulting Group has agreed to withdraw its proxy access shareholder proposal from the Company’s proxy statement which will be filed and mailed to shareholders in March.
