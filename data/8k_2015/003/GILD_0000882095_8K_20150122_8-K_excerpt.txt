2014 Bonuses and 2015 Base Salaries 

On January 22, 2015, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of the Gilead Sciences, Inc. (the Company) set the base salaries for the 2015 fiscal year for the Company’s named executive officers from the proxy statement filed in connection with the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders (the Executive Officers). The Committee also determined their bonus awards for the completed 2014 fiscal year based on their individual performance and the Company’s attained level of certain financial and non-financial objectives established for that year. The independent members of the Board ratified the 2014 bonus and 2015 base salary of John C. Martin, Ph.D., the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The approved 2014 bonuses and 2015 base salaries for the Executive Officers are as follows:

 *   The number of shares actually granted may differ slightly due to rounding.   

The number of shares actually granted will be based on the fair value on the February 1, 2015 effective date. The independent members of the Board ratified the equity grants to Dr. Martin. The options will be granted under the Company’s 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the Plan), and will have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on January 30, 2015 since the February 1, 2015 effective date is a Sunday. The options will have a maximum term of ten years measured from such effective date. The performance share awards will be issued under the Plan and will have both a total shareholder return (TSR) tranche equal to 50% of the grant-date fair value of the award and a revenue tranche equal to the remaining 50% of such grant-date fair value and divided into three separate annual revenue subtranches. The TSR and revenue tranches of each award will be structured in substantially the same manner as the 2014 performance shares awards described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2014. 

Kevin Young was granted time-based restricted stock unit awards with a grant date fair value of $180,000*. The number of shares actually granted will be based on the fair value on the February 10, 2015 effective date. Mr. Young was also granted stock options with a grant date fair value of $180,000*. The options will be granted under the Plan and will have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 10, 2015. The options will have a maximum term of ten years measured from such effective date. 

 *   The number of shares actually granted may differ slightly due to rounding.
