     Earnings Commentary 4 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: Throughout this document, Iron Mountain will discuss (1) Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization, Intangible Impairments, (Gain) Loss on Disposal / Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net (Excluding Real Estate) and REIT Costs (Adjusted OIBDA), (2) Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted EPS), (3) Funds From Operations (FFO NAREIT), (4) FFO (Normalized), (5) Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) and (6) Storage Net Operating Income. These measures do not conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).

Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2014 Financial Results – Strong Fourth Quarter Operating Performance Driven by Solid Constant Dollar Storage Rental Growth and Continued Volume Gains – – Full-year Results in Line with Guidance Prior to the Impact of Currency Translation – – 2015 Guidance Updated to Reflect Impact of Foreign Currency, while C$ Expectations are Unchanged – Total reported revenues for the quarter were $778 million, compared with $768 million in 2013, while full-year total reported revenues were $3,118 million, compared with $3,025 million in 2013. On a constant dollar (C$) basis, total revenue growth for the quarter was 4.6%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5.2% and service revenue growth of 3.7%. For the year, C$ total revenue growth was 4.4%, driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5.4% and service revenue growth of 2.9%. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $220 million, compared with $195 million in 2013, while Adjusted OIBDA for the year was $926 million, compared with $895 million in 2013. Adjusted OIBDA for 2013 included $19 million of costs associated with the company’s restructuring in the fourth quarter and $23 million for the full year. Adjusted OIBDA for 2014 included $3.5 million of restructuring costs. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.25 per diluted share, compared with $0.21 per diluted share in 2013, while Adjusted EPS for the year was $1.36 per diluted share, compared with $1.40 per diluted share in 2013. Adjusted EPS for the quarter and full-year 2014 reflects a structural tax rate of 14.4%, while 2013 results have been restated to reflect a structural tax rate of 15.0%, for comparability with 2014, the year in which the company’s conversion to a REIT became effective. Both 2013 and 2014 Adjusted EPS include the impacts to Adjusted OIBDA noted above. GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $0.06 per share, primarily due to charges related to the early extinguishment of debt, which reduced GAAP EPS by $0.08 per share. GAAP EPS for 2014 of $1.67 per share includes net tax benefits related to the deferred tax adjustment and other taxes related to the company’s conversion to a REIT effective January 1, 2014, partially offset by incremental taxes related to foreign repatriation. Funds From Operations, or FFO (Normalized), per share was $0.52 for the quarter and $2.27 for the year. C$ total storage rental growth of 5.4% for 2014 reflected strong increases of 12.9% in the company’s International business (including 27.6% C$ growth in Emerging Markets) and storage rental growth in the North American Records and Information Management (RIM) and North American Data Management (DM) segments of 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively.     

     Earnings Commentary 5 In support of its strategic plan, during 2014, the company: Improved customer retention and increased positive volume growth by 0.5% in the North American Records Management (RM) business and 12.3% in the International business, supporting global Records Management net volume growth of 3.6%, Expanded revenue from Emerging Markets to 13.9% of total revenue in the quarter on a constant dollar basis, demonstrating progress toward the company’s goal to increase contribution from these markets to 16% by the end of 2016, Acquired 13 storage-related businesses and the records inventory of 14 document storage companies for total investment of approximately $189 million in 2014, with $125 million of the total consideration in emerging markets, and Expanded inventory space in the company’s underground and Boston Data Center facilities to support multiyear plan and ended year with strong commercial bookings and improved pipeline. “Our 2014 results reflect the sustainability of our storage rental business and the strong execution of our strategy to extend that durability with improved customer retention, a focus on new sales and continued volume gains,” said William L. Meaney, Iron Mountain’s president and chief executive officer. “During the fourth quarter, we made progress on key initiatives while delivering solid internal growth in both developed and emerging markets and continuing to grow our business in emerging markets. Our business fundamentals were strong and in line with our expectations, and we are pleased with our momentum moving into 2015.” Operations Review Operating performance continued to strengthen, with internal storage rental growth of 3.5% in the fourth quarter and 2.2% for the year. For 2014, internal storage rental gains in the International business were 6.3% (including 12.2% internal growth in emerging markets) and 0.3% and 2.3% in the North American RIM and North American DM segments, respectively. Foreign currency rate changes reduced reported storage rental revenue growth rates by 3.0% in the fourth quarter and 1.3% for the full year. As the company has previously noted, service revenues reflect a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and related transportation revenues, although in the North American RIM segment, the contribution from these core activities has stabilized in recent periods. Fourth quarter internal service revenue in North American RIM improved by 3.0% compared with the prior year, driven by growth in imaging revenue, higher revenue from non-recurring projects and a 9% increase in recycled paper pricing compared with the prior year. Financial Review Consolidated Adjusted OIBDA margins for the year of 29.7% included the 2013 restructuring costs noted earlier and ongoing REIT compliance costs. Adjusted OIBDA margins in the North American RIM segment remained strong at 38.5% for the year, and North American DM Adjusted OIBDA margins were 57.6%. The International business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in line with the company’s mid-20% target, with Adjusted OIBDA margins of 23.4% for the year. For 2014, real estate investment, including racking, totaled $200 million, acquisition spend was $189 million and other investments totaled $51 million. Maintenance capital expenditures were $77 million, or 2.5% of revenues for the year. The company had liquidity of more than $730 million primarily under its revolving credit facility and a net total lease adjusted leverage ratio of 5.4x at year end, as compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5x.     

     Earnings Commentary 6 The calculation for this ratio is net debt including the capitalized value of lease obligations divided by EBITDAR as defined in the company’s credit agreement. 2015 Guidance As noted in its preliminary 2015 guidance, the company expects C$ Total Reported Revenues and Adjusted OIBDA to be generally in line with its strategic plan. Adjusted EPS and FFO (Normalized) per share are expected to grow roughly in line with growth in Adjusted OIBDA, or 1% to 5% on a C$ basis. The company has updated its guidance for reported results to reflect the impact of the strengthening dollar, and details are available on page 10.     

     Company Profile Iron Mountain is a global leader in enterprise storage with a high-return, real estate-based, business model, yielding revenues over $3 billion per annum. The company provides storage and information management services to a high-quality, diversified customer base across numerous industries and government organizations. Iron Mountain serves over 155,000 customers, including more than 92% of the Fortune 1000, and no single customer accounts for more than 2% of revenues. Iron Mountain provides storage and information management services in 36 countries on five continents, storing 530 million cubic feet of records in a portfolio of approximately 1,100 facilities containing more than 67 million square feet of space. The company employs over 20,000 people. Iron Mountain is organized as a REIT and its financial model is based on the recurring nature of its storage rental revenues and the resulting storage net operating income (NOI). Supported by its consistent, predictable storage rental revenues, which have increased for 26 consecutive years, the company generates predictable, low volatility growth in key metrics such as storage NOI and AFFO. This fundamental financial characteristic provides stability through economic cycles. Iron Mountain has the opportunity to invest capital at attractive returns both domestically and internationally. The company believes that there remains a large un-vended opportunity that can support sustained storage volumes in developed markets such as North America and high growth opportunities in emerging markets that are just beginning to outsource their storage of physical documents.

     Financial Highlights 8 (1) Ordinary dividends per share for Q4 2014 and FY 2014 include a “catch-up” distribution of $0.255 per share or $53 million in total. The board declared a catch-up dividend because dividends in the first half of the year were declared and paid before the board had determined that we could elect REIT status effective January 1, 2014 and were lower than they otherwise would have been if the final determination to elect REIT status effective January 1, 2014 had been made prior to such distributions. The catch-up dividend brings the aggregate amount of ordinary distributions paid in 2014 to approximately $400 million. (2) Based on the payment date of November 4, 2014; declaration date was September 15, 2014 (3) Excludes $5.1 million of CapEx in FY 2014 related to the company’s REIT conversion (4) Includes Land, Buildings, Improvements, and Racking Structures (5) Includes CapEx related to service-related businesses, as well as corporate overhead support and office outfitting (6) Includes the sale of a stake in Iron Mountain India and the sale of the International Shredding Operations (in December 2014, the company divested operations in Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom).

     Appendix 30 Non-GAAP Measures Non-GAAP measures are supplemental metrics designed to enhance our disclosure and to provide additional information that we believe to be important for investors to consider when evaluating our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (“GAAP”), such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Adjusted Earnings Per Share, or Adjusted EPS Adjusted EPS is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding: (1) (gain) loss on the disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) other (income) expense, net; (4) REIT Costs; and (5) the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items. We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. We believe Adjusted EPS is of value to our current and potential investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods. Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO AFFO is defined as FFO (Normalized) excluding non-cash rent expense or income, plus depreciation on non-real estate assets, amortization expense (including amortization of deferred financing costs) and non-cash equity compensation expense, less maintenance capital expenditures. We believe AFFO is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate excess cash that may be used for reinvestment in the business, discretionary deployment in investments such as real estate or acquisition opportunities, returning of capital to our stockholders and voluntary prepayments of indebtedness. Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization, Intangible Impairments, and REIT Costs, or Adjusted OIBDA Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net, and REIT Costs. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA provides our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment.     

     Appendix Non-GAAP Measures (continued) Funds From Operations, or FFO (NAREIT), and FFO (Normalized) FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and us as net income excluding gains and losses on the sale or write-down of real estate assets plus depreciation on real estate assets. FFO does not give effect to real estate depreciation and amortization because these amounts are computed, under GAAP, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that FFO (Normalized) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. Our most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO (Normalized) is net income attributable to Iron Mountain. Although NAREIT has published a definition of FFO, modifications to the NAREIT calculation of FFO are common among REITs as companies seek to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their business. Our definition of FFO (Normalized) excludes other items that we believe do not appropriately reflect our underlying operations such as intangible impairment charges, other income and expense (including foreign exchange gains and losses), income and losses from discontinued operations, provision or benefit from deferred taxes and REIT Costs. Service Adjusted OIBDA Service Adjusted OIBDA is calculated by taking service revenues excluding terminations and permanent withdrawals less direct expenses and allocated overhead tied to the service business. Terminations and permanent withdrawals are excluded from this calculations as they are included in the Storage NOI calculation. Service Adjusted OIBDAR Service Adjusted OIBDA as defined above, excluding rent expense associated with the service business. This is provided to enable valuation of Service Adjusted OIBDA irrespective of whether the company’s properties are leased or owned. Related rent expense is provided in the Components of Value slide. Storage Net Operating Income, or Storage NOI Storage NOI is defined as revenue from rental activities (storage rental revenue, termination fees and permanent withdrawal fees) less storage rental costs. Storage rental costs include facility costs (excluding rent), storage rental labor, other storage costs and allocated overhead. Storage NOI is commonly used in the REIT industry and enables investors to understand and value the income generated from the company’s real estate. Rent expense is excluded to enable valuation of this income irrespective of whether the company’s properties are leased or owned. Related rent expense is provided in the Components of Value slide. 31

     Appendix 33 Definitions (continued) Capacity Measures Building Capacity – The maximum number of cubic feet of records or standard DPUs that can be stored in a given facility. Building Capacity Utilization – The number of cubic feet of records or standard DPUs in storage divided by the Building Capacity. Installed Racking Capacity – The storage capacity of the racking installed in a given facility. Capacity is generally measured in cubic feet or standard DPUs. Installed Racking Capacity Utilization – The number of cubic feet of records or standard DPUs in storage divided by the Installed Racking Capacity. Capital Expenditures – Our business requires capital expenditures to support our expected storage rental revenue and service revenue growth and ongoing operations, new products and services and increased profitability. The majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations. Additionally, we invest capital to acquire or construct real estate. We also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally relatively small and discretionary in nature. We categorize our capital expenditures as follows: Real Estate: Investment – These expenditures are primarily related to investments in land, buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures that expand our revenue capacity in existing or new geographies, replace a long-term operational obligation or create operational efficiencies. Maintenance – These expenditures are primarily related to the purchase or replacement of real estate assets such as buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures. Non-Real Estate: Investment – These expenditures support either (i) the growth of our business and/or increase our profitability by investing in either supporting assets such as carton storage systems, tape storage systems and containers, shredding plants and bins, and technology service storage and processing capacity, or (ii) they are directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition and enhancements that support our leadership position in the industry, including items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements.     

     Appendix 34 Definitions (continued) Capital Expenditures Non-Real Estate (continued) Maintenance – These expenditures are primarily related to the purchase or replacement of customer-facing assets such as containers and shred bins, warehouse equipment, fixtures, computer hardware, or third-party or internally-developed software assets. This category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements. Components of Overhead Allocated Overhead – Includes overhead expenses directly associated with storage and service business operations allocated as follows: Field Operation Costs – Allocated to storage and service operations based on percent of revenue. Bad Debt Expenses – Allocated to storage and service operations based on percent of revenue. Transportation Costs – Allocated fully to service operations. Corporate Overhead – Includes all other overhead expenses associated with business support functions, including: Executive, Legal, Real Estate/Facilities, Accounting, Financial Performance & Analysis, Treasury, Tax, Internal Audit, M&A, Security, Procurement, HR, REIT, Other G&A, Integration Costs, IT, Product Engineering and Product Management. Customer Turnover Overhead – Overhead associated with customer acquisition and retention including Sales, Marketing and Account Management expenses. Constant Dollar Growth (C$) – The year-over-year growth rate excluding the impact of changes to foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2013 results at the 2014 constant dollar budget rates. Destruction Rate – Calculated by dividing the total number of cubic feet of records removed from inventory due to destructions in a one-year period divided by the total number of cubic feet of records in storage at the beginning of the period. DPUs – Data protection units, a unit of measurement specific to our Data Protection storage services. Internal Revenue Growth – Internal revenue growth represents the year-over-year growth rate of revenues excluding the impacts of changes to foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and other unusual items. In general, only acquisitions that have been in our results for the full calendar year prior to the quarter of measurement are included in internal revenue growth.     

     Appendix 35 Definitions (continued) Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio – The calculation for this ratio is EBITDA plus rent expense divided by net debt including the capitalized value of lease obligations. Net Volume Growth – New Records Management storage volume from existing customers, plus volume from new customers and volume from acquisitions, offset by volume related to destructions, permanent withdrawals and customer terminations. Quarterly percentages are calculated by dividing the trailing four quarters’ total activity by the ending balance of the same prior-year period. Non-Cash Rent Expense – Calculated as rent expense less cash paid for rent. Permanent Withdrawal Rate – Calculated by dividing the total number of cubic feet of records removed from inventory due to permanent withdrawals in a one-year period divided by the total number of cubic feet of records in storage at the beginning of the period. Permanent withdrawals occur when records are permanently removed from inventory by customers for reasons other than the customer terminating its relationship. Racking Investment – The cumulative sum of investment to date for all approved racking projects in progress. REIT Costs – Includes costs associated with our 2011 proxy contest, the previous work of the former Strategic Review Special Committee of the board of directors and costs associated with the Company’s conversion to a REIT, excluding REIT compliance costs beginning January 1, 2014 which we expect to recur in future periods. REIT Countries – Countries where we operate that have been converted into a Qualified REIT Subsidiary and Taxable REIT Subsidiary structure, the group includes the following: Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. Regional NOI / CF or DPU – The average expected NOI for a specific region (NA, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pac) and product (Records Management or Data Protection).
