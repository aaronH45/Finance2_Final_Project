  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The information provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release, and does not incorporate the potential impact of any business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, financing arrangements, other investments, or other significant transactions that may be completed after the date of this release. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items provided include only those items that are known and can be estimated as of the date of this release. Actual results will vary from this model and the variations may be material. Reconciling items included above are as follows:  

   •   Gross margin - amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, $21 million.  

   •   Operating margin - amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, $37 million.  

   •   Earnings per share - amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, $37 million; amortization of convertible note discounts, $8 million; and associated tax benefit for non-GAAP items ($7) million; totaling $38 million.  

   •   Diluted share count - impact of a note hedge issued contemporaneously with the convertible notes due in 2016 and 2018, 3 million shares.  

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results  

In addition to GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results. The Company’s non-GAAP results for both the December 2014 and September 2014 quarters include the impact of the note hedge issued contemporaneously with the convertible notes due in 2016 and 2018 and exclude amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, the amortization of convertible note discounts, and tax expense (benefit) of non-GAAP items. Additionally, the December 2014 quarter non-GAAP results exclude acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments, cost of restructuring and tax benefit on reinstatement of research and development credit. The September 2014 quarter non-GAAP results also exclude the rationalization of certain product configurations, gain associated with disposition of a business, and tax benefit on valuation allowance adjustment.  

Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company’s operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors’ ability to view the Company’s results from management’s perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company’s web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.
