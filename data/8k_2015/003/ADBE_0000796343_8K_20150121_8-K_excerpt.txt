Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

On January 21, 2015, Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and RBS Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Underwriting Agreement provides for the issuance and sale by Adobe of $1,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3.250% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) 

The Notes were issued and sold in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-186144) (the “Registration Statement”) filed on January 23, 2013, a related preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 21, 2015, and a related final prospectus supplement filed on January 22, 2015. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by Adobe, and customary closing conditions, indemnification rights and termination provisions. 

The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes are approximately $[980.8] million after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. Adobe intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which, among other things, will include repaying $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Adobe’s 3.250% senior notes due 2015, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. 

The above description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

The material terms and conditions of the Notes are set forth in the Form of Officer’s Certificate filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated by reference herein and in the Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Registration Statement.
