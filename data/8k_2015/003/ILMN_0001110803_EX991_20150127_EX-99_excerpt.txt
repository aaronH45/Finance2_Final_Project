Financial outlook and guidance

The non-GAAP financial guidance discussed below reflects certain pro forma adjustments to assist in analyzing and assessing our core operational performance. Please see our Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Guidance included in this release for a reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

For fiscal 2015 the Company is projecting approximately 20% revenue growth, assuming current currency exchange rates, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.12 to $3.18. These projections assume full year non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 73%, and a pro forma tax rate of approximately 28%. Full-year weighted average diluted shares outstanding, for the measurement of pro forma amounts, is expected to be approximately 150 million shares.

Statement regarding use of non-GAAP financial measures

The Company reports non-GAAP results for diluted net income per share, net income, gross margins, operating expenses, operating margins, other income, and free cash flow in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The Company’s financial measures under GAAP include substantial charges related to stock compensation expense, legal contingencies, amortization of acquired intangible assets, non-cash interest expense associated with the Company’s convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash, acquisition related expense, and others that are listed in the itemized reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release. Per share amounts also include, through the first quarter of 2014, the double dilution associated with the accounting treatment of the Company’s 0.625% convertible senior notes and the corresponding call option overlay. Management believes that presentation of operating results that excludes these items and per share double dilution provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company’s core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Management also believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is therefore useful to investors in analyzing and assessing the Company’s past and future operating performance.

The Company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in the tables of this release.

(a) Net cash provided by operating activities excludes excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation of $126.5 million in fiscal 2014, of which $23.8 million was recorded in Q4, and $56.7 million in fiscal 2013, of which $29.5 million was recorded in Q4. Net cash used in financing activities reflects the excess tax benefit as a corresponding in-flow in the respective periods.

(b) Free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow is useful to management as it is one of the metrics used to evaluate our performance and to compare us with other companies in our industry. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.

(c) Non-cash interest expense is calculated in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash.

(d) Acquisition related gain, net consists primarily of net gains from changes in fair value of contingent consideration and transaction related costs. 

(e) Headquarter relocation for fiscal 2014 and 2013 consisted of accretion of interest expense on lease exit liability and changes in estimates of such liability. 

(f) Impairments in fiscal 2014 represent a net gain of $0.5 million, which consisted of a gain on an asset sale associated with a non-core product line discontinued in 2013, partially offset by an intangible asset impairment. Impairments in fiscal 2013 represent asset impairment charges recorded upon the decision to discontinue the non-core product line.
