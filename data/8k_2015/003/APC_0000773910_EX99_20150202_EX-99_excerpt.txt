These results include certain items typically excluded by the investment community in published estimates. In total, these items decreased net income by $582 million, or $1.15 per share (diluted), on an after-tax basis.(1) Cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.952 billion, and discretionary cash flow totaled $2.412 billion.(2) 

For the year ended Dec. 31, 2014, Anadarko reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1.750 billion, or $3.47 per share (diluted), which includes a net loss of $4.045 billion associated with the settlement of the Tronox Adversary Proceeding, after tax. Full-year 2014 cash flow from operating activities was $8.466 billion. Discretionary cash flow for the year totaled $9.404 billion.(2) 

2014 HIGHLIGHTS

•Delivered sales-volume growth of more than 11 percent, increasing year-over-year sales volumes by approximately 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day on a divestiture-adjusted basis (3) 

•Achieved a reserve-replacement ratio of more than 160 percent at competitive costs

•Accelerated more than $2.5 billion of value through asset monetizations

•Achieved significant progress on several large-scale projects, highlighted by the recent startup of the 80,000-barrels-of-oil-per-day (BOPD) Lucius spar in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico

“Anadarko’s fourth-quarter operating performance was a capstone to another terrific year for our company,” said Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO Al Walker. “In 2014, we demonstrated the quality of our portfolio by delivering results that exceeded the midpoint of our initial sales-volume guidance by approximately 38,000 BOE per day,(3) while staying well within our initial range of capital investment guidance and generating free cash flow.(2) This outperformance was primarily driven by results in the Wattenberg field, where we enhanced efficiencies in our drilling and completions and leveraged the competitive advantage of our expansive midstream infrastructure to significantly bolster our growth. We believe our efficient allocation of capital, active portfolio management and commitment

to financial discipline position Anadarko to deliver differentiating performance in the challenging current environment and as commodity prices recover.”

SALES VOLUMES AND PROVED RESERVES

Anadarko’s full-year sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) totaled a record 306 million BOE, or an average of 838,000 BOE per day, on a divestiture-adjusted basis.(3) Fourth-quarter 2014 sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs totaled 79 million BOE, or an average of 854,000 BOE per day.

Anadarko organically added 503 million BOE of proved reserves in 2014 before the effects of price revisions and incurred oil and natural gas exploration and development costs of approximately $8.8 billion.(2) The company estimates its proved reserves at year-end 2014 totaled approximately 2.86 billion BOE, with 69 percent of its reserves categorized as proved developed. At year-end 2014, Anadarko’s proved reserves were comprised of 49 percent liquids and 51 percent natural gas.

U.S. ONSHORE HIGHLIGHTS

In 2014, Anadarko’s U.S. onshore operating areas achieved a 16-percent year-over-year increase in total sales volumes, including an increase of 78,000 barrels per day in liquids volumes, and an approximate 50-percent increase, or 49,000 BOPD, in oil volumes on a divestiture-adjusted basis.(3) This growth was driven by record production in several major growth plays, including the Wattenberg field, Eagleford Shale and Wolfcamp Shale.

Anadarko’s Wattenberg field in Colorado continued to demonstrate excellent performance as the company achieved year-over-year growth of approximately 55 percent, increasing sales volumes by more than 60,000 BOE per day over its 2013 average of 109,000 BOE per day. Significant infrastructure was placed in service in the field during the year, including the Lancaster cryogenic plant, Front Range NGL pipeline and more than 300 million cubic feet per day of additional field compression. These expansions, coupled with continued strong reservoir performance and enhanced drilling and completions efficiencies, underpinned Wattenberg’s production growth.

In the Delaware Basin in West Texas, the company exited the year with ten operated rigs and continued its successful evaluation of the extensive Wolfcamp Shale oil opportunity. Anadarko continues to expand key infrastructure to facilitate future growth from the basin, including the integration of the Nuevo Midstream assets acquired by Anadarko’s midstream limited partnership, Western Gas Partners, LP (WES).

INTERNATIONAL AND DEEPWATER HIGHLIGHTS

In 2014, Anadarko advanced multiple significant mega projects and achieved a net production record at the El Merk project in Algeria. The company commissioned the 80,000-BOPD Lucius facility in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and achieved first oil on Jan. 16, 2015 - just over three years from project sanction. Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the 80,000-BOPD Heidelberg project remains on track for first oil in 2016, as construction on the topsides is more than 70-percent complete, and two deepwater drilling rigs are actively drilling development wells in the field. In addition, Anadarko’s non-operated 80,000-barrels-per-day TEN development offshore Ghana also remains on schedule with first production expected in 2016, and new gas-handling infrastructure was completed in the adjacent Jubilee field during the fourth quarter, which is expected to enable increased oil production beginning in 2015.

During the fourth quarter, the Government of Mozambique gazetted the Decree Law, which is an important step in providing the appropriate framework for a stable business environment for investors, customers, financiers and construction contractors as Anadarko advances its large-scale LNG project. Anadarko and its partners in Mozambique’s Offshore Area 1 have continued to advance long-term LNG sales agreements with the recent addition of new non-binding Heads of Agreement (HOAs) with customers in Asian markets. With these new agreements, the partners have HOAs in place covering a total of more than 8 million tonnes per annum.

Anadarko also maintained an active exploration and appraisal program during the year, laying the foundation for potential future mega projects. Appraisal activity offshore Côte d’Ivoire at the Paon discovery and in the Gulf of Mexico at the Shenandoah discovery continued to validate the company’s geologic models around these apparent commercial discoveries.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures

Below are reconciliations of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP) to adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP), cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to discretionary cash flow from operations (non-GAAP), as well as free cash flow (non-GAAP) as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Company’s operational trends and performance.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures

Management uses discretionary cash flow from operations because it is useful in comparisons of oil and gas exploration and production companies as it excludes certain fluctuations in assets and liabilities and current taxes related to certain items affecting comparability. Management uses free cash flow to demonstrate the Company’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures

Presented below are reconciliations of costs incurred (GAAP) to oil and natural gas exploration and development costs (non-GAAP) and total debt (GAAP) to net debt (non-GAAP). Management believes oil and natural gas exploration and development costs is a more accurate reflection of the expenditures incurred during the current year, excluding certain obligations to be paid in future periods. Management uses net debt as a measure of the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand.
