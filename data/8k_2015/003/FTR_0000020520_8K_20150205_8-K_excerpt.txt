 ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT  

On February 5, 2015, Frontier Communications Corporation (the “Company”) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”), pursuant to which the Company has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of a limited liability company to be formed by Verizon (“Newco”), which will hold the outstanding limited liability company interests and capital stock of Verizon Florida LLC, GTE Southwest Incorporated and Verizon California Inc. (collectively with Newco, the “Transferred Companies”), from Verizon for a purchase price of $10.54 billion in cash, plus (x) any amount required to be paid, refunded, deferred, escrowed or foregone by Verizon as a condition to obtaining any required governmental consents in California, Texas or Florida (collectively the “States”) to consummate the transaction, minus (y) the amount of the net indebtedness of the Transferred Companies (together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon) at closing, minus (z) any adjustment to the purchase price if the total revenues set forth in the audited 2014 financial statements of the Transferred Business (as defined below) are less than a specified amount. The purchase price is also subject to a customary adjustment based on the net working capital of the Transferred Companies at closing. The Company and Verizon have agreed to treat the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes as an acquisition and sale of all of the assets of the Transferred Companies. The Transferred Companies operate, among other things, Verizon’s wireline business and statewide fiber network that provides services to residential, commercial and wholesale customers in the States. As part of the transaction, the Company will also acquire certain FiOS video customers in the States.  

Prior to the closing under the Securities Purchase Agreement, (i) Verizon will transfer to the Transferred Companies certain assets and cause the Transferred Companies to assume certain liabilities relating to the business to be acquired and (ii) the Transferred Companies will transfer to Verizon certain assets, and Verizon will assume certain liabilities of the Transferred Companies, to be retained by Verizon following the closing (the Transferred Companies, taking into account such transactions, being referred to as the “Transferred Business”).  

Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including (i) expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (ii) receipt of the necessary approvals required to be obtained from the Federal Communications Commission, the California Public Utility Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Texas, and (iii) receipt of such other approvals required to be obtained from certain other state and local regulatory bodies, except for those approvals the failure of which to be obtained would not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse in relation to the Transferred Business.  

The Company’s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement is also subject to, among other things, (i) the completion of an extraction of customer data for the Transferred Business that meets certain requirements, (ii) Verizon’s delivery of certain financial statements and unqualified auditor reports related thereto required to be delivered pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement prior to the closing and (iii) the absence of a Seller Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) after the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement. In addition, the Company is not obligated to proceed with the closing under the Securities Purchase Agreement until the third business day following the Marketing Period Termination Date (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement).  

The parties to the Securities Purchase Agreement have made to each other certain representations and warranties, and have agreed to certain covenants and agreements, including with respect to cooperation, regulatory approvals, the financial statements for the Transferred Business, the Company’s financing of the transaction, the conduct and operation of the Transferred Companies prior to the closing and similar matters. In addition, the Securities Purchase Agreement contemplates that Verizon and the Company will enter into certain ancillary agreements in connection with the transaction.  

Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, subject to certain limitations, Verizon has agreed to indemnify the Company from any losses incurred by the Company arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of representation or warranty made by Verizon, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Verizon, (iii) any Excluded Liabilities (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), (iv) any indebtedness of the Transferred Companies existing as of immediately prior to the Closing and not taken into account in the purchase price and (v) any universal service funding contributions that relate to the provision of services conducted by the business to be acquired prior to the closing. Subject to certain limitations, the Company has agreed to indemnify Verizon from any losses incurred by Verizon arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of representation or warranty made by the Company, (ii) except to the extent that Verizon has indemnification obligations with respect thereto, any Assumed Liabilities (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) or other liabilities that the Company has expressly agreed to assume pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, and (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company.  

The Securities Purchase Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances, including, among others, if the transaction does not close by April 5, 2016 (subject to extension to August 5, 2016 in certain circumstances). Additionally, either party may terminate the Securities Purchase Agreement upon a breach by the other party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by such breaching party in the Securities Purchase Agreement, such that the conditions related to the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by such breaching party would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of 60 days after written notice or the termination date of the Securities Purchase Agreement.  

In connection with the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company has entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”), dated February 5, 2015, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (such financial institutions being referred to as the “Commitment Parties”), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties have committed to provide two bridge loan facilities for a total amount of $11.594 billion for the purposes of funding (i) the cash consideration for the acquisition of the limited liability company interests of Newco and (ii) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement. The financing commitments of the Commitment Parties are subject to various conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter.  

This description of the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
