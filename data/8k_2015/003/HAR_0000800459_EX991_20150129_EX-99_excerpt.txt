STAMFORD, CT, January 29, 2015 – Harman International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE: HAR), the premier audio, visual, infotainment and enterprise automation group, today announced results for the second quarter ended December 31, 2014.  

Net sales for the second quarter were $1.58 billion, an increase of 19 percent compared to the same period in the prior year or 24 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Infotainment net sales increased 12 percent, or 18 percent excluding foreign currency translation (ex-FX), due to platform expansion, stronger automotive production, and higher take rates. Lifestyle net sales grew 26 percent (31 percent ex-FX) driven by strong demand for the Company’s home and multimedia product lines and increased automotive production levels and higher take rates in car audio. Net sales in the Professional division increased 29 percent (32 percent ex-FX) primarily as a result of the expansion of the Company’s product portfolio into enterprise automation and control and video switching.  

On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating income was $149 million, compared to $102 million in the same period in the prior year, and earnings per diluted share were $1.65 for the quarter compared to $1.03 in the same period in the prior year. Excluding restructuring and other non-recurring items, second quarter operating income was $162 million compared to $108 million in the same period in the prior year, and earnings per diluted share were $1.79 compared to $1.09 in the same period last year.  

“I am extremely pleased to report double-digit, top-line growth in each of HARMAN’s divisions, making this HARMAN’s sixth consecutive quarter of such outstanding performance. Despite foreign exchange headwinds, our fiscal year is off to a solid start with 21 percent year-to-date, top-line growth, driving over 150 basis point expansion of our EBITDA margin. As a result, we are raising our 2015 EPS guidance from $5.25 to $5.85,” said Dinesh C. Paliwal, the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are confident that the demand for a rich connected car experience is sustainable and will continue to drive take rates, particularly for embedded infotainment systems and branded car audio solutions.  

“Together with our progress in Infotainment and Professional, groundbreaking innovations in Lifestyle and on-going focus on disciplined execution, we are optimistic about the second half of fiscal year 2015,” added Paliwal. “Longer term, we have been reinforcing the importance of software and services to HARMAN as the technology leader for the connected lifestyle, including enterprise, home, car and mobile markets. With the transformative acquisitions of Red Bend and Symphony Teleca and expanded capabilities in cloud, mobility and analytics, HARMAN will accelerate Internet of Things solutions for a broader set of industries and markets.”

Summary of Operations – Gross Margin and SG&A  

Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 155 basis points to 30.2 percent. The improvement was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume utilizing a more efficient fixed production cost base and favorable product mix.  

In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 59 basis points to 20.0 percent on a non-GAAP basis primarily due to improved operating leverage on higher sales.  

2015 Guidance Update  

HARMAN today raised its financial outlook for fiscal 2015. The Company now forecasts operational EBITDA and operational earnings per share of $715 million and $5.85, respectively, based on: a Euro/USD weighted average rate of 1.22 (1.15 for the second half of fiscal year 2015); an effective tax rate of 24 percent for the full year; and approximately 70.5 million shares outstanding for the full year.

Net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 were $774 million, an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period in the prior year or 18 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The increases in net sales were due to the expansion of recently launched platforms, stronger automotive production and higher take rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation.  

On a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, gross margin increased 137 basis points to 25.5 percent compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of improved leverage on fixed production costs and benefits from footprint migration restructuring initiatives. SG&A spending decreased 181 basis points to 13.4 percent primarily due to improved operating leverage on higher sales.  

Infotainment Division Highlights  

During the quarter, HARMAN continued to position itself for long-term growth in the emerging markets. In India, HARMAN secured new business with TATA Motors, and in recognition of its strategic contribution to the recently launched ConnectNext connectivity platform, HARMAN was awarded the TATA Technology Supplier of the Year award. HARMAN also opened its first manufacturing plant in Pune, India to deliver cutting-edge infotainment and audio solutions for regional automakers.  

HARMAN gained new business awards with Guangzhou Automotive Group/Chrysler/FIAT (GAC/FIAT), Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota. In addition, HARMAN announced a strategic collaboration with Baidu, the most popular search engine and mobile map provider in China. HARMAN will seamlessly integrate Baidu’s new CarLife networking solution into HARMAN’s infotainment head units. HARMAN and Baidu will bring a tailored in-vehicle user experience and personalized content to the Chinese market, offering advanced internet capabilities, entertainment features and location-based services, resulting in a richer and more immersive connected car experience.  

At CES 2015, HARMAN introduced several breakthrough technologies. HARMAN unveiled the newest evolution of its scalable infotainment platform. Designed for entry- and mid-level vehicles, the solution offers flexible smartphone connectivity, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto along with on-board navigation options, integrated audio support, and robust cyber security. The Company also launched the industry’s first connected navigation solution based on the Navigation Data Standard (NDS) that incrementally updates map data in the field. This over-the-air (OTA) update capability ensures map data is always up-to-date and is delivered seamlessly to cars on the road. BMW is the first automaker to deploy the solution across the HARMAN-developed NBT infotainment platform. 

During the quarter, HARMAN announced it plans to acquire Stuttgart-based S1nn GmbH, an innovative developer of infotainment systems, connectivity, and car audio solutions with strong HTML5 based capabilities. S1nn customers include Volkswagen, Porsche, Audi and Tesla Motors.  

Lifestyle Division

Net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 were $541 million, an increase of 26 percent compared to the same period in the prior year, or 31 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The growth in home and multimedia was primarily due to recent product introductions and the continued expansion of global distribution channels. The growth in car audio was primarily driven by higher take rates, stronger automotive production and expansion of recently launched programs.  

On a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, gross margin improved by 15 basis points to 31.8 percent compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 29 basis points to 19.1 percent, due to continued investments in marketing.  

Lifestyle Division Highlights  

During the quarter, HARMAN secured new car audio awards from Great Wall Motors, Lexus, and Ferrari. HARMAN also secured an award for hands-free microphones from Porsche. The Company launched new car audio systems in the new Mercedes GLA, and BMW M4 Cabrio and the 2Series Sports Tourer. HARMAN’s Clari-Fi™ audio restoration technology is also an integral feature in new vehicle launches by Hyundai and Lexus.  

HARMAN also introduced new technology that creates independent sound zones within the car. Demonstrated at CES 2015, this new technology combines innovative acoustic design and complementary digital signal processing to create a more comfortable and enjoyable in-cabin experience. Each passenger can activate and control their zone, so for example, phone calls can remain private and music playback can be limited to each passenger’s seat. At CES, HARMAN also demonstrated its HALOsonic suite of noise management solutions, including Engine Order Cancellation (EOC), Engine Sound Synthesis (ESS) and Road Noise Cancellation (RNC). These technologies have received high industry praise, including the prestigious SAE 2014 Environmental Excellence in Transportation award for HALOsonic.  

HARMAN’s home and multimedia products were recognized during the quarter with several industry accolades. The Company received nine CES Innovation awards, and seven products were named “Best Product Sound of CES” and “Best Wireless Headphones of CES” by publications such as CNET and Europe’s Computerbild.  

The Harman Kardon Wireless HD audio system was successfully launched in Europe, China and the US, bringing HD audio to end consumers through its multi-room streaming capabilities. Unlike other wireless streaming systems, the Harman Kardon Omni home system supports 24-bit/96kHz studio quality HD audio streaming, offering a superior audio experience with higher resolution than from a CD.  

Building on the emerging interest for high definition audio solutions, HARMAN announced a strategic partnership with Pono Music, led by music icon Neil Young. The two companies are collaborating to bring high definition audio into the car.

Net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 were $267 million, an increase of 29 percent compared to the same period in the prior year, or 32 percent excluding foreign currency impact. The increase in net sales is primarily due to the expansion of the Company’s product portfolio into enterprise automation and video switching, as a result of the acquisition of AMX.  

On a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, gross margin increased 277 basis points to 40.4 percent and SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased to 28 percent compared to 24.6 percent in the prior year. Both of these increases are primarily due to the expansion of the Company’s product portfolio into enterprise automation and video switching.

During the second quarter, the Company’s audio, video, lighting and enterprise automation and control system solutions were selected by leading system integrators and installers around the world. Notable projects include AON headquarters in London, São Paulo Airport, Marine Corp University, the Las Vegas MGM hotel, and Carnival cruise ships.
