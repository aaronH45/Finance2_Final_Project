ONEOK Increases Quarterly Dividend 

TULSA, Okla. – Jan. 14, 2015 – The board of directors of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today increased ONEOK’s quarterly cash dividend by 1.5 cents per share, or 3 percent, to 60.5 cents per share, effective for the fourth quarter 2014, resulting in an annualized cash dividend of $2.42 per share. The dividend is payable Feb. 13, 2015, to shareholders of record at the close of business Jan. 30, 2015. 

“As the pure-play general partner of ONEOK Partners, we are committed to delivering sustainable, long-term value to our shareholders," said Terry K. Spencer, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK. “Since 2006, the partnership has completed more than $8 billion in capital-growth projects and acquisitions, and it has another $3 billion in capital-growth projects in various stages of construction. Even in this volatile commodity pricing environment, ONEOK remains well positioned to benefit from ONEOK Partners’ increased earnings and distributable cash flow as a result of completed capital-growth projects.” 

This dividend increase is ONEOK’s fourth since becoming the pure-play general partner of ONEOK Partners in February 2014 and represents a 51 percent increase during that period.
