On February 13, 2015, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (the “Company”) completed the issuance and sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”). The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated February 11, 2014 between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (the “Trustee”) (the “Base Indenture”), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 13, 2015, between the Company and the Trustee (the “Second Supplemental Indenture,” and together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”). The Notes were issued through an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) among the Company and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto, dated February 10, 2015. 

The Notes, which are unsecured obligations of the Company, will mature in 2025 and will bear interest at the rate of 3.500% per year, with interest payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2015. The Company may redeem the Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition to customary event of default provisions, the Indenture limits the Company’s ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. 

The Notes were registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-190402). The Company is filing the Underwriting Agreement, the Second Supplemental Indenture and the opinion of Ropes & Gray LLP relating to the validity of the Notes as exhibits to this filing.
