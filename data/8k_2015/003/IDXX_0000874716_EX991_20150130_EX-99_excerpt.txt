IDEXX Laboratories Announces Fourth Quarter Results 

-- Achieves full-year normalized organic revenue growth of 10%, driven by 11% normalized organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue 

-- Adjusted EPS of $3.99 per share includes benefits from lower effective tax rate 

-- 2015 outlook raised to 13.5%-14.5% normalized organic revenue growth 

-- 2015 EPS guidance updated to $4.33-$4.43, as benefits from stronger organic revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate mitigate significant impacts of recently strengthened US dollar 

WESTBROOK, Maine, Jan. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ: IDXX) today reported revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 of $352 million. Continued strong normalized organic revenue growth1,2 was offset in the quarter by a one-time $25 million reduction in US channel inventory related to the Company's transition to a fully-direct CAG Diagnostics sales strategy in the US and foreign exchange impacts from a stronger US dollar, resulting in a 1% reported revenue decline. Adjusting for one-time channel inventory reductions, the effect of foreign exchange rate changes, and revenue attributable to acquisitions, normalized organic revenue growth for the quarter was 9%, and 10% for the full year, supported by 11.5% normalized organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in Q4 and 11.4% for the full year.

Earnings per diluted share ("EPS") was $0.54 for the fourth quarter and $3.58 for the year. Reported EPS includes impacts related to the transition to the all-direct CAG Diagnostics sales approach in the US of $0.41 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.45 for the full year 2014, consistent with expectations. Adjusted EPS3, which excludes these impacts, was $3.99 for the full year including a $0.065 per share benefit from the 2014 extension of the federal research and development ("R&D") tax credit. Adjusted EPS grew 15% for the year despite a negative 3% growth impact related to changes in net foreign exchange rates.

"We are very pleased with the market and financial performance we achieved in the quarter, in particular the record levels of premium instrument placements that we reported earlier in the month and the continued strength in our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue in both the US and international operations. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue grew in total over 11% on a normalized organic basis," said Jonathan Ayers, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "These results cap a year where we successfully accelerated our normalized organic revenue growth 3 points to 10%, while completing the transformation of our US Companion Animal Group to a fully-direct model."

"Our continued innovation includes the announcement of our new reference lab SDMA test for chronic kidney disease, as well as an advanced reference lab fecal panel for intestinal parasites. These introductions, along with Catalyst One™ and SNAP Pro™, will combine with a stronger presence with customers resulting from our US all-direct sales strategy and continued development of our international operations to drive continued advancement in the standard of care practiced by veterinary practices globally and our Company's profitable organic revenue growth. These significant accomplishments give us confidence that the enduring growth annuity of our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, which makes up over 70% of the Company's total annual revenue, will continue to exhibit strong growth in 2015 and years beyond. Reflecting our strong momentum, we are raising our guidance for 2015 normalized organic revenue growth to 13.5% to 14.5%," added Ayers.

Fourth Quarter Financial Performance Highlights

Fourth quarter revenue was $352 million, net of $25 million of impact related to reductions in US channel inventories. This one-time impact and foreign exchange rate changes which lowered reported revenue growth by 3%, resulted in a 1% reduction in reported revenues. 

Underlying operating trends remained strong, reflected in fourth quarter normalized organic revenue growth of 9%. These results were supported by continued solid normalized organic revenue growth across regions and business segments.  Companion Animal Group ("CAG") normalized organic revenue growth was 9% for the fourth quarter. Normalized CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth of 11.5% benefited less than 1% from incremental margin on sales through our US direct sales channel and was driven by 15% gains in IDEXX VetLab® consumables and 13% growth in reference lab and consulting services.  Catalyst placements increased 19% and premium hematology instrument placements 23% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period. Instrument revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014 declined 9% organically, reflecting the lower price point for Catalyst One, greater instrument placements with a deferred revenue component including placements associated with the Catalyst One introductory offer, and lower average prices for certain instruments internationally.  Livestock, Poultry and Dairy ("LPD") organic revenue growth2 was 10% for the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of strong worldwide bovine product volume.  Water's organic revenue growth was also 10% in the fourth quarter, supported by worldwide customer acquisitions.

Gross margins for the fourth quarter decreased to 51.8% from 53.3% in the prior-year period, primarily due to transitional expenses associated with expanding US distribution and the impact of US channel inventory reductions on product mix, both associated with the transition to the US all-direct sales model. Adjusting for these impacts, comparable gross margins increased moderately benefitting from lower product costs and modest net price increases.

Operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased 16%, or 8% excluding $10 million of expenses associated with the transition to an all-direct sales strategy for US CAG Diagnostics, reflecting planned increases in global commercial resources. 

Operating margin decreased from 17.3% in the prior-year period to 9.9% for the fourth quarter. This reduction entirely reflects the transitional impacts related to the all-direct CAG Diagnostics sales strategy implementation in the US. The following table adjusts fourth quarter and full-year operating margin results to normalize for these effects:

Financial Outlook for 2015

The Company is updating its financial guidance, in part to reflect the significant strengthening of the US dollar relative to foreign currencies. At current foreign exchange rates, we estimate that the effect of the stronger US dollar will adversely impact 2015 reported revenue growth by approximately 5% and EPS by an estimated $0.22 per share compared to rates in effect in 2014. Compared to assumptions used in our prior guidance for 2015 provided during our third quarter earnings call on October 24, 2014, the continued strengthening of the US dollar has the effect of lowering projected revenue by approximately $55 million and EPS by $0.13 per share. These effects are mitigated by the Company's raised expectation for normalized organic revenue growth and assumptions for a 30% effective tax rate, resulting in a net $0.05 per share reduction in our 2015 EPS guidance range compared to our prior guidance provided in October of 2014. 

The Company provides the following updated guidance for 2015:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The guidance above reflects the assumptions that the value of the US dollar relative to other currencies will remain at our current assumptions of the euro at $1.12, the British pound at $1.50, the Canadian dollar at $0.80, the Australian dollar at $0.81 and the Japanese yen at ¥120 to the US dollar for the full year of 2015.

The favorable deferred revenue impact of our Catalyst One introductory offer is expected to increase revenue growth for the full year 2015 by approximately 0.5%. Changes in net foreign exchange rates are projected to reduce Adjusted EPS growth by 6% in 2015.

We expect an effective tax rate of 30%. This outlook has not assumed that the federal R&D tax credit, which benefited EPS by $0.065 per share in 2014, will be renewed in 2015. The comparison of 2015 guidance excluding the federal R&D tax credit, to 2014 results including this tax credit, reduces projected Adjusted EPS growth by 2%.

We are projecting a reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 6.5% to 7.0%, and interest expense, net of interest income, of approximately $27 to $28 million reflecting current and projected borrowings.

1 All references to growth and organic growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2013. 

2 Normalized organic revenue growth and organic revenue growth are non-GAAP financial measures Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers. Organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2014 excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a 3% unfavorable impact on revenue growth, and revenue from business acquisitions, which contributed 0.5% to revenue growth. Organic revenue growth for the full year of 2014 excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a 0.7% unfavorable impact on revenue growth, and revenue from business acquisitions, which contributed 0.6% to revenue growth. See the supplementary analysis of results below for a reconciliation of reported revenue growth to organic revenue growth for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Management also believes that reporting normalized organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue growth performance with prior and future periods. Our rapid assay products and VetLab instrument consumables are currently sold by third party distributors, who purchase products from us and sell them to end users, such as veterinary practices. As a result, distributor inventory levels have an impact on our reported sales, and distributor inventory levels may be affected by many factors, which may not be directly related to underlying end-user demand for our products. Notably, the estimated impact of a one-time reduction in projected revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 associated with the drawdown of inventory held by distributors related to our transition to an all-direct CAG Diagnostics sales strategy in the US (heretofore referred to as the all-direct transition) has been added back to 2014 estimated reported revenue to calculate estimated 2015 normalized organic revenue growth. Normalized organic revenue growth excludes the impact of changes in our significant distributors' inventory levels on organic revenue growth for the relevant period. We are unable to obtain data for sales to end users from certain less significant third party distributors internationally. We do not believe the impact of changes in these international distributors' inventories would have a material impact on our growth rates. Reconciliation of organic revenue growth to normalized organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2014 includes the following negative impacts to organic revenue growth from changes in our significant distributors' inventory levels; Total Company 7.3%, US 12.2%, International 0.5%, CAG Diagnostics Recurring 10.8%; VetLab consumables 18.2%, and Rapid Assay 28.5%. Reconciliation of organic revenue growth to normalized organic revenue growth for the full year of 2014 includes the following negative impacts to organic revenue growth from changes in our significant distributors' inventory levels; Total Company 2.0%, US 3.2%, International 0.3%, CAG Diagnostics Recurring 2.8%; VetLab consumables 4.6%, and Rapid Assay 7.4%.

3 Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS growth are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that reporting Adjusted EPS provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our EPS performance with prior and future periods. For the fourth quarter 2014 comparison to the prior-year period, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS growth exclude impacts related to the all-direct transition. For the total year 2014 comparison to the prior year, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS growth exclude impacts in the second half of 2014 related to the all-direct transition, a non-recurring income tax benefit related to the deferral of intercompany profits recorded in the third quarter of 2014, a charge resulting from a third-party service provider bankruptcy in 2013, and the full year impact of the federal R&D tax credit associated with the 2012 tax year that was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. For the total year projected 2015 comparison to 2014, 2014 excludes impacts in the second half of 2014 related to the all-direct transition and a non-recurring income tax benefit related to the deferral of intercompany profits recorded in the third quarter of 2014. See the supplementary analysis of results in financial tables for a reconciliation of EPS to Adjusted EPS for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014. 

4 Operating margin (normalized) is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that reporting operating margin after normalizing for all-direct transition impacts provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our operating margin performance with prior and future periods.

5 Normalized organic revenue growth excluding margin capture is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that reporting normalized organic revenue growth excluding margin capture provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our normalized organic revenue growth performance with prior and future periods. Normalized organic revenue growth excluding margin capture is normalized organic revenue growth as described in the footnote 2 above, adjusted to exclude the impact of margin gained in 2014 and 2015 from selling our products directly to our US based customers as opposed to through third party distributors. 

6 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and means, with respect to a measurement period, the cash generated from operations during that period, excluding tax benefits attributable to share-based compensation arrangements, reduced by the Company's investments in fixed assets. Management believes free cash flow is a useful measure because it indicates the cash the operations of the business are generating after appropriate reinvestment for recurring investments in fixed assets that are required to operate the business. See the supplementary analysis of results below for our calculation of free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. With respect to this particular forward-looking projected non-GAAP financial measure, the Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation as the inputs to the measurement are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events.

1 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated from cash generated from operations, excluding tax benefits attributable to share-based compensation arrangements, reduced by the Company's investments in fixed assets. Management believes free cash flow is a useful measure because it indicates the cash the operations of the business are generating after appropriate reinvestment for recurring investments in fixed assets that are required to operate the business. Management also believes this is a common financial measure useful to further evaluate the results of operations.
