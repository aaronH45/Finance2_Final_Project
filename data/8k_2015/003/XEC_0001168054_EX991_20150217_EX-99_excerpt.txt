DENVER, Feb. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE: XEC) today reported fourth quarter 2014 net income of $75.8 million, or $0.86 per diluted share. Adjusted fourth quarter net income was $76.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, compared to fourth-quarter 2013 adjusted net income of $117.6 million, or $1.35 per diluted share(1). For the year, net income totaled $507.2 million, or $5.78 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the full year was $5.76 per share(1). Adjusted cash flow from operations grew 18 percent in 2014 to $1.63 billion(1). Strong growth in production resulted in record revenues of $2.4 billion in 2014, up 21 percent from 2013. 

Total company production volumes reached a record 949.5 million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) per day in the fourth quarter, up 35 percent from a year ago. Despite weather and pipeline disruptions that impacted Permian operations early in the quarter, Permian oil production increased 12 percent sequentially and averaged 38,246 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. For the full year, daily production volumes averaged a record 869 MMcfe per day, up 25 percent over 2013 average daily output of 693 MMcfe per day. 

In 2014 Cimarex invested $2.2 billion including exploration and development expenditures of $1.9 billion and property acquisitions of $250 million. These investments were largely funded with cash flow and the proceeds from property sales.

Proved reserves at December 31, 2014 were 3.1 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), up 25 percent year over year. Reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled 814 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) and when combined with upward revisions of 105 Bcfe, replaced 290 percent of production. Proved reserves are 77 percent proved developed. (See table of Proved Reserves below.)

Sharp declines in oil prices impacted the company's financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year. Realized oil prices averaged $64.94 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $83.70 for the full year, down 30 and 10 percent versus the respective periods a year ago. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices averaged $3.95 per Mcf and NGL prices averaged $25.32 per barrel compared to $3.85 and $31.68, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2013. (See table of Price and Production Data below.)

Total debt at December 31, 2014, consisted of $1.5 billion of long-term notes. Cimarex had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility and had a cash balance of $406 million. Debt was 25 percent of total capitalization(2).

Permian Basin 

Production from the Permian Basin averaged 446.4 MMcfe per day in the fourth quarter, a 34 percent increase over fourth-quarter 2013 and 9 percent sequentially. Quarterly oil volumes increased 29 percent year-over-year to 38,246 barrels per day and accounted for 51 percent of the region's total production for the quarter. 

Cimarex drilled and completed 54 gross (39 net) Permian Basin wells during the fourth quarter, bringing the total for 2014 to 171 gross (117 net) wells. 

Cimarex participated in the drilling and completion of 48 gross (27 net) New Mexico Bone Spring wells during 2014. Average 30-day gross peak production from the Cimarex-operated wells was 930 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day (79 percent oil). Ward County, Texas Third Bone Spring drilling totaled 13 gross (seven net) wells with average 30-day gross peak production rates of approximately 937 BOE per day (79 percent oil) from Cimarex-operated wells. Culberson County Bone Spring wells totaled 16 gross (nine net) with average 30-day gross peak production rates of approximately 1,065 BOE per day (64 percent oil) from Cimarex-operated wells. Cimarex also drilled and completed 14 gross (14 net) horizontal Avalon shale wells in 2014. The Cimarex-operated Avalon wells had an average 30-day gross production rate per well of approximately 797 BOE per day (67 percent oil). 

Of note, Cimarex recently completed several long lateral Wolfcamp wells in the Delaware Basin, including five 10,000-foot Wolfcamp D wells in Culberson County, Texas. These wells had an average 30-day gross peak production rate of 2,236 BOE per day (26 percent oil, 45 percent gas, 29 percent NGL). Cimarex also completed its first Wolfcamp A long lateral in Culberson County. The Gato de Sol 34 Unit #1H was completed on a 7,500-foot lateral with a 30-stage completion and had an average 30-day peak production rate 1,491 BOE per day (50 percent oil, 30 percent gas, 20 percent NGL).

Mid-Continent 

The majority of Mid-Continent activity was in the Cana-Woodford shale play in western Oklahoma, where Cimarex drilled and completed 94 gross (42 net) wells in 2014. Fourth-quarter 2014 net production from Cana-Woodford averaged 384.3 MMcfe per day and was 40 percent of Cimarex's total company production. Total Mid-Continent production averaged 488.0 MMcfe per day for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 451.2 MMcfe per day for the full year. At year-end, 15 gross (5 net) wells were awaiting completion, including 10 gross (4 net) Cana-Woodford wells.

Cimarex also tested a new zone in the Mid-Continent in 2014. Called the Meramec, it sits above the Woodford Shale and is up to 550 feet thick. Cimarex drilled seven wells in 2014 over a broad swath of its acreage. All the Meramec wells were drilled using 5,000-foot laterals and 20 stage completions. The first six wells had an average 30-day peak production rate of 10.2 MMcfe per day. Oil comprised between 20-55 percent of the total production stream. Natural gas averaged 44 percent and NGL averaged 39 percent. The seventh well is currently flowing back. Cimarex has approximately 115,000 net acres that are prospective for the Meramec.

Denver-based Cimarex Energy Co. is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with principal operations in the Mid-Continent and Permian Basin areas of the U.S. 

This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding projected results and future events. Please refer to the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, to be filed with the SEC, for a list of certain risk factors that may affect these forward-looking statements.

Actual results may differ materially from company projections and other forward-looking statements and can be affected by a variety of factors outside the control of the company including, among other things: oil, NGL and natural gas price volatility; the ability to complete property sales or other transactions; the ability to receive drilling and other permits and rights-of-way in a timely manner; development drilling and testing results; the potential for production decline rates to be greater than expected; performance of acquired properties and newly drilled wells; costs and availability of third party facilities for gathering, processing, refining and transportation; regulatory approvals, including regulatory restrictions on federal lands; legislative or regulatory changes, including initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing; higher than expected costs and expenses, including the availability and cost of services and materials; unexpected future capital expenditures; economic and competitive conditions; the ability to obtain industry partners to jointly explore certain prospects, and the willingness and ability of those partners to meet capital obligations when requested; declines in the values of our oil and gas properties resulting in impairments; changes in estimates of proved reserves; compliance with environmental and other regulations; derivative and hedging activities; risks associated with operating in one major geographic area; the success of the company's risk management activities; title to properties; litigation; environmental liabilities; and other factors discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC. Cimarex Energy Co. encourages readers to consider the risks and uncertainties associated with projections and other forward-looking statements. In addition, the company assumes no obligation to publicly revise or update any forward-looking statements based on future events or circumstances.

(1)Adjusted net income and adjusted cash flow from operations are non-GAAP financial measures. See below for a reconciliation of the related amounts.

(2)Reconciliation of debt to total capitalization, which is a non-GAAP measure, is: long-term debt of $1.5 billion divided by long-term debt of $1.5 billion plus stockholders' equity of $4.5 billion.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the noted item because management believes this item affects the comparability of operating results. The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP earnings because:

 a) Management uses adjusted net income to evaluate the company's operational trends and performance relative to other oil and gas exploration and production companies.

 b) Adjusted net income is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by research analysts.

* Earnings per share are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of adjusted cash flow from operations is useful information for investors because it is used internally and is accepted by the investment community as a means of measuring the company's ability to fund its capital program, without fluctuations caused by changes in current assets and liabilities, which are included in the GAAP measure of cash flow from operating activities. It is also used by professional research analysts in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.

** Pre-tax PV-10% is a non-GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10% is comparable to the standardized measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10% is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure but without deducting future income taxes. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, Cimarex's discounted future income taxes were $2,036.6 million and $1,601.7 million, respectively. Cimarex's standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $4,352.8 million at year-end 2014 and $3,598.9 million at year-end 2013. Cimarex believes pre-tax PV-10% is a useful measure for investors for evaluating the relative monetary significance of its oil and natural gas properties. Cimarex further believes investors may utilize its pre-tax PV-10% as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of its reserves to other companies because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid. However, pre-tax PV-10% is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Cimarex's pre-tax PV-10% and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of its oil and natural gas reserves.
