The Southern Company (“Southern Company”) and Mississippi Power Company (“Mississippi Power”) are furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide investors with information regarding Mississippi Power’s updated cost estimate for completion and start-up of the integrated coal gasification combined cycle project in Kemper County, Mississippi (the “Kemper IGCC”) and the related recognition of charges to income. The information in Items 2.02 and 7.01 in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section.

The information set forth below in Item 7.01 related to the updated cost estimate for completing the Kemper IGCC and the related recognition of charges to income is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02.

Item 7.01.Regulation FD Disclosure.

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” of Southern Company, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” and - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” of Mississippi Power, and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” and of Mississippi Power under “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” in Item 8 of each company’s Annual

Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 (the “Form 10-K”). See also MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” of Southern Company and Mississippi Power, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” of Mississippi Power, and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” in each company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 for additional information regarding the construction of the Kemper IGCC, including the cost cap set by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (the “Mississippi PSC”) of $2.88 billion, net of $245 million of grants awarded to the project by the U.S. Department of Energy under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2 (the “DOE Grants”) and excluding the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the carbon dioxide pipeline facilities, allowance for funds used during construction related to the Kemper IGCC, and certain general exceptions, including change of law, force majeure, and beneficial capital (which exists when Mississippi Power demonstrates that the purpose and effect of the construction cost increase is to produce efficiencies that will result in a neutral or favorable effect on customers relative to the original proposal for the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity) (the “Cost Cap Exceptions”).

In its Kemper County Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle Project Monthly Status Report through November 2014 (the “November PSC Report”), Mississippi Power reported additional estimated costs subject to the cost cap in the amount of approximately $25 million related to the completion of construction of the Kemper IGCC, which included construction support costs during start-up and commissioning. The November PSC Report also disclosed Mississippi Power’s ongoing review of potential additional costs of $20 

3

million to $50 million, which would be completed in connection with its next monthly status report.

Following this review, on February 3, 2015, Mississippi Power further revised its cost estimate subject to the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC to include an additional adjustment of approximately $45 million related to operational readiness, start-up activities and fuel, and the completion of construction of the Kemper IGCC, including construction support costs during start-up and commissioning. The total estimated Kemper IGCC cost subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $4.93 billion, net of the DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. 

Mississippi Power does not intend to seek any rate recovery or joint owner contributions for any costs related to the construction of the Kemper IGCC that exceed the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. As a result of the revised cost estimate, Southern Company and Mississippi Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable losses on the Kemper IGCC of approximately $70 million ($43 million after-tax) during the fourth quarter 2014, which are in addition to previous charges totaling $1.98 billion ($1.22 billion after-tax) recognized in prior years and through September 30, 2014.

Any future cost increases and/or extensions of the in-service date with respect to the Kemper IGCC may result from factors including, but not limited to, labor costs and productivity, adverse weather conditions, shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor, contractor or supplier delay, non-performance under construction or other agreements, operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs, unforeseen engineering or design problems, start-up activities for this first-of-a-kind technology (including major equipment failure and system integration), and/or 

4

operational performance (including additional costs to satisfy any operational parameters ultimately adopted by the Mississippi PSC). In subsequent periods, any further changes in the estimated costs to complete construction and start-up of the Kemper IGCC subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions, will be reflected in Southern Company’s and Mississippi Power’s statements of income and these changes could be material.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 

In addition, on February 3, 2015, Mississippi Power submitted its Kemper County Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle Project Monthly Status Report through December 2014 (the “December PSC Report”) to the Mississippi PSC pursuant to Docket No. 2009-UA-14. A copy of the December PSC Report is furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
