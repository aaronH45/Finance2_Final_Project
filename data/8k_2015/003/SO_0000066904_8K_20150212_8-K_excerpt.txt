The Southern Company (“Southern Company”) and Mississippi Power Company (“Mississippi Power”) are filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide investors with information regarding Mississippi Power’s integrated coal gasification combined cycle project in Kemper County, Mississippi (the “Kemper IGCC”), the legal challenge to the Mississippi Public Service Commission’s (the “Mississippi PSC”) rate order approving retail rate increases of 15% effective March 19, 2013, and 3% effective January 1, 2014 (the “2013 MPSC Rate Order”), and the related January 2013 settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC that established processes for resolving matters regarding cost recovery related to the Kemper IGCC (the “2013 Settlement Agreement”). 

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

The information set forth below in Item 8.01 is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02.

Item 8.01. Other Events.

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” in Mississippi Power’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 (the “Form 10-K”). See also Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and of Mississippi Power under “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” in Item 8 of each company’s Form 10-K. In addition, see MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” in Mississippi Power’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 (the “Form 10-Q”). See also Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under

“Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” in each company’s Form 10-Q for additional information.

On February 12, 2015, the Supreme Court of Mississippi (the “Court”) issued a decision in the legal challenge to the 2013 MPSC Rate Order filed by Thomas A. Blanton. The Court reversed the 2013 MPSC Rate Order. The Court also found the 2013 Settlement Agreement unenforceable due to a lack of public notice for the related proceedings. The Court’s ruling remands the matter to the Mississippi PSC to (1) fix by order the rates that were in existence prior to the 2013 MPSC Rate Order, (2) fix no rate increases until the Mississippi PSC is in compliance with the Court’s ruling, and (3) enter an order refunding the monies attributable to the rate increases under the 2013 MPSC Rate Order. The Court concluded, in part, that the Mississippi PSC should have determined the prudency of Kemper IGCC costs before approving rate recovery through the 2013 MPSC Rate Order. Through December 31, 2014, Mississippi Power had collected approximately $257 million through rates under the 2013 MPSC Rate Order, of which approximately $32 million ($20 million after-tax) has been recognized in income. Any required refunds would also include carrying costs. The Court’s order does not have any impact on the Mississippi PSC’s 2012 order confirming the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Kemper IGCC.

Mississippi Power continues to analyze the Court’s opinion and expects to file for rehearing. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
