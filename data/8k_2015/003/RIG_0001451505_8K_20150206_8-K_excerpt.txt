On February 6, 2015, Transocean Ltd. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the schedule for the payment of the fourth installment of its U.S. dollar-denominated dividend. The installment of $0.75 per share, or approximately $272 million, is based upon the number of currently outstanding shares.

The Company will pay the fourth installment of $0.75 in accordance with the following schedule:

• February 18, 2015 - Ex-dividend date

• February 20, 2015 - Record date

• March 18, 2015 - Installment payment date

Shareholders who wish to receive the payment in Swiss Francs (“CHF”) must make their election between 5 p.m. EST (11 p.m. CET) on February 23, 2015 and 8 p.m. EST on February 27, 2015 (2 a.m. CET February 28, 2015). On or about March 16, 2015, the dividend payment will be converted into CHF by Computershare and the equivalent CHF per share will be posted to the company’s website at www.deepwater.com.
