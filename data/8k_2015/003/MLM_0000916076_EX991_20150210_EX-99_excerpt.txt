MARTIN MARIETTA REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS  

Quarterly Earnings Per Diluted Share of $0.94  

Fourth-Quarter Heritage Consolidated Gross Margin Expands 370 Basis Points  

Accelerated TXI-Related Synergy Realization Delivers 2014 Accretion  

New Share Repurchase Program Announced  

Aggregates Product Line Volume Up 19% and Pricing Up 7%  

Magnesia Specialties Generates Record Fourth-Quarter Net Sales  

RALEIGH, North Carolina (February 10, 2015) – Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) today reported its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2014.  

Ward Nye, Chairman, President and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated: “2014 was a transformational year for Martin Marietta, and we are proud of the results we delivered, including a 77% increase in fourth-quarter net earnings over the prior-year quarter. Further, TXI-related synergy realization accelerated in the fourth quarter, making the transaction accretive for the year. These results further validate the successful execution of our strategic initiatives and the benefit of continuous focus on our core principles, including operational excellence and cost discipline. Our strong foundation, bolstered by the acquisition of Texas Industries, Inc. (“TXI”) in July, has us well positioned to continue delivering increased shareholder value as we serve the rising demand for building materials.  

“Employment growth in the United States, a stimulus for construction activity, is at its highest rate since 2006. Texas leads the nation in job growth, with widespread gains across many industry sectors, including trade, professional business services, leisure and hospitality, education and health services. Additionally, the Texas Department of Transportation is operating with a robust budget and project backlog. Further, voters in Texas recently approved Proposition 1, a constitutional amendment authorizing annual disbursements from the state’s existing oil and gas production tax collections to the State Highway Fund, including an additional $1.7 billion in 2015. We believe growth in Texas is sustainable, supported by a favorable business climate, diversity of economic drivers, state construction activity and recent commitments to major, multiyear projects, notwithstanding the moderation in the oil and gas industry. Our enhanced position in Texas has created a platform to capitalize on these opportunities.  

“The Aggregates business’ gross profit increased $34 million over the prior-year quarter, demonstrating the powerful combination of volume and pricing growth from the heritage business and the contribution from the acquired TXI operations. Notably, we achieved this improvement in gross profit despite recovery in the eastern United States lagging the western half of the country. However, momentum is increasing in the Southeast, where North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all rank in the top five states in the nation for employment growth.”  

Mr. Nye continued, “We continue to focus on maximizing the synergistic value of the TXI transaction. To that end, we now expect to achieve annual synergies of $100 million by the end of 2016, an increase of more than 40% compared with our previously announced target. Our 2015 plan assumes achievement of our targeted general and administrative synergies. As we continue the integration process, we remain committed to achieving world-class safety standards and increasing shareholder value.”

QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS (ALL COMPARISONS ARE VERSUS THE PRIOR-YEAR FOURTH QUARTER UNLESS NOTED OTHERWISE)  

Aggregates Business  

Heritage aggregates product line shipments reflect growth in all end-use markets. Shipments to the infrastructure market comprised 44% of quarterly volumes and increased 12%, with each reportable group achieving double-digit improvement. The growth reflects projects funded by the Transportation Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act, or TIFIA, and public-private partnerships, which are having a positive impact in Texas, Colorado and Florida. Federal funding under the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century, or MAP-21, have been extended through May 31, 2015.  

The nonresidential market represented 32% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line shipments and increased 4%. Energy-related shipments remain strong as momentum and the backlog of committed projects, notably in south Texas, have offset any impact from declining oil prices. The Company believes this trend will continue, driven by $100 billion of anticipated energy projects along the Gulf Coast, including a significant portion in Texas, as well as anticipated Proposition 1-funded infrastructure repairs in South Texas. The residential end-use market accounted for 15% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line shipments, and volumes to this market increased 5%. The overall rate of residential growth has slowed, in part due to a reduction in available lot inventory in the Company’s markets. However, the West Group continues to experience significant growth. The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 9% of heritage aggregates product line volumes and increased 5%, reflecting growth in ballast partially offset by a reduction in agricultural lime shipments, principally in the West Group and Mid-America Group, respectively.  

Geographically, heritage aggregates product line shipments increased in each reportable group, led by an adjusted 15.5% increase in the West Group. The West Group’s prior-year quarter included shipments from an Oklahoma quarry and two Dallas, Texas rail yards divested in the third quarter of 2014 as required by the Department of Justice in the TXI acquisition. This divestiture did not meet the accounting requirements for classification as discontinued operations. Reported West Group shipments increased 8.6% in the fourth quarter. Aggregates product line shipments in the Mid-America Group increased 7.7%, led by North Carolina. The Southeast Group reported a volume increase of 4.1%. In addition to the metro-Atlanta area, Florida is also showing signs of further recovery, as the I-4 Ultimate project is under way and the housing market is improving. Recovery in the southeastern United States is also being aided by lower oil prices, which is leading to increased discretionary consumer spending.  

Heritage aggregates product line pricing remains strong and increased in each reportable group, led by a 9.3% improvement in the West Group. The Mid-America Group and Southeast Group achieved pricing increases of 3.9% and 7.2%, respectively.  

The acquired aggregates product line operations continue to be integrated into the heritage business as part of capturing the synergies of the TXI acquisition. While not reflecting the full contribution of these operations, acquired aggregates product line locations reported $31 million of net sales and $3 million of gross profit.  

The heritage ready mixed concrete product line reported pricing and volume improvements of 11% and 2%, respectively, leading to an 840-basis-point improvement in the heritage product line’s gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues). The acquired ready mix concrete operations contributed $107 million of net sales and $4 million of gross profit. The hot mixed asphalt product line reported a 16% increase in net sales.  

Consistent with the Company’s expectations, total production cost per ton for the heritage aggregates product line declined 2%, reflecting increased leverage and lower energy costs.  

Incremental margin for the heritage aggregates business approached targeted objectives, despite the southeastern United States businesses producing at less than 60% of the prior cyclical peak. The heritage Aggregates business gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) was 21.7%, an increase of 370 basis points.  

Magnesia Specialties Business  

Magnesia Specialties continued to deliver strong performance and generated fourth-quarter record net sales of $58.2 million. Fourth-quarter earnings from operations were $19.8 million compared with $20.4 million in the prior-year quarter.

Cement Business  

The Cement business is benefitting from continued strength in the Texas markets, where current demand exceeds local supply, and the Portland Cement Association (PCA) forecasts continued supply/demand imbalance over the next several years. Effective October 1, 2014, the Company announced a price increase of $10 per ton of cement in the Texas and California markets. The Cement group leadership, in collaboration with the Company’s aggregates and ready mixed management, developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies, as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency, providing a road map for significantly improved profitability for 2015 and beyond. During the quarter, the Company incurred $9.6 million in planned cement kiln maintenance costs.  

Synergistic Value of TXI Acquisition  

The Company is working towards its target operating model and integration is progressing. Notably, the Company now expects to achieve $100 million in annual synergies by the end of 2016, resulting from the TXI acquisition. For the second half of 2014, the Company achieved synergies of $27 million, 50% higher than original expectations. In addition, the Company continues to expect to fully utilize TXI’s more than $500 million in existing net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards as well as realize incremental value from the expected divestiture of identified non-operating real estate assets, both over the next few years.  

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS  

For the quarter, acquired TXI operations for all product lines contributed $238 million of net sales, $34 million of gross profit and $51 million of EBITDA.  

Consolidated SG&A was 6.4% of net sales compared with 7.6% in the prior-year quarter. The reduction of 120 basis points reflects the growth of net sales outpacing the increase in SG&A as well as lower pension expense. The Company incurred acquisition-related expenses of $1.7 million, which is the expected run rate for the next few quarters. The Company also recognized $4.9 million of other operating income, which includes gains on sales of assets. Earnings from operations for the quarter were $118.6 million compared with $62.8 million, an increase of 89%.  

The Company’s effective income tax rate for full-year 2014 was 38%, which is higher than the Company’s historical rate. The estimated effective income tax rate, excluding the TXI transaction effects, would have been 30%. The rate increase reflects the tax impact of the TXI transaction, including the limited deductibility of certain acquisition-related expenses and the non-deductibility of goodwill written off as part of the required divestiture. These factors were partially offset by the income tax benefits, resulting from the exercise of converted stock awards issued to former TXI personnel. Cash taxes for the full year were $16 million, which reflects consideration of deferred income taxes and the utilization of an estimated $48 million of NOL carryforwards.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Cash provided by operating activities for 2014 was $381.7 million compared with $309.0 million in 2013, principally attributable to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, coupled with lower cash taxes and partially offset by cash flow used for working capital, all in relation to the prior year. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities, which excludes the impact from nonrecurring transaction and integration expenses related to the TXI acquisition, for 2014 was $452.0 million.  

At December 31, 2014, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined, for the trailing twelve months was 2.5 times, in compliance with the leverage covenant.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  

The Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may acquire up to 20 million shares of its outstanding common stock. The authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares includes the five million shares authorized under the Company’s previous share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2014, there were 67.3 million shares of Martin Marietta common stock outstanding. Future repurchases are expected to be carried out through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated share purchase transactions, or any combination of such methods. The Company expects to complete the repurchase program over the next three years, though the actual timing of completion will be based on an ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of its common stock and general market conditions. Share repurchases will be executed based on then-current business and market factors so the actual return of capital in any single quarter may vary. The repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued by the Board at any time without prior notice.  

“The 20 million share repurchase program demonstrates the transformational power of Martin Marietta’s business model and our commitment to delivering value to shareholders,” said Mr. Nye. “Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation provides us with the flexibility to repurchase up to 30 percent of Martin Marietta’s outstanding shares while continuing to invest in our business and execute our strategic growth initiatives.”  

FULL-YEAR 2015 OUTLOOK  

The Company is encouraged by positive trends in its business and markets, notably:  

·  

Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors. The Dodge Momentum Index is at its highest level since 2009 and signals continued growth.  

·  

Energy-related economic activity, including follow-on public and private construction activities in our primary markets, is anticipated to remain strong.  

·  

Residential construction is expected to continue to grow, driven by historically low levels of construction activity over the previous several years, employment gains, low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption, higher multi-family rental rates and rising housing prices.  

·  

For the public sector, authorized highway funding from MAP-21 should remain stable compared with 2014. Additionally, state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects, including support from TIFIA, are expected to grow and continue to play an expanded role in public-sector activity.  

Based on these trends and expectations, the Company anticipates the following for full-year 2015:  

·  

Aggregates end-use markets compared to 2014 levels are as follows:  

·  

Infrastructure market to increase mid-single digits.  

·  

Nonresidential market to increase in the high-single digits.  

·  

Residential market to experience a double-digit increase.  

·  

ChemRock/Rail market to remain relatively flat.  

·  

Aggregates product line shipments to increase by 10% to 12% compared with 2014 levels.  

·  

Heritage aggregates shipments to increase 4% to 7%  

·  

Shipments from acquired TXI operations to more than double, reflecting a full year of ownership  

·  

Aggregates product line pricing to increase by 4% to 6% compared with 2014.  

·  

Aggregates product line production cost per ton shipped to decline slightly.  

·  

Aggregates-related downstream product lines to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit.  

·  

Net sales for the Cement segment to be between $475 million and $500 million, generating $120 million to $130 million of gross profit.

February 10, 2015 

·  

Net sales for the Magnesia Specialties segment to be between $240 million and $250 million, generating $85 million to $90 million of gross profit.  

·  

SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales to be less than 6.0%, despite an $18 million increase in heritage pension costs, primarily as a result of a lower discount rate.  

·  

Interest expense to approximate $75 million to $80 million.  

·  

Estimated effective income tax rate to approximate 32%, excluding discrete events.  

·  

Consolidated earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (EBITDA) to range from $825 million to $875 million.  

·  

Capital expenditures to approximate $320 million, including $35 million of synergy-related capital and $80 million for the continued development of the new Medina limestone quarry outside of San Antonio. The Medina quarry is rail connected and will be able to ship aggregates products to South Texas, including Houston.  

Mr. Nye concluded, “We are excited about the stronger and broader foundation we have created for Martin Marietta allowing us to achieve even greater success in the years ahead. The TXI acquisition transformed the Company and has us well positioned to benefit from future growth across our markets. We remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet and increasing our financial flexibility, with the underlying goal of creating additional shareholder value.”  

RISKS TO OUTLOOK  

The 2015 outlook includes management’s assessment of the likelihood of certain risks and uncertainties that will affect performance. The most significant risks to the Company’s performance will be Congress’ actions and timing surrounding federal highway funding and uncertainty over the funding mechanism for the Highway Trust Fund. Further, a decline in consumer confidence may negatively impact investment in construction projects. While both MAP-21 and TIFIA credit assistance are excluded from the U.S. debt ceiling limit, this issue may have a significant impact on the economy and, consequently, construction activity. Other risks and uncertainties related to the Corporation’s future performance include, but are not limited to: both price and volume, and a recurrence of widespread decline in aggregates volume negatively affecting aggregates price; the termination, capping and/or reduction of the federal and/or state gasoline tax(es) or other revenue related to infrastructure construction; a significant change in the funding patterns for traditional federal, state and/or local infrastructure projects; a reduction in defense spending, and the subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases; a decline in nonresidential construction; a decline in energy-related drilling activity resulting from a sustained period of low global oil prices or changes in oil production patterns in response to this decline and certain regulatory or other economic factors; a slowdown in the residential construction recovery, or some combination thereof; a reduction in economic activity in the Company’s Midwest states resulting from reduced funding levels provided by the Agricultural Act of 2014 and a reduction in capital investment by the railroads; an increase in the cost of compliance with governmental laws and regulations; unexpected equipment failures, unscheduled maintenance, industrial accident or other prolonged and/or significant disruption to our cement production facilities; and the possibility that certain expected synergies and operating efficiencies in connection with the TXI acquisition are not realized within the expected time-frames or at all. Further, increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability. If these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past, construction spending could be reduced. Cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations. The Magnesia Specialties business essentially runs at capacity; therefore any unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers introduce volatility to the earnings of this segment.  

The Company’s principal business serves customers in aggregates-related construction markets. This concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds normally posted on public projects, together with lien rights on private projects, help to mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables. The level of aggregates demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the Aggregates business and, therefore, profitability. Production costs in the Aggregates business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly. Diesel fuel and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts. Fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in the Company’s long-haul distribution network. The Cement business is also energy intensive and fluctuations in the price of coal affects costs. The Magnesia Specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization and the absolute price and fluctuations in the cost of natural gas.

Transportation in the Company’s long-haul network, particularly the supply of rail cars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains, affects the Company’s ability to efficiently transport aggregate into certain markets, most notably Texas, Florida and the Gulf Coast. In addition, availability of rail cars and locomotives affects the Company’s ability to move dolomitic lime, a key raw material for magnesia chemicals, to both the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan, and customers. The availability of trucks, drivers and railcars to transport the Company’s product, particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand, is also a risk and pressures the associated costs.  

All of the Company’s businesses are also subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability. The first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather. Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters.  

Risks to the outlook also include shipment declines as a result of economic events beyond the Company’s control. In addition to the impact on nonresidential and residential construction, the Company is exposed to risk in its estimated outlook from credit markets and the availability of and interest cost related to its debt.  

The Company’s future performance is also exposed to risks from tax reform at the federal and state levels.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

(Dollars in millions) 

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales and operating margin as a percentage of net sales represent non-GAAP measures. The Corporation presents these ratios calculated based on net sales, as it is consistent with the basis by which management reviews the Corporation's operating results. Further, management believes it is consistent with the basis by which investors analyze the Corporation's operating results, given that freight and delivery revenues and costs represent pass-through and have no profit markup. Gross margin and operating margin calculated as percentages of total revenues represent the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The following tables present the calculations of gross margin and operating margin for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of the ratios as percentages of total revenues to percentages of net sales:
