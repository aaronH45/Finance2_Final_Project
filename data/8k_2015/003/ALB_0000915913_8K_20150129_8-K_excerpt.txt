Item 8.01 Other Events. 

      (a)   Merger    

In connection with Albemarle Corporation’s (“Albemarle”) previously-described acquisition of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (“Rockwood”), on January 14, 2015, Albemarle Holdings II Corporation, a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle, merged with and into Rockwood Specialties Group, Inc. (“RSGI”), a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle, with RSGI as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, RSGI became a guarantor of Albemarle’s 3.000% Senior Notes due 2019, 4.150% Senior Notes due 2024 and 5.450% Senior Notes due 2044. 

      (b)   Fourth Supplemental Indenture    

On January 29, 2015, Albemarle entered into a Fourth Supplemental Indenture (the “Fourth Supplemental Indenture”), among Albemarle, Rockwood, RSGI, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., (as successor to The Bank of New York, “The Bank of New York Mellon”) as resigning trustee, and U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), as successor trustee. The Fourth Supplemental Indenture supplements and amends the Indenture, dated as of January 20, 2005 (as amended and supplemented, the “Indenture”), which governs Albemarle’s outstanding series of senior notes. The Fourth Supplemental Indenture replaces The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, with U.S. Bank, as the successor trustee, with respect to Albemarle’s outstanding 4.50% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “Albemarle 2020 Notes”) and as Trustee under the Indenture. This change will become effective February 9, 2015. The Fourth Supplemental Indenture also adds Rockwood and RSGI as guarantors of the Albemarle 2020 Notes. A copy of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. 

      (c)   Third Supplemental Indenture    

On January 29, 2015, Albemarle entered into a Third Supplemental Indenture (the “Third Supplemental Indenture”), among Albemarle, RSGI, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”), as trustee. The Third Supplemental Indenture supplements and amends the Indenture, dated as of September 25, 2012, among Rockwood, RSGI and Wells Fargo (as amended and supplemented, the “RSGI Indenture”), which governs RSGI’s outstanding 4.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “RSGI Notes”). The Third Supplemental Indenture amends the reporting requirements of the RSGI Indenture by substituting Albemarle for Rockwood so that, so long as Albemarle is a guarantor of the RSGI Notes and complies with certain SEC requirements, the reports, information and other documents required to be filed and furnished to holders of the RSGI Notes pursuant to the RSGI Indenture may, at the option of RSGI, be filed by and be those of Albemarle rather than, as had been done previously, Rockwood. A copy of the Third Supplemental Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
