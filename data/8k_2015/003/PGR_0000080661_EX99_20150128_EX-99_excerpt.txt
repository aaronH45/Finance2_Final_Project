Combined ratios and % growth are not meaningful (NM) due to the low level of premiums earned by, and the variability of loss costs in, such businesses.

Monthly Commentary

•Pursuant to our accounting calendar for 2014, the fourth quarter has 14 weeks of activity, with December being a 5-week month. Progressive operates on an accounting calendar that typically consists of a 52-week year, with 13-week quarters and a 4-week December. Under this calendar, we periodically recognize an additional week of activity, as is the case for 2014. Consequently, our annual, fourth quarter, and December periods for 2014 each include an additional week, which affects comparisons of those periods to prior years.

•In December, we experienced lower loss ratios in our personal auto and Commercial Lines products, reflecting a decrease in loss frequency across most coverages, in part due to milder winter weather this year.

•On December 16, 2014, we announced that we had agreed to acquire an additional 62% ownership stake in ARX Holding Corp., the parent company of American Strategic Insurance, our current provider of homeowners insurance in our "bundled" auto-homeowners insurance package offered through our Agency channel. On January 20, 2015, we received notice that the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period for this transaction. Additional conditions remain outstanding, including the approval of certain state insurance authorities, but we are still targeting an April 1 closing. The estimated cost of the acquisition is about $875 million.

•On December 19, 2014, the Board of Directors declared an annual variable dividend to be paid on February 13, 2015, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 4, 2015 (ex-dividend date of February 2, 2015). The amount of the annual variable dividend is $0.6862 per common share, or an estimated $404.1 million, and is reflected in our 2014 financial statements. The annual variable dividend was calculated using the following formula, as specified by the Board in its December dividend declaration:

Applying full year 2014 financial results, the annual variable dividend was calculated as follows:

•On January 26, 2015, we issued $400 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due 2045 (the “Senior Notes”). We received proceeds of $394.9 million, after deducting underwriter’s discounts and commissions, and incurred an estimated $0.8 million of additional expenses related to the issuance. If we adjusted our year-end results to give effect to this transaction, our debt-to-total capital ratio would have been 27.0%. In addition, upon issuance of the Senior Notes, we closed a forecasted debt issuance hedge, which was entered into to hedge against a possible rise in interest rates, and will recognize a $12.9 million pretax loss ($8.4 million after tax) as part of other comprehensive income in our January results; the loss will subsequently be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense and amortized over the life of the Senior Notes. 

Events

We plan to release January results on Wednesday, February 18, 2015, before the market opens.

We are currently scheduled to hold a one-hour conference call to address questions on Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 9:00 a.m., eastern time, subsequent to the posting of our 2014 Shareholders’ Report online and the filing of our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. Registration for the teleconference and webcast will be available in February at

These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions, and projections generally; inflation and changes in economic conditions (including changes in interest rates and financial markets); the possible failure of one or more governmental, corporate, or other entities to make scheduled debt payments or satisfy other obligations; the potential or actual downgrading by one or more rating agencies of our securities or governmental, corporate, or other securities we hold; the financial condition of, and other issues relating to the strength of and liquidity available to, issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios and other companies with which we have ongoing business relationships, including reinsurers and other counterparties to certain financial transactions; the accuracy and adequacy of our pricing and loss reserving methodologies; the competitiveness of our pricing and the effectiveness of our initiatives to attract and retain more customers; initiatives by competitors and the effectiveness of our response; our ability to obtain regulatory approval for the introduction of products to new jurisdictions, for requested rate changes and the timing thereof and for any proposed acquisitions; the effectiveness of our brand strategy and advertising campaigns relative to those of competitors; legislative and regulatory developments at the state and federal levels, including, but not limited to, matters relating to vehicle and homeowners insurance, health care reform and tax law changes; the outcome of disputes relating to intellectual property rights; the outcome of litigation or governmental investigations that may be pending or filed against us; weather conditions (including the severity and frequency of storms, hurricanes, floods, snowfalls, hail, and winter conditions); changes in driving patterns, including vehicle usage as influenced by the level of oil and gas prices, among other factors; our ability to accurately recognize and appropriately respond in a timely manner to changes in loss frequency and severity trends; technological advances; acts of war and terrorist activities; our ability to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems (including information technology systems), and business functions, and safeguard personal and sensitive information in our possession; our continued access to and functionality of third-party systems that are critical to our business; court decisions, new theories of insurer liability or interpretations of insurance policy provisions and other trends in litigation; changes in health care and auto and property repair costs; and other matters described from time to time in our releases and publications, and in our periodic reports and other documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results, therefore, may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
