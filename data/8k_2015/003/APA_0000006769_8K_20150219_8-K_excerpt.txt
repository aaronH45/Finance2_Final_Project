 Item 5.03. Amendments To Articles Of Incorporation Or Bylaws; Change In Fiscal Year.  

On February 19, 2015, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Apache Corporation (the “Company”) amended the Company’s bylaws, effective immediately, to (i) remove references to the chairman of the board being an officer of the corporation, and (ii) remove all references to vice chairman of the board. These changes were made because the Company no longer has a combined chairman and chief executive officer.  

The foregoing description of the amendments to the Company’s bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the bylaws (as amended), a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1.
