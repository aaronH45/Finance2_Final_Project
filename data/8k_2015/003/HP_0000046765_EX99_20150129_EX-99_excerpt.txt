HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS 

Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE: HP) reported net income of $203 million ($1.85 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $1.06 billion for the first fiscal quarter of 2015, compared to net income of $173 million ($1.59 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $889 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, and net income of $169 million ($1.53 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $985 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Included in net income per diluted share corresponding to this year’s first fiscal quarter are approximately $0.13 of after-tax gains from long-term contract early termination compensation from customers, and $0.02 of after-tax gains related to the sale of used drilling equipment. Included in net income per diluted share corresponding to last year’s first and fourth fiscal quarters are $0.03 and $0.05 of after-tax gains related to the sale of used drilling equipment, respectively. 

President and CEO John Lindsay commented, “Following record levels of revenue and operating income during four consecutive years, we are pleased with the strong results in our first quarter of fiscal 2015. The strong quarter is overshadowed by a rapidly deteriorating energy market. Oil prices at six year lows are significantly impacting spot pricing and drilling activity in the U.S., and we expect this to unfavorably impact our quarterly results during the rest of fiscal 2015. Nevertheless, we believe we are positioned to successfully navigate through the down-cycle as a result of our strong balance sheet, our term contract coverage, and our modern fleet of AC drive FlexRigs®*.” 

Operating Segment Results 

Segment operating income for the Company’s U.S. land operations was $318 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, compared with $251 million for last year’s first fiscal quarter and $259 million for last year’s fourth fiscal quarter. As compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, segment operating income increased as a result of approximately $23 million in long-term contract early termination revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 along with increasing quarterly levels of activity and rig margins. Excluding the impact of $854 per day corresponding to revenues from early contract terminations during this year’s first fiscal quarter, the average rig revenue per day increased sequentially by $439 to $28,603, and the average rig margin per day increased sequentially by $563 to $15,557. The corresponding average rig expense per day declined by $124 to $13,046 and the number of quarterly revenue days increased by two percent to 27,355 days during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Rig utilization for the segment was 89% for this year’s first fiscal quarter, compared with 84% and 87% for last year’s first and fourth fiscal quarters, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the

Company’s U.S. land segment had 294 contracted and active rigs, including 177 under long-term contracts. 

Segment operating income for the Company’s offshore operations was $21.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, compared with $18.5 million for last year’s first fiscal quarter and $15.0 million for last year’s fourth fiscal quarter. The sequential increase in operating income was attributable to higher contributions from management contracts and a ten percent increase in revenue days in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The average rig margin per day decreased from $22,385 to $20,732 during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 

The Company’s international land operations reported segment operating income of $12.2 million for this year’s first fiscal quarter, compared with $12.8 million for last year’s first fiscal quarter and $5.9 million for last year’s fourth fiscal quarter. The increase in segment operating income as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 was primarily attributable to a higher average rig margin per day, which increased from $8,769 to $10,770 during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 

Drilling Operations Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2015 

In the U.S. land segment, the Company expects revenue days (activity) to decrease by roughly 25 percent during the second fiscal quarter as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact from any early termination revenue during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the average rig revenue per day is expected to decrease to between $27,000 and $27,500. The corresponding average rig expense per day is expected to increase to roughly $13,350. As of today, the U.S. land segment has 243 active rigs, including 162 under term contracts. 

In the offshore segment, the Company expects the average rig margin per day to be approximately $19,500 during the second fiscal quarter and revenue days to remain flat as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 

In the international land segment, the Company expects total revenue days during the second fiscal quarter to decrease by approximately 10 to 15 percent and the average rig margin per day to decrease by approximately 25 to 30 percent as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 

Capital Expenditures and Other Estimates for Fiscal 2015 

Given changes in market conditions and the Company’s ongoing new FlexRig construction program, the Company now expects a total of approximately $1.3 billion in capital expenditures during all of fiscal 2015. The monthly cadence of the new FlexRig construction program is now expected to decline from four to two rigs per month beginning in June through the end of the calendar year. All new FlexRigs scheduled for delivery through the end of calendar 2015 are supported with multi-year term contracts that are expected to generate attractive economic returns for the Company. Furthermore, and unlike the first fiscal quarter’s effective income tax rate of approximately 38.8% (which was impacted by changes in tax law), the Company expects an effective income tax rate of approximately 35 to 36 percent for each of the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2015.

News Release 

January 29, 2015 

Segment operating income for all segments is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company’s performance, as it excludes general and administrative expenses, corporate depreciation, income from asset sales and other corporate income and expense. The Company considers segment operating income to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company’s core businesses. This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company’s reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods. The Company believes that segment operating income is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers. Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons. However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company’s operating performance in future periods. 

The following table reconciles operating income per the information above to income from continuing operations before income taxes as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands).
