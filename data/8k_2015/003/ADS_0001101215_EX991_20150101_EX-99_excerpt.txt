ALLIANCE DATA ANNOUNCES NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM 

$600 Million Available for Repurchases during 2015 

DALLAS – Jan. 5, 2015 – Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE: ADS), a leading global provider of data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions, today announced that its board of directors has approved a new stock repurchase program to acquire up to $600 million of the Company's common stock during 2015. The new repurchase program replaces the existing program, which expired at the end of 2014. 

Repurchases will be financed through free cash flow. The Company expects to maintain moderate levels of debt over the course of the repurchase program, providing flexibility to pursue tuck-in acquisitions, portfolio purchases and/or international loyalty coalition program expansions. 

"This new repurchase program demonstrates our commitment to growing stockholder value as well as our ongoing confidence in the Company's 2015 outlook," Charles Horn, chief financial officer of Alliance Data. "On the heels of the Conversant acquisition close, we continue to seek the right opportunities to repurchase our stock, while maintaining ample liquidity to support the continued growth of the business." 

Under this repurchase program the Company is authorized to repurchase shares in open market purchases as well as in privately negotiated transactions from time to time through December 31, 2015. Stock purchased as part of this program will be held as treasury stock. The repurchase program's terms have been structured to comply with the SEC's Rule 10b-18, and the program is subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations, and other factors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated at any time.
