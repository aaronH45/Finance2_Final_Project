“As the pure-play general partner of ONEOK Partners, we continue to benefit from completed capital-growth projects at the partnership in the form of increased cash flow to ONEOK,” said Terry K. Spencer, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK. “The 44 percent increase to our dividend in 2014 compared with 2013 demonstrates our ongoing commitment to delivering shareholder value. 

“Despite the volatile fourth-quarter commodity price environment, ONEOK Partners reported a record year in 2014, with all of its business segments experiencing double-digit operating income growth compared with 2013,” continued Spencer. “With a significant platform of fee-based business, supported by a 36,000-mile integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline network positioned in growing basins and major market areas, the partnership is well-positioned to weather these types of challenging market conditions.

“ONEOK Partners’ natural gas gathering and processing, and natural gas liquids segments continued to benefit from volume growth in the fourth quarter due primarily to completed growth projects in the Williston Basin and the Mid-Continent regions and new NGL volumes from the West Texas LPG pipeline system, which it acquired late last year,” said Spencer. 

“Volume growth in the partnership’s natural gas gathering and processing segment, higher margin NGL volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections and increased natural gas volumes transported in the natural gas pipelines segment positively impacted full-year 2014 results,” he added.

2015 REVISED FINANCIAL GUIDANCE 

Due to the current commodity price environment, ONEOK is replacing all previously announced guidance expectations and financial forecasts with a revised 2015 outlook.

ONEOK reduced its 2015 cash flow available for dividends guidance to a range of $570 million to $650 million, compared with a previous guidance range of $580 million to $660 million announced on Dec. 2, 2014. 

ONEOK’s free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $90 million to $120 million, compared with the previous guidance range of $50 million to $80 million. 

“ONEOK Partners revised its 2015 distribution guidance due to the uncertain commodity price environment, which is expected to result in lower distributions received from the partnership than previously anticipated,” Spencer said. “However, additional cash available as a result of the renewal of bonus depreciation for 2014 is expected to partially offset the effect of these decreased distributions.”

2015 revised guidance now includes a projected 4 percent to 8 percent increase in ONEOK’s dividends declared compared with 2014, subject to ONEOK board approval, compared with its previous guidance of a 14 percent increase. 

Due to lower commodity prices, reduced producer drilling and the anticipated impact to natural gas volume growth, ONEOK Partners is suspending capital expenditures for the following announced capital-growth projects:

•The Demicks Lake natural gas processing plant and related infrastructure in the Williston Basin in North Dakota; 

•The Knox natural gas processing plant and related infrastructure in the Mid-Continent region in Oklahoma; and

•The Bronco natural gas processing plant and related infrastructure in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. 

“ONEOK Partners expects to resume suspended capital-growth projects and update associated completion dates as soon as market conditions improve,” said Spencer. “The planning and development the partnership has already completed puts it in a position to quickly resume these projects when the environment improves and its customers require these services.”

FOURTH-QUARTER 2014 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

ONEOK’s fourth-quarter 2014 operating income was $306.7 million, compared with $246.1 million in the fourth quarter 2013. 

Increases in fourth-quarter 2014 operating income reflect: 

•Higher natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold, and higher NGL volumes sold in the natural gas gathering and processing segment as a result of recently completed capital-growth projects;

•Higher margin NGL exchange service volumes delivered from connections with new natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent regions and new NGL volumes from the West Texas LPG pipeline system, which was acquired in November 2014; and 

•Higher short-term natural gas storage margins due to increased park-and-loan services. 

These increases were offset partially by lower net realized NGL and condensate prices in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, increased ethane rejection resulting in lower volumes in the natural gas liquids segment and higher operating costs and depreciation and amortization expense from completed capital-growth projects.

Operating costs were $181.3 million in the fourth quarter 2014, compared with $143.7 million in 2013, due to the growth of ONEOK Partners’ operations.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $80.6 million in the fourth quarter 2014, compared with $63.3 million for the same period last year, primarily as a result of the completed capital-growth projects.

Fourth-quarter 2014 equity earnings were $34.3 million, compared with equity earnings of $30.8 million in the fourth quarter 2013. 

Capital expenditures were $574.8 million in the fourth quarter 2014, compared with $658.8 million in the same period in 2013, due primarily to $85.7 million in capital expenditures for the former natural gas distribution business during the fourth quarter 2013. 

FULL-YEAR 2014 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Full-year 2014 operating income was $1.14 billion, compared with $880.6 million in 2013. Higher volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, higher margin NGL exchange-services volumes in the natural gas liquids segment and higher transportation revenues in the natural gas pipelines segment were offset partially by significantly narrower NGL location price differentials in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014 and the impact of ethane rejection in the natural gas liquids segment, and lower contracted storage capacity in the natural gas pipelines segment. 

2014 operating costs were $674.9 million, compared with $541.6 million in 2013, as a result of completed capital-growth projects at the partnership. Full-year 2014 depreciation and amortization expense was $294.7 million, compared with $239.3 million in 2013.

2014 equity earnings were $41.0 million, compared with equity earnings of $110.5 million in 2013. The decrease in equity earnings is primarily due to a $76.4 million noncash impairment charge at ONEOK Partners in the third quarter 2014. 

Capital expenditures were $1.78 billion in 2014, compared with $2.26 billion in 2013, due primarily to the timing of expenditures on capital-growth projects at the partnership and $292.1 million in capital expenditures for the former natural gas distribution business in 2013. 

ONEOK’s future cash expenditures associated with the released natural gas transportation and storage capacity from the former energy services segment are expected to be approximately $45 million on an after-tax basis, with approximately $23 million to be paid in 2015; $11 million in 2016; $6 million in 2017 and $5 million from 2018 through 2023.

BUSINESS-SEGMENT RESULTS:

Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Segment

The natural gas gathering and processing segment reported fourth-quarter 2014 operating income of $71.7 million, compared with $56.1 million in the fourth quarter 2013, which reflects: 

•A $36.2 million increase due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and the Cana-Woodford Shale, and increased ownership in the Maysville, Oklahoma, natural gas processing plant, which resulted in higher natural gas volumes gathered, compressed, processed, transported and sold, and higher NGL volumes sold; and

In March 2014, the Canadian Valley natural gas processing plant in Oklahoma was completed, which has better ethane-rejection capabilities than the partnership’s other processing plants in the Mid-Continent region. As a result, the partnership’s realized composite NGL net sales price for 2014 increased, compared with 2013, while most individual NGL product prices were lower. The Garden Creek, Garden Creek II, Garden Creek III, Stateline I and Stateline II natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin have the capability to recover ethane when economic conditions warrant but did not do so in 2014. As a result, equity NGL volumes are weighted less toward ethane, which made up approximately 10 to 15 percent of the partnership’s composite NGL barrel, and more toward propane.

The following table contains equity-volume information for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The natural gas gathering and processing segment is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of receiving commodities in exchange for services. The following tables provide hedging information for equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment in the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The partnership expects its NGL and natural gas commodity price sensitivities to increase in the future as its capital-growth projects are completed and volumes increase under percent-of-proceeds contracts, with a fee-based component, with its customers.

All of the natural gas gathering and processing segment’s commodity price sensitivities are estimated as a hypothetical change in the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as of Dec. 31, 2014, excluding the effects of hedging and assuming normal operating conditions. Condensate sales are based on the price of crude oil.

The natural gas gathering and processing segment estimates the following sensitivities:

•A 1-cent-per-gallon change in the composite price of NGLs would change 12-month forward net margin by approximately $3.0 million; 

•A 10-cent-per-MMBtu change in the price of residue natural gas would change 12-month forward net margin by approximately $5.2 million; and

•A $1.00-per-barrel change in the price of crude oil would change 12-month forward net margin by approximately $1.6 million. 

These estimates do not include any effects on demand for ONEOK Partners’ services or natural gas processing plant operations that might be caused by, or arise in conjunction with, price changes. For example, a change in the gross processing spread may cause a change in the amount of ethane extracted from the natural gas stream, affecting natural gas gathering and processing margins for certain contracts.

Natural Gas Liquids Segment

The natural gas liquids segment reported fourth-quarter 2014 operating income of $179.5 million, compared with $148.9 million in the fourth quarter 2013, which reflects: 

•A $65.0 million increase in exchange-services margins, resulting primarily from increased volumes from new natural gas processing plants connected in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent regions, new volumes from the West Texas LPG pipeline system, which was acquired in November 2014, and higher fees for exchange-service activities resulting from contract renegotiations, offset partially by lower volumes from the termination of a contract;

•A $4.1 million increase from higher isomerization volumes, resulting from wider NGL product price differentials between normal butane and iso-butane;

•An $8.9 million decrease from the impact of ethane rejection, which resulted in lower NGL volumes; 

•A $4.3 million decrease in optimization and marketing margins, which resulted primarily from a $2.3 million decrease from narrower NGL product price differentials and a $1.5 million decrease in margins due to marketing activities;

•A $1.4 million decrease in storage margins; and

•A $1.0 million decrease due to the impact of operational measurement losses.

Operating costs were $78.2 million in the fourth quarter 2014, compared with $65.5 million in the fourth quarter 2013, due primarily to completed capital-growth projects, which reflect:

-more-

And Full-year 2014 Results

February 23, 2015

Page 10

•A $5.5 million increase due to higher property taxes related to completed capital-growth projects; 

•A $3.2 million increase due to higher outside services expenses associated primarily with scheduled maintenance and the growth of operations related to completed capital-growth projects; and

•A $2.4 million increase due to higher labor and employee benefit costs. 

Depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter 2014 was $34.3 million, compared with $24.2 million in the same period in 2013, due to the completion of capital-growth projects. 

Equity earnings from investments were $13.7 million in the fourth quarter 2014, compared with $6.6 million in the same period in 2013. 

The increase in equity earnings in the fourth quarter 2014 was due primarily to higher volumes delivered to the partnership’s 50 percent-owned Overland Pass Pipeline from the Bakken NGL Pipeline, revenues from minimum volume agreements and lower operating costs, offset partially by increased ethane rejection. 

Operating income in 2014 was $689.0 million, compared with $544.9 million in 2013, which reflects:

•A $157.4 million increase in exchange-services margins, resulting primarily from increased volumes from new natural gas processing plants connected in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent regions, and higher fees from contract renegotiations for NGL exchange-services activities, offset partially by lower volumes from the termination of a contract; 

•A $79.8 million increase in optimization and marketing margins, resulting from a $31.4 million increase due primarily to wider NGL product price differentials; a $25.2 million increase in marketing margins, related primarily to increased weather-related seasonal demand for propane during the first quarter 2014, and marketing and truck and rail activities in the second, third and fourth quarters 2014; and a $23.2 million increase due primarily to significantly wider NGL location price differentials, primarily related to increased weather-related seasonal demand for propane during the first quarter 2014, offset partially by lower optimization volumes in the second, third and fourth quarters 2014 when differentials narrowed; 

•A $22.8 million increase from higher isomerization volumes, resulting from wider NGL product price differentials between normal butane and iso-butane; 

•An $18.3 million decrease from the impact of ethane rejection, which resulted in lower NGL volumes; and

•A $6.0 million decrease from the impact of lower operational measurement gains.

2014 operating costs were $296.4 million, compared with $236.6 million in 2013, which reflect:

•A $20.1 million increase due to higher outside services expenses associated primarily with scheduled maintenance and the growth of operations related to completed capital-growth projects; 

•A $15.5 million increase due to higher property taxes related to completed capital-growth projects;

•A $14.9 million increase due to higher labor and employee benefit costs; and

•A $3.4 million increase due to higher costs for chemicals, materials and supplies. 

Depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 was $124.1 million, compared with $89.2 million in 2013. 

2014 equity earnings from investments were $27.3 million, compared with $22.0 million in 2013. 

Key Statistics: More detailed information is listed on page 24 in the tables.

•NGLs transported on gathering lines were 607,000 bpd in the fourth quarter 2014, up 8 percent compared with the same period in 2013, due primarily to volumes from new plants connected in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent regions, and volumes from the West Texas LPG pipeline system, which was acquired in November 2014, offset partially by the termination of a low-margin contract and increased ethane rejection in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions; and up 15 percent compared with the third quarter 2014 due primarily to volumes received from the West Texas LPG pipeline system; 

•NGLs fractionated were 542,000 bpd in the fourth quarter 2014, up 1 percent compared with the same period in 2013, due primarily to volumes from new plants connected in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent regions, offset partially by the termination of a low-margin contract and increased ethane rejection in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions; and down 2 percent compared with the third quarter 2014; 

•NGLs transported on distribution lines were 393,000 bpd in the fourth quarter 2014, down 14 percent compared with the same period in 2013, due primarily to lower volumes transported for the partnership’s optimization business due to narrower location price differentials between the Conway and Mont Belvieu market centers and increased ethane rejection, offset partially by an increase in exchange services volumes delivered to Mont Belvieu due to the completed Sterling III pipeline, which was placed in service in March 2014; and up 4 percent compared with the third quarter 2014; and 

•The average Conway-to-Mont Belvieu price differential of ethane in ethane/propane mix, based on Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) pricing, was 1 cent per gallon in the fourth quarter 2014, compared with 5 cents per gallon in the same period in 2013; and 3 cents per gallon in the third quarter 2014.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE:

ONEOK has disclosed in this news release cash flow available for dividends, free cash flow and dividend coverage ratio, which are non-GAAP financial metrics, used to measure the company’s financial performance and are defined as follows:

•Cash flow available for dividends is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions declared from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOK’s stand-alone depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, stand-alone capital expenditures and certain other items; 

•Free cash flow is defined as cash flow available for dividends, computed as described above, less ONEOK’s dividends declared; and

•Dividend coverage ratio is defined as cash flow available for dividends divided by the dividends declared for the period.

These non-GAAP financial measures described above are useful to investors because they are used by many companies in the industry as a measurement of financial performance and are commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare our financial performance with the performance of other companies within our industry. ONEOK cash flow available for dividends, free cash flow and dividend coverage ratio should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of cash flow available for dividends and free cash flow to net income is included in the tables.
