"Our strong fourth quarter results capped off a terrific year for Autodesk," said Carl Bass, Autodesk president and CEO. "Strength in our core Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) and Manufacturing business segments led to over-performance on nearly all metrics, including billings, revenue, deferred revenue, subscription additions, and cash flow. Fiscal 2015 was the first year of our business model transition to more cloud and term-based subscription offerings and we are pleased with our early progress. Our subscription offerings provide our customers with greater flexibility and create a new and better experience. Over the course of the next two years we expect to transition the vast majority of our business to these subscription offerings."
