NEW YORK, N.Y. (January 21, 2015) - UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2014 results, highlighted by Optum’s exceptional revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings advances and broad-based strength in UnitedHealthcare’s public and senior sector benefits business.

“We enter 2015 with a positive outlook and rising business momentum. Steady innovation and year by year advances in the quality, breadth and value of our services to employers, government sponsors, consumers and care providers are creating opportunities for revenue and earnings growth in traditional and new markets,” said Stephen J. Hemsley, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.

The Company estimates 2015 revenues in a range of $140.5 billion to $141.5 billion and projects rising net earnings per share growth in 2015, to a range of $6.00 to $6.25 per share, and strong cash flows from operations in a range of $8.0 billion to $8.4 billion.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•UnitedHealth Group’s full year 2014 revenues of $130.5 billion grew $8 billion or 7 percent year-over-year. UnitedHealthcare growth was led by strength in the public and senior sector, which grew organically to serve more than 1.3 million additional people. Optum’s year-over-year revenue growth rates of 25 percent for the full year and 23 percent in the fourth quarter reflect the market’s growing response to Optum’s distinctive capabilities.

•Full year 2014 earnings from operations were $10.3 billion and net earnings were $5.6 billion, or $5.70 per share. The ACA negatively impacted full year net earnings by $1 billion or approximately $1.00 per share. Fourth quarter earnings from operations were $2.8 billion and net earnings were $1.5 billion, or $1.55 per share, as the earnings per share growth rate rose to 10 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter.

•The 2014 consolidated medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points year-over-year to 80.9 percent, reflecting the premium impact of ACA fees, partially offset by an increased mix of public and senior sector business. The fourth quarter medical care ratio of 79.8 percent decreased 140 basis points year-over-year, due to the impact of ACA fees and improved premium yields, partially offset by business mix.

•Favorable reserve development was $100 million in the fourth quarter, including $40 million related to the prior year’s medical services, compared to a total of $170 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, including $100 million related to the previous year’s services. Overall medical cost trends remained well controlled, with decreased inpatient hospital usage per person in 2014.

•Meaningful improvements in productivity and operating efficiency in 2014 were more than offset by 120 basis points of ACA fees and taxes and the growing mix of health care services business, as the operating cost ratio increased 80 basis points to 16.6 percent. The seasonally higher fourth quarter operating cost ratio of 17.5 percent increased 130 basis points year-over-year due to ACA costs and health care services business growth.

•The full year 2014 tax rate of 41.8 percent increased 540 basis points year-over-year due to ACA taxes.

•Cash flows from operations grew 15 percent year-over-year to $8.1 billion, exceeding 1.4x net earnings for the year. Fourth quarter cash flows from operations grew to $2.4 billion, or 1.6x net earnings.

•Fourth quarter 2014 days sales outstanding in accounts receivable of 12 days increased 3 days year-over-year, reflecting the growing revenue contribution from state and federal customers and health care services business. Fourth quarter 2014 days claims payable of 47 days were stable year-over-year, and within the expected range of 47 to 50 days.

•The Company’s balance sheet remained strong, with nearly $1 billion of cash available for corporate use and a debt to total capital ratio of 35 percent at December 31, 2014. Return on equity again exceeded 17 percent in 2014.

•UnitedHealth Group repurchased $4 billion in stock in 2014 at an average price of approximately $82.60 per share, and paid $1.4 billion in shareholder dividends, up 29 percent year-over-year. The dividend was increased by 34 percent in June 2014 to an annual rate of $1.50 per share.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Full year 2014 UnitedHealthcare revenues of $119.8 billion grew $6.1 billion or 5 percent year-over-year, as an anticipated decline in people served through commercial benefits was more than offset by strong growth in people served in the public and senior sector.

•UnitedHealthcare earnings from operations of $7 billion for full year 2014 decreased $140 million year-over-year, including $49 million in the fourth quarter.

UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual

•UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual revenues decreased $1.8 billion to $43 billion in 2014 due principally to a decrease of 680,000 people served through risk-based products over the course of the year.

•UnitedHealthcare expanded its Medicaid services to reach more than 1 million additional people in 2014, including 135,000 people in the fourth quarter, and now serves in excess of 5 million Americans through community-based health benefit programs.

UnitedHealthcare Global

•UnitedHealthcare Global’s revenues of $6.9 billion grew $552 million or 9 percent year-over-year in 2014, with increased revenue yields and hospital services revenue growth more than offsetting a 380,000 member reduction related to strengthened pricing for insurance products.
