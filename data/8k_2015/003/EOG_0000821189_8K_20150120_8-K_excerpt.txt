EOG RESOURCES, INC.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

I. Price Risk Management

With the objective of enhancing the certainty of future revenues, from time to time EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) enters into New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) related financial price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts. EOG accounts for financial commodity derivative contracts using the mark-to-market accounting method. In addition to financial transactions, from time to time EOG is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions. The financial impact of these physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement, which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices.

For the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG anticipates a non-cash net gain of $750.2 million on the mark-to-market of its crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts was $222.9 million.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2014, NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil averaged $73.12 per barrel, and NYMEX natural gas at Henry Hub averaged $3.95 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). EOG's actual realizations for crude oil and natural gas for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, differ from these NYMEX prices due to delivery location and quality adjustments.

II. Crude Oil Derivative Contracts

Since filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, on November 4, 2014 (Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), EOG has not entered into additional crude oil derivative contracts. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil derivative contracts at January 20, 2015, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)EOG has entered into crude oil derivative contracts which give counterparties the option to extend certain current derivative contracts for additional six-month periods. Options covering a notional volume of 37,000 Bbld are exercisable on June 30, 2015. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 37,000 Bbld at an average price of $91.56 per barrel for each month during the period July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.

III. Natural Gas Derivative Contracts

Since filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, EOG has entered into additional natural gas derivative contracts. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas derivative contracts at January 20, 2015, with notional volumes expressed in MMBtu per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)EOG has entered into natural gas derivative contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates. All such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 175,000 MMBtud at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month during the period February 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.

IV. Forward-Looking Statements

Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will," "should" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others:

•the timing and extent of changes in prices for, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and related commodities;

•the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves;

•the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, and optimize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects;

•the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil, natural gas and related commodity production;

•the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, transportation and refining facilities;

•the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG's ability to retain mineral licenses and leases;

•the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities;

•EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties;

•the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically;

•competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services;

•the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water) and services;

•the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise;

•weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by EOG or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression and transportation facilities;

•the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG;

•EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements;

•the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG;

•the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions;

•political conditions and developments around the world (such as political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates;

4

•the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources;

•the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage;

•acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts;

•physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; and

•the other factors described under ITEM 1A, "Risk Factors", on pages 17 through 26 of EOG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.
