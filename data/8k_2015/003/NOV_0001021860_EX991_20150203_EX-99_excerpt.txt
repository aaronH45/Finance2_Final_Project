Clay C. Williams, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, stated, “NOV accomplished a great deal in 2014, and I want to thank all of our employees for our record results. We completed the spin-off of our distribution business to our shareholders, we substantially increased our regular dividend and we launched a $3 billion share repurchase program. We also effected a reorganization of our operations to better serve our customers, while expanding our global reach and furthering our technology and product portfolio through the year.  

Looking into 2015 we face a very challenging market. Our customers are sharply reducing their oilfield activity and expenditures. Nevertheless, NOV’s strong backlog of capital equipment orders, our leading service and technology franchises, strong financial resources and positive cash flow position us well to navigate this cyclical decline. In the meantime we will continue to pursue strategic opportunities arising from the current market, to position the Company to emerge better and stronger from this cyclical decline.”

Note 1: In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose various non-GAAP financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases and other public disclosures. The primary non-GAAP financial measures we focus on are: (i) revenue excluding other items, (ii) operating profit excluding other items, (iii) operating profit percentage excluding other items, (iv) operating profit excluding other items before depreciation & amortization, (v) operating profit percentage excluding other items before depreciation & amortization (vi) EBITDA and (vii) Operating (non-GAAP) per fully diluted share. Each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain other items and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure is included here within.  

We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate and manage the Company’s operations because we believe it provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s on-going economic performance. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform more meaningful comparisons of operating results and as a means to emphasize the results of on-going operations.
