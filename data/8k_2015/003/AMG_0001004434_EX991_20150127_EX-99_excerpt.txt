“AMG’s fourth quarter results marked a strong finish to 2014, with Economic earnings per share of $3.55 for the quarter and a record $11.45 for the full year,” stated Sean M. Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMG. “Our results reflect excellent execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including continued strong growth from net client cash flows, the long-term investment outperformance of our Affiliates, and significant deployment of capital through our new investments strategy. The addition of four new Affiliates during the year, along with our additional investment in AQR, demonstrates the ongoing success of our strategy to partner with the highest-quality boutiques worldwide, and meaningfully enhances the earnings power of our business as well as our position in the most attractive return-oriented product areas globally.” 

“Our global distribution strategy has now generated strong organic growth from net client cash flows into actively-managed products for nineteen consecutive quarters — which is particularly notable given the muted investor risk appetite observed by the industry generally,” Mr. Healey continued. “During the fourth quarter, our Affiliates won new mandates and follow-on fundings across all of our institutional coverage regions, from global clients seeking differentiated, value-added strategies in active equities and alternatives. While strong inflows to our Affiliates’ global equity and alternative products were somewhat offset by outflows in U.S. equities in the U.S. retail channel, which was consistent with the broader industry trends, we have entered 2015 with a strong book of prospective new business, and are well-positioned for continued organic growth from net client cash flows.” 

“Finally, following an excellent 2014, in which we deployed over $1.3 billion through our new investments strategy, we continue to have a substantial pipeline of outstanding prospective Affiliates,” Mr. Healey concluded. “AMG’s opportunity set includes a broad array of highly-regarded traditional and alternative firms globally, and with our two-decade track record of successful partnerships and an unparalleled distribution capability for boutique firms, AMG is uniquely attractive as a permanent partner to the best boutiques in the world. We are confident in our ability to generate meaningful earnings growth through additional accretive investments in outstanding new Affiliates going forward.”

Notes 

(in millions, except per share data) 

(A) Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of intangible amortization (including equity method intangible amortization) and impairments, deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents operating performance before non-cash expenses relating to the acquisition of interests in our affiliated investment management firms, and it is therefore employed as our principal performance benchmark. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measure of financial performance or liquidity. 

We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in the value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders. 

(B) EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that many investors use this information when comparing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. EBITDA (controlling interest), as calculated by us, may not be consistent with computations of EBITDA by other companies. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measure of financial performance or liquidity. 

(C) Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the adjusted diluted average shares outstanding. In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of the convertible securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion. Economic earnings per share is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Earnings per share - diluted or any other GAAP measure of financial performance.

(D) We completed our investment in SouthernSun Asset Management, LLC in the first quarter of 2014; we completed our investments in EIG Global Energy Partners, LLC and River Road Asset Management, LLC in the second quarter of 2014; and we completed our investment in Veritas Asset Management LLP in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

(E) Other primarily includes assets under management attributable to Affiliate product transitions, new investment client transitions and transfers of our interests in certain Affiliated investment management firms, the financial effects of which are not material to our ongoing results. 

(F) In the first quarter of 2014, we settled our 2006 junior convertible trust preferred securities and recognized a one-time expense of $18.8 ($11.6 net of tax) primarily related to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the debt. 

(G) Our consolidated income tax provision includes taxes attributable to controlling interests, and to a lesser extent, taxes attributable to non-controlling interests, as follows:
