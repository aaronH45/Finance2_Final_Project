The text of the Press Release is as follows:

HALLIBURTON ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.19 PER DILUTED SHARE, EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS

•Reported income from continuing operations of $1.06 per diluted share

HOUSTON - Jan 20, 2015 - Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) announced today that income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.0 billion, or $1.19 per diluted share, excluding restructuring charges of $90 million, after-tax, or $0.11 per diluted share, and Baker Hughes acquisition-related costs of $19 million, after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2014 of $1.0 billion, or $1.19 per diluted share, excluding Macondo-related items.

Reported income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $900 million, or $1.06 per diluted share. Reported income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2014 was $1.1 billion, or $1.33 per diluted share.

Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $8.8 billion, compared to $8.7 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion in both the fourth and third quarters of 2014. Reported operating income was $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2014.

Total revenue was $32.9 billion for the full year 2014, an increase of $3.5 billion, or 12%, from 2013. Total operating income was $5.1 billion for 2014, compared to $3.1 billion for 2013, which increased primarily due to increased stimulation activity in the United States land market, and Macondo-related items. 

Adjusted income from continuing operations for the full year 2014 was $3.4 billion, or $4.02 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted income from continuing operations for the full year 2013 of $2.8 billion, or $3.15 per diluted share. Reported income from continuing operations for the full year 2014 was $3.4 billion, or $4.03 per diluted share, compared to $2.1 billion, or $2.33 per diluted share, for the full year 2013.

“I am very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year,” commented Dave Lesar, chairman and chief executive officer.

“For the full year 2014, Halliburton reported record revenue and operating income for the total company, as well as revenue records for both divisions and 12 out of 13 product lines. Compared to our primary peers, the company once again delivered industry-leading total company revenue growth and returns in 2014. 

“North America delivered a record year, with 16% revenue growth and 23% adjusted operating income growth compared to 2013. The Eastern Hemisphere also had a record year, with revenue and adjusted operating income growth of 10% and 12%, respectively. 

“For the fourth quarter, total company revenue of $8.8 billion was a record quarter, with revenue records for both divisions and our Middle East/Asia region setting a new record for both revenue and adjusted operating income. 

“North America revenue was flat sequentially, despite the seasonal impact from weather and holiday downtime. Margins benefited in the fourth quarter from cost efficiencies related to the continued roll-out of our strategic initiatives, as well as recent enhancements to our logistics network. 

“In the Eastern Hemisphere, we experienced a modest level of sequential revenue growth which resulted in a new quarterly record, despite headwinds in our Europe/Africa/CIS region. 

“In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased by 10% compared to the third quarter, and adjusted fourth quarter margins came in just under 21%. Year-end software and equipment sales led the improvement for the quarter, along with increased integrated project activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India and Indonesia.

”In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue and adjusted operating income declined 8% and 35%, respectively, compared to the third quarter. This resulted from activity declines in the North Sea, Russia, and Angola, as well as currency weakness in Russia. 

“In Latin America, revenue increased 3% sequentially, while adjusted operating income declined 4% compared to the third quarter. Operating income was negatively impacted during the fourth quarter from mobilization costs in Brazil and budget constraints affecting consulting and stimulation activity in Mexico.

“We delivered an excellent 2014, but it is clear that 2015 will be a challenging year for the industry. As a result of the weakening outlook, during the fourth quarter of 2014 we took a $129 million restructuring charge to temper the impact of anticipated activity declines. Halliburton has successfully weathered multiple industry cycles. We are confident that we have the right people, technology, and strategies in place to outperform throughout this cycle too, and emerge as a stronger company,” concluded Lesar.

Completion and Production

Completion and Production (C&P) revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $5.5 billion, which was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Increased completion tools sales across all regions and increased stimulation activity in the United States land market and Middle East/Asia region were partially offset by decreased activity and currency weakness in Russia and Norway, decreased activity across most product lines in Mexico, and a seasonal reduction in pipeline services in the Europe/Africa/CIS region.

C&P operating income in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $991 million, a decrease of $80 million, or 7%, from the third quarter of 2014. Excluding restructuring charges, C&P adjusted operating income decreased $20 million, or 2%, compared to the third quarter of 2014. North America C&P adjusted operating income increased $12 million, or 2%, sequentially, mainly due to increased cementing activity and completion tools sales in the United States. Latin America C&P adjusted operating income decreased $12 million, or 18%, compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower activity across all product lines in Mexico. Europe/Africa/CIS C&P adjusted operating income decreased $37 million, or 29%, sequentially, mainly due to lower profitability in the North Sea, Russia, and Angola. Middle East/Asia C&P adjusted operating income increased $17 million, or 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to increased stimulation activity in Malaysia, Australia, and Saudi Arabia.

Drilling and Evaluation

Drilling and Evaluation (D&E) revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $3.3 billion, which was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Strong growth across most product lines in the Middle East/Asia region was partially offset by decreased activity in the Europe/Africa/CIS region.

Halliburton/Page 4

D&E operating income in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $408 million, a decrease of $43 million, or 10%, from the third quarter of 2014. Excluding restructuring charges, D&E adjusted operating income increased $26 million, or 6%, compared to the third quarter of 2014. North America D&E adjusted operating income was flat, sequentially, as higher software sales in the United States land market were offset by decreased drilling activity in the United States land market and Canada. Latin America D&E adjusted operating income increased $6 million, or 8%, compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to increased fluid services in Mexico and higher software sales in Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico, which were partially offset by reduced testing profitability in Brazil and a decline in consulting services in Mexico. Europe/Africa/CIS D&E adjusted operating income decreased $38 million, or 42%, sequentially, due to lower activity and currency weakness in Russia and Norway. Middle East/Asia D&E adjusted operating income increased $58 million, or 39%, sequentially, mainly due to strong growth across most product lines, including higher software and product sales in China and increased drilling activity in Saudi Arabia.

Corporate and Other

During the fourth quarter of 2014, Halliburton incurred $19 million for costs related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition, $17 million of which is recorded in Corporate and Other expense, and $2 million of which is recorded in Interest Expense, Net.

Significant Recent Events and Achievements
