Exhibit 99.1  

Visa Inc. Reports Fiscal First Quarter 2015 Net Income of $1.6 billion or $2.53 per Diluted Share and Announces a Four-for-One Stock Split  

Foster City, CA, January 29, 2015 – Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced financial results for the Company’s fiscal first quarter 2015. Net income for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year, or $2.53 per share, an increase of 15% over the prior year. All references to earnings per share assume fully-diluted class A share count unless otherwise noted.  

Net operating revenue in the fiscal first quarter of 2015 was $3.4 billion, an increase of 7% nominally or 9% on a constant dollar basis over the prior year, driven by solid growth in service revenues, data processing revenues and international transaction revenues. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted net operating revenues by approximately 2 percentage points of negative growth during the quarter.  

“Visa kicked-off fiscal 2015 delivering another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth. While the challenges of the macro global environment don’t seem to abate, our results have remained consistent and reflect the strength and underlying resilience of our business model,” said Charlie Scharf, Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. “Our focus remains squarely on investing in our long-term strategic initiatives, driving new technologies and ways to pay as we continue to work collaboratively with governments, issuers, acquirers, and merchant partners.”  

The Company also announces its board of directors has authorized a four-for-one stock split. Trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on March 19, 2015.

Footnote  

Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands for the relevant period; and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments volume plus cash volume.  

Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa’s signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs.  

The data presented is based on results reported quarterly by Visa’s financial institution clients on their operating certificates. Estimates may be utilized if data is unavailable.  

On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates, if any, are not material.  

Visa’s CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Effective with the 3 months ended September 2013, Croatia moved from the CEMEA region to Visa Europe. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. International includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA and LAC.  

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported (“Nominal USD”). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information (“Constant USD”). This presentation represents Visa’s historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.
