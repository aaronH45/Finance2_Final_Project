I am proud of this great company, its exceptional management team and employees, and everything we are achieving for our clients, shareholders and communities. Each of our businesses and the company are very well positioned going into 2015 for long-term growth and success.”

Net income was $2.2 billion, a decrease of $269 million, or 11%, compared with the prior year, due to higher provision for credit losses and lower net revenue, largely offset by lower noninterest expense.

Net revenue was $10.9 billion, a decrease of $490 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year.

The total consumer provision for credit losses was $946 million, compared with $65 million in the prior year. The current-quarter consumer provision reflected a $250 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses, compared to a $1.2 billion reduction in the prior year. The current-quarter consumer allowance release primarily reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquency trends in the residential real estate portfolio and the impact of the sustained improvement in the economy on the credit card portfolio. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.2 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.28% and 1.44%, respectively. 

The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $106 million, compared with an expense of $39 million in the prior year. Wholesale net charge-offs were $26 million, compared with $22 million in the prior year, resulting in a net charge-off rate of 0.03% for both periods. 

The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 1.55%, compared with 1.80% in the prior year. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans retained1, excluding credit card, was 106%, compared with 100% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.0 billion, down from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $8.4 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively.

Noninterest expense was $15.4 billion, down $143 million, or 1%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower noninterest expense in Mortgage Banking, predominantly offset by higher noninterest expense in the Corporate & Investment Bank. The current quarter noninterest expense included approximately $1.1 billion of legal expense, compared with approximately $847 million of legal expense in the prior year.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:

a.In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's consolidated results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total consolidated net revenue for the Firm (and for each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income/(loss) as reported by the Firm or on net income/(loss) as reported by the lines of business.

b.The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained, and the allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans retained, exclude the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, net charge-offs and net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans.

c.Tangible common equity (“TCE”) and return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. TCE and ROTCE are meaningful to management, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity, as well as facilitating comparisons of the Firm with competitors.

d.Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital and the CET1 ratio under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the U.S. final SLR rule, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Regulatory capital on pages 161-165 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and on pages 73-77 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014.

e.The CIB provides non-GAAP financial measures, as such measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for comparability with peers.

•The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.

•ROE for the fourth quarter 2014 is calculated excluding legal expense.

•Prior to January 1, 2014, the CIB provided non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of FVA (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA on net revenue and net income. Beginning in the first quarter 2014, the Firm does not exclude FVA and DVA from its assessment of business performance, with the exception of certain refinements to net FVA and DVA in the fourth quarter 2014; however, the Firm continues to present these non-GAAP measures for the periods prior to January 1, 2014, as they reflected how management assessed the underlying business performance of the CIB in those prior periods.

•The change in Fixed Income Markets revenue excludes the revenue decline related to business simplification, including the sales of Physical Commodities and Global Special Opportunities Group businesses.
