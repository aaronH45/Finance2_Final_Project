Item 8.01 Other Events.

On January 15, 2015, a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise and Release (the “Stipulation”) was entered into with respect to the consolidated stockholder derivative litigation captioned In Re: Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. Derivative Litigation, C.A. No. 8145-VCN. The settlement is subject to specified conditions, including final approval by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. This settlement will resolve all pending derivative claims against directors and officers of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the “Company”) challenging the Company’s 2013 acquisitions of Plains Exploration & Production Company and McMoRan Exploration Co. 

Pursuant to the Stipulation, insurers under the directors and officers liability insurance policies of the Company will fund to the Company $115 million (the “Settlement Amount”). The settlement is conditioned upon the Company’s Board of Directors resolving to declare a special dividend in an aggregate amount not less than the net proceeds received by the Company in respect of the settlement (i.e., the Settlement Amount less plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and expenses as awarded by the Court) plus an additional $22.5 million to be funded by the Company. The special dividend is to be paid at the time of the issuance of, and with the same record date to be established for, the next quarterly dividend announced after the Settlement Amount is received by the Company. 

The settlement is also conditioned upon the Company’s Board of Directors approving and agreeing to keep in effect for at least three years corporate governance enhancements specified in the Stipulation. These corporate governance enhancements include agreements by the Company to maintain and/or establish (1) a lead independent director position, (2) an independent executive committee, (3) solely independent directors on each of the executive, corporate responsibility, audit, compensation and nominating and governance committees, and (4) certain procedures or policies relating to the selection of members of special committees, approval of related-party transactions, and executive compensation.

The settling defendants entered into the Stipulation to avoid the costs and distraction of continued litigation and continue to deny all allegations of wrongdoing or fault in the litigation.

For additional information about the litigation, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014.

The foregoing description of the Stipulation does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Stipulation, which is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
