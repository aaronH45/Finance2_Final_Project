CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 

FOURTH QUARTER: Revenue increased 30 percent to $1.5 billion while adjusted EBITDA, net increased 32 percent to $383 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. EPS decreased 52 percent to $0.86 for the fourth quarter of 2014, due to $2.05 in acquisition related charges. Core EPS, which excludes these charges, increased 44 percent to $3.45 for the fourth quarter of 2014. The acquisition related charges are comprised of $7 million in direct transaction costs associated with the Conversant acquisition and a $106 million one-time earn-out charge associated with the BrandLoyalty acquisition. 

Diluted shares outstanding were 61.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, down approximately 7 percent compared to the same period in 2013. The issuance of 4.6 million shares on December 10, 2014 in connection with the Conversant acquisition added 1.1 million shares to the diluted share count for the fourth quarter of 2014. 

FULL YEAR: Revenue increased 23 percent to $5.3 billion while adjusted EBITDA, net increased 14 percent to $1.4 billion for 2014. EPS increased 6 percent to $7.87, reduced for the acquisition related charges discussed above, while core EPS increased 26 percent to $12.56 for 2014, exceeding guidance of $12.40. 

Diluted shares outstanding were 62.4 million for 2014, down approximately 7 percent compared to 2013. The issuance of 4.6 million shares on December 10, 2014 in connection with the Conversant acquisition added a nominal 0.2 million to the diluted share count for 2014. 

The Company's effective tax rate was 36.2 percent in 2014, excluding the impact of the costs/charges discussed above, compared to 37.5 percent in 2013. The improvement from 2013 is due to international expansion. The Company expects a similar rate for 2015. 

Ed Heffernan, president and chief executive officer, commented, "2014 was, first and foremost, a year about growth. Our Company added $1 billion to its top-line, representing a 23 percent increase compared to last year. Most notably, our organic growth rate was about 11 percent, or 4 times GDP growth, above our long-term target. In addition, we augmented our growth rate by expanding our international footprint with the addition of BrandLoyalty, and our digital product offering with the addition of Conversant during the year. This balanced growth was not at the expense of profitability, however, as we increased core EPS by 26 percent." 

Heffernan continued, "LoyaltyOne had a solid year with revenue and adjusted EBITDA up 53 percent and 36 percent, respectively. On a constant currency basis, the Canadian business produced flat top- and bottom-line results in a somewhat challenging environment. AIR MILES® reward miles issued increased a disappointing 1 percent for 2014. Conversely, our European loyalty business grew its revenue and adjusted EBITDA, net at the fastest clip of any of Alliance Data's businesses. Overall, LoyaltyOne delivered

Alliance Data Systems Corporation 

February 5, 2015  

solid organic top-line growth of 9 percent including the pro-forma 2013 results for BrandLoyalty (i.e., prior to our ownership). 

"Epsilon had a mixed year with revenue up 10 percent, driven by solid organic revenue growth of 7 percent, while adjusted EBITDA, net increased 7 percent compared to 2013. We incurred significant costs with both the ramp-up of a large client as well as greater than expected human capital costs, which prevented us from achieving the margin expansion we had expected for 2014. Epsilon has shifted to a more labor-intensive business over the last several years and, as such, we are looking to expand our off-shoring initiatives in 2015 in order to moderate the growth rate in our human capital costs. 

"Private Label had another banner year with revenue and adjusted EBITDA, net up 18 percent and 16 percent, respectively, compared to 2013. We successfully leveraged a market receptive to our distinct offering by signing a record number of new clients in 2014. On top of that, we were able to increase our tender share - percentage of client sales on our card to total client sales - at existing clients by about 150 basis points. This recent holiday season is a great example of this tender share pickup. While our clients enjoyed total sales gains in the 3 to 4 percent range, sales on our card products at those clients grew approximately 12 percent." 

SEGMENT REVIEW 

LoyaltyOne: Revenue increased 62 percent to $398 million and adjusted EBITDA, net increased 41 percent to $96 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Unfavorable Canadian translation rates negatively impacted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, net by $16 million and $5 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2014. 

AIR MILES reward miles issued increased 11 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 due to increased promotional activity by several sponsors, while AIR MILES reward miles redeemed decreased 7 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to fewer redemptions for air travel. 

Epsilon: Revenue increased 18 percent to $440 million and adjusted EBITDA, net increased 9 percent to $102 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, aided by the acquisition of Conversant. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 23 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014, down 180 basis points from the prior year primarily due to integration costs associated with the Conversant acquisition. 

Agility Harmony®, the Company's digital messaging platform, continues to ramp-up with email volumes up over 39 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Importantly, Epsilon added to Agility Harmony's and its mobile, social, video and targeted display capabilities with the acquisition of Conversant, Inc. on December 10, 2014.

  Private Label Services and Credit: Revenue increased 24 percent to $654 million and adjusted EBITDA, net increased 43 percent to $212 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. 

Operating expenses increased 21 percent to $263 million, while the loan loss provision increased 10 percent to $143 million, benefitting from a decline in principal loss rates. Portfolio funding costs were $35 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, or 1.4 percent of average credit card receivables, 20 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2013. 

Credit sales increased 31 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014, supported by a 12 percent increase in core cardholder spending. Average credit card receivables increased 30 percent to $10.1 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, while principal loss rates decreased 140 basis points to 3.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014. 

2015 Guidance: 

  ·   Revenue of $6.5 billion, a 23 percent increase. This is a decrease from $6.625 billion, a 25 percent increase, in the original guidance due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since the date of that guidance;     

  ·   Core EPS of $14.80, an 18 percent increase; and     

  ·   Diluted share count between 64 million to 64.7 million.     

Despite unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds, the Company expects revenue of approximately $1.54 billion and core EPS of approximately $3.40, increases of 25 percent and 22 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2015.
