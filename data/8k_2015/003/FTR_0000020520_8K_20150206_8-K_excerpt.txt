 Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

 On February 5, 2015, during a conference call to announce the Company’s pending acquisition of properties from Verizon Communications Inc., John Jureller, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Frontier Communications Corporation (the “Company”), made the following comments regarding certain year-end 2014 financial results. As mentioned on the call, these results are based on the most recent information available to the Company’s management. These estimates and ranges are preliminary, unaudited, and may be revised. Final results, as reported on the Company’s earnings call on February 19, 2015, may differ from these estimates.  

 **********  

 As a preview of our earnings announcement on February 19th, and subject to the caution that the following amounts remain subject to completion of our audit and, therefore, may be revised: in the fourth quarter of 2014, we had revenues of approximately $1,330 million, adjusted EBITDA of $568 million and Free Cash Flow of $193 million. For the full year of 2014, we had revenues of approximately $4,772 million, adjusted EBITDA of $2,084 million and Free Cash Flow of $793 million. The annual Free Cash Flow result is $13 million above the high end of our prior guidance range of $755 - $780 million. On our February 19th earnings call, after our financials are fully audited, we will be providing more in-depth information about the performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2014, and we will also provide our full year 2015 guidance.
