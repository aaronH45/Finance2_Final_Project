EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS 

· THV Performance Drives Fourth Quarter Sales Growth of 15% 

· Full Year 2015 Non-GAAP EPS Guidance Raised to $4.00 to $4.30 

IRVINE, Calif., February 3, 2015 — Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), the global leader in the science of heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring, today reported net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 of $109.2 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, and non-GAAP1 net income of $116.5 million, or $1.06 per diluted share. Net income for the same period a year earlier was $75.1 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $105.0 million, or $0.95 per diluted share. 

Net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 increased 15 percent to $618.0 million compared to the same period last year. Underlying2 sales grew 16 percent to $614.2 million. U.S. and international segment sales for the fourth quarter were $286.6 million and $331.4 million, respectively. 

“In 2014, we were pleased to introduce several innovative products that helped us maintain our strong global leadership position. We are particularly gratified to see the meaningful impact that our dedicated employees have in helping so many patients around the world,” said Michael A. Mussallem, chairman and CEO. “For the quarter, we experienced robust growth across all regions, which was again led by transcatheter heart valves sales that exceeded our expectations, most notably in Europe.” 

Sales Results 

For the fourth quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy sales (THV) of $267.5 million, a 46 percent growth rate over the fourth quarter last year. On an underlying basis, THV sales grew 38 percent. These results were driven by strong  

sales of the company’s innovative SAPIEN 3 valve in Europe and SAPIEN XT valve in the U.S. Globally, average selling prices remained stable. 

In the U.S., THV sales for the quarter, including royalties, were $129.5 million. On an underlying basis sales grew 36 percent to $126.4 million. 

“Outside the U.S., THV sales grew 41 percent on an underlying basis during the quarter, once again driven by strong procedure growth across most countries in Europe,” said Mussallem. “While we expect this procedure growth rate to slow and competition to build, we continue to believe there are large numbers of untreated patients who can benefit from transcatheter aortic valve replacement therapy.” 

Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group sales for the quarter were $206.1 million. Reported sales were comparable to the fourth quarter last year, and on an underlying basis increased 3.2 percent. Heart valve unit gains across most geographies drove the majority of this quarter’s growth, partially offset by the expected reduction of Cardiac Surgery Systems product sales. 

Critical Care product group sales were $144.4 million for the quarter, which were comparable to the fourth quarter last year, and on an underlying basis grew 4.3 percent. Growth was solid in the U.S., and sales outside the U.S. were aided by a favorable comparison as inventory levels stabilized in China. Enhanced Surgical Recovery product sales, including FloTrac and ClearSight, grew double-digits. 

Additional Operating Results 

For the quarter, the company’s gross profit margin was 74.0 percent, compared to 73.2 percent in the same period last year. This increase was driven primarily by a more profitable product mix and a positive impact from foreign exchange. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $223.1 million for the quarter compared to $186.6 million in the prior year. The largest drivers of the increase were related to the company’s global expansion of transcatheter heart valves, and a larger accrual for incentive compensation. 

Research and development investments for the quarter were $84.0 million compared to $78.6 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in the company’s aortic and mitral valve programs, partially offset by lower spending on clinical trials this quarter.

Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $93.2 million. After capital spending of $34.5 million and excluding the tax impacts of previously reported special items, free cash flow was $107.5 million. 

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014. Total debt was $598.1 million. 

Twelve-Month Results 

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the company recorded net income of $811.1 million, or $7.48 per diluted share. Excluding special items, net income was $379.6 million, or $3.50 per diluted share, representing 8.4 percent growth over the prior year. 

Net sales for the twelve months of 2014 increased 13.6 percent to $2.3 billion. Sales growth was 13.3 percent on an underlying basis. 

U.S. and international segment sales for the twelve months of 2014 were $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. 

Cash flow from operating activities for the year was approximately $1.0 billion. After capital spending of $82.9 million and excluding the impacts of special items, free cash flow was $444.5 million. 

During 2014, the company repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock for $300.9 million. 

Outlook 

Based on current foreign exchange rates, the company expects an approximate $160 million negative impact to full year 2015 reported sales compared to the prior year. The corresponding profit impact is mitigated by the company’s foreign exchange hedging program. As a result, Edwards expects full year reported sales to be at the lower end of its previously provided $2.3 to $2.5 billion range. Given the momentum in transcatheter heart valve sales, the company is raising its full year 2015 diluted EPS guidance to $4.00 to $4.30, excluding special items. 

For the first quarter of 2015, at current foreign exchange rates the company projects total sales to be between $570 million and $610 million, and diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be between $1.02 and $1.10.

“Our foundation of leadership and our commitment to transform patient care with innovative therapies remain the source of our strength,” said Mussallem. “Edwards is poised for solid growth in 2015, and our exciting product pipeline positions us well for continued longer-term success and greater shareholder value.”

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION 

Non-GAAP Financial Information 

To supplement the consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses non-GAAP historical financial measures. The Company uses the term “underlying” when referring to non-GAAP sales information, which excludes foreign exchange fluctuations, as well as adjustments for discontinued and acquired products and sales return reserves associated with transcatheter heart valve therapy (“THV”) product upgrades, and “excluding special items” to also exclude gains and losses from special items such as significant investments, litigation, and business development transactions, and for 2012 to include the tax benefit for the U.S. Research and Development (“R&D”) tax credit, which was required to be included in 2013. Guidance for sales and sales growth rates is provided on an “underlying basis,” and projections for diluted earnings per share, net income and growth, gross profit margin, taxes and free cash flow are also provided on the same non-GAAP (or “excluding special items”) basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP items, to expected reported results due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of special charges or gains, and management’s inability to forecast charges associated with future transactions and initiatives. Management does not consider the excluded items or adjustments as part of day-to-day business or reflective of the core operational activities of the Company as they result from transactions outside the ordinary course of business. 

Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s core operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP historical financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables below. 

The items described below are adjustments to the GAAP financial results in the reconciliations that follow: 

THV Sales Return Reserve and Related Costs - In the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first and second quarters of 2014, the Company recorded a net sales return reserve and related costs, primarily related to inventory reserves, of $15.2 million, $15.6 million, and $6.1 million, respectively, related to estimated THV product returns expected upon introduction of next-generation THV products. In the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company recorded a net reversal of the reserve of $16.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, upon delivery of the next-generation THV products. 

Intellectual Property Litigation Expense (Income), net - The Company incurred intellectual property litigation expenses of $5.5 million and $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively, $2.6 million and $5.5 million in the second quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively, $0.9 million and $4.3 million in the third quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $0.6 million and $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, in the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded a $750.0 million gain related to an agreement with Medtronic to settle all outstanding patent litigation. In the first quarter of 2013, the Company recorded an $83.6 million gain related to the April 2010 jury award from Medtronic of damages for infringement of the U.S. Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent. 

Acquisition of in-process research and development - The Company recorded a $10.2 million charge related to the acquisition of transcatheter mitral valve intellectual property in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

Asset Write-down - The Company recorded a $5.0 million charge in the third quarter of 2014 to write-down assets related to its automated glucose monitoring program. The charge related primarily to intellectual property, fixed assets, inventory and severance expenses. The Company recorded a $5.9 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to the impairment of in-process research and development assets. 

Charitable Foundation Contribution - The Company recorded a $50.0 million charge in the second quarter of 2014 for a charitable contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation. 

Settlement - The Company recorded a $7.5 million charge in the first quarter of 2014 to settle past and future obligations related to one of its intellectual property agreements. 

Worldwide Realignment - The Company recorded a $10.4 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global workforce realignment. 

Provision for Income Taxes - During the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded a $6.2 million tax benefit due to the remeasurement of its uncertain tax positions. During the first quarter of 2013, the Company recorded an $8.4 million income tax benefit relating to the federal R&D tax credit that was extended in 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. 

Foreign Exchange - Fluctuation in exchange rates impacts the comparative results and sales growth rates of the Company’s underlying business. Management believes that excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations from its sales growth provides investors a more meaningful comparison to historical financial results. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has been detailed in the “Unaudited Reconciliation of Sales by Product Group and Region.” 

Free Cash Flow - The Company defines free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. During 2014, the Company excluded from its calculation of free cash flow the impacts of the payment from Medtronic for the litigation settlement and its contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation. During 2013, the Company excluded the impact of another payment from Medtronic related to litigation.
