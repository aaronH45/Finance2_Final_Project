Double Trigger Vesting  

On February 24, 2015, the Executive Compensation Committee (“Committee”) of the Gannett Co., Inc. (“Company”) Board of Directors adopted a new policy to eliminate automatic accelerated vesting of equity awards to employees upon a Company change in control (“CIC”) transaction. Beginning January 1, 2016, equity awards to employees will have “double-trigger” vesting upon a CIC transaction, subject to contractual rights in effect on February 24, 2015. “Double-trigger” vesting means that a CIC will only accelerate full vesting of the awards if the awards are not continued or assumed (e.g., the awards are not equitably converted or substituted for awards of the successor company) in connection with the CIC or the recipient has a qualifying termination of employment within two years after the CIC.  

Minimum Vesting Period  

Also on February 24, 2015, the Committee adopted new vesting rules for equity awards to employees that are paid and vest solely based on service, amending the Company’s 2001 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (as amended and restated as of May 4, 2010) (the “Plan”). As a result of the amendment, beginning January 1, 2016, equity awards granted to employees that are paid and vest solely based on service will generally be subject to a minimum vesting period requiring at least one year of service. The Committee may adopt shorter vesting periods or provide for accelerated vesting after less than one year: (i) in connection with terminations of employment due to death, disability, retirement or other circumstances that the Committee determines to be appropriate; (ii) in connection with a CIC in which the award is not continued or assumed (e.g., the award is not equitably converted or substituted for an award of the successor company); (iii) for grants made in connection with an acquisition by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates in substitution for pre-existing awards; (iv) for new hire inducement awards or off-cycle awards; or (v) to comply with contractual rights in effect on February 24, 2015.  

Prohibition on Cash Buyouts of Underwater Options  

On February 24, 2015, the Committee also amended the Plan to formalize the Company’s long-standing practice of prohibiting cash buyouts of underwater stock options without shareholder approval.  

The foregoing summaries of the amendments to the Plan are subject to, and qualified by, the full text of Amendment Number 1, attached hereto as Exhibit 10-1 and incorporated herein by reference.
