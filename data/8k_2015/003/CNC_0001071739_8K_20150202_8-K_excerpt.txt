Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year

On February 2, 2015 the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Centene Corporation (the “Company”) adopted an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Company's By-Laws (the “By-Laws”) to specify that the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions involving the Company shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or certain other courts if such court lacks jurisdiction), unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum. Shareholders are deemed to have given consent to personal jurisdiction for such actions in such forum.

The Amendment does not require shareholder approval as provided for in our By-Laws, but the Company intends to submit the Amendment to the Company’s shareholders for approval at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and to repeal the Amendment if such approval is not obtained.

The foregoing is only a summary of the Amendment and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, which is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.
