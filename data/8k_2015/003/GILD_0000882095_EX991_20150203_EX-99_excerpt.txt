For 2014, antiviral product sales were $22.8 billion compared to $9.3 billion in 2013. The increase in the quarter and full year was primarily driven by sales of Sovaldi® (sofosbuvir 400 mg), which launched in December 2013 in the U.S. and in January 2014 in Europe, and Harvoni® (ledipasvir 90 mg/sofosbuvir 400 mg), which launched in the U.S. in October 2014.

Operating Expenses 

During the fourth quarter and full year 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013:

•Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses increased due to continued progression of Gilead's product pipeline, in particular in the oncology and liver disease areas, support of geographic expansion, up-front fees paid in connection with Gilead's collaboration with ONO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (ONO) and the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority review voucher. 

•Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased primarily due to Gilead's business growth, including commercial expansion related to the launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni, and Gilead's portion of the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee for which accounting guidance was finalized in the third quarter resulting in a one-time catch up of $460 million in 2014.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]Note: Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude amounts related to acquisition, restructuring, stock-based compensation and other.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

◦Positive results from several Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies evaluating investigational uses of Harvoni for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in patients with limited or no treatment options, including patients with decompensated cirrhosis, patients with HCV recurrence following a liver transplant and patients who failed previous treatment with other direct acting antivirals. 

◦Positive results from three Phase 2 open-label studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of an investigational all-oral pan-genotypic regimen containing sofosbuvir and the investigational NS5A inhibitor GS-5816 for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.

Forward-looking Statements

Statements included in this press release that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Gilead cautions readers that forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include: Gilead's ability to achieve its anticipated full year 2015 financial results; Gilead's ability to sustain growth in revenues for its antiviral, cardiovascular and respiratory programs; availability of funding for state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs); continued fluctuations in ADAP purchases driven by federal and state grant cycles which may not mirror patient demand and may cause fluctuations in Gilead's earnings; the possibility of unfavorable results from clinical trials involving RFTAF, the single tablet regimen of sofosbuvir with GS-5816 and idelalisib for new indications; Gilead's ability to initiate clinical trials in its currently anticipated timeframes; the levels of inventory held by wholesalers and retailers which may cause fluctuations in Gilead's earnings; Gilead's ability to submit NDAs for new product candidates in the timelines currently anticipated; Gilead's ability to receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all, for new and current products, including E/C/F/TAF; Gilead's ability to successfully commercialize its products, including Sovaldi, Harvoni, Stribild and Zydelig; the risk that physicians and patients may not see advantages of Gilead's products over other therapies and may therefore be reluctant to prescribe the products; the risk that estimates of patients with HCV or anticipated patient demand may not be accurate; the risk that private and public payers may demand significant discounts or rebates to include Gilead's HCV products on formulary; the risk that we may experience additional pricing pressure in light of the launch of a competitor's all oral HCV regimen in December 2014; the risk that we will be unable to advance ONO-4059; Gilead's ability to successfully develop its respiratory, cardiovascular, oncology and inflammation programs; safety and efficacy data from clinical studies may not warrant further development of Gilead's product candidates; the potential for additional austerity measures in European countries that may increase the amount of discount required on Gilead's products; fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the U.S. dollar that may cause an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact on Gilead's future revenues and pre-tax earnings; and other risks identified from time to time in Gilead's reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, Gilead makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Gilead bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. You are urged to consider statements that include the words may, will, would, could, should, might, believes, estimates, projects, potential, expects, plans, anticipates, intends, continues, forecast, designed, goal, or the negative of those words or other comparable words to be uncertain and forward-looking. Gilead directs readers to its press releases, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 and other subsequent disclosure documents filed with the SEC. Gilead claims the protection of the Safe Harbor contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements.

All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
