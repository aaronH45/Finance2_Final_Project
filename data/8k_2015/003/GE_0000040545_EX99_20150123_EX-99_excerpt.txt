  (a)   Segment revenues includes both revenues and other income related to the segment. Segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations, the portion of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and accounting changes. Segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment's management is measured – excluded in determining segment profit, which we sometimes refer to as "operating profit," for Power & Water, Oil & Gas, Energy Management, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation and Appliances & Lighting; included in determining segment profit, which we sometimes refer to as "net earnings," for GE Capital. Certain corporate costs, such as shared services, employee benefits and information technology are allocated to our segments based on usage. A portion of the remaining corporate costs are allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations. Effective in the second quarter of 2014, we began reporting our GE Capital segment results including the effects of the GECC preferred stock dividends. The cost of these dividends had previously been reported in the GE Corporate Items and Eliminations line in the Company's Summary of Operating Segments table. Presenting GE Capital segment results including the effects of the GECC preferred stock dividends aligns the way management currently measures the results of our financial services business. Prior-period information has been reclassified to be consistent with how we currently measure GE Capital.

Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP 

  We sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure. We have referred to: 

  ·   Operating earnings and operating earnings per share (EPS)     

  ·   Industrial operating earnings, GE Capital operating earnings, Industrial operating EPS and GE Capital operating EPS     

  ·   Industrial segment organic revenue growth     

  ·   GE Capital ending net investment (ENI), excluding liquidity     

  ·   Industrial cash flows from operating activities (Industrial CFOA) and Industrial CFOA excluding effects of NBCU deal-related taxes     

  ·   Oil & Gas organic revenue and profit growth     

The reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures follow.

  (a)   Earnings-per-share amounts are computed independently. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total.     

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating earnings excludes non-service-related pension costs of our principal pension plans comprising interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/losses. The service cost, prior service cost and curtailment loss components of our principal pension plans are included in operating earnings. We believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees. As such, we believe that our measure of operating earnings provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of our business. Other components of GAAP pension cost are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. Neither GAAP nor operating pension costs are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to our pension plan. We also believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding GAAP measure, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies. We believe that presenting operating earnings separately for our industrial and financial services businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company.

Organic revenue growth measures revenue excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. We also believe that presenting organic revenue growth separately for our industrial businesses provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other non-financial businesses and companies. Management recognizes that the term "organic revenue growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. Although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.

  (a)   Liquidity includes cash and equivalents and $1.2 billion of debt obligations of the U.S. Treasury at December 31, 2014.     

We use ENI to measure the size of our GE Capital segment. We believe that this measure is a useful indicator of the capital (debt or equity) required to fund a business as it adjusts for non-interest bearing current liabilities generated in the normal course of business that do not require a capital outlay. We also believe that by excluding liquidity, we provide a meaningful measure of assets requiring capital to fund our GE Capital segment as a substantial amount of liquidity resulted from debt issuances to pre-fund future debt maturities and will not be used to fund additional assets. Liquidity consists of cash and equivalents and certain debt obligations of the U.S. Treasury. As a general matter, investments included in liquidity are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. Providing this measure will help investors measure how we are performing against our previously communicated goal to reduce the size of our financial services segment. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

We refer to cash generated by our industrial businesses as "Industrial CFOA," which we define as GE's cash from continuing operating activities less the amount of dividends received by GE from GECC. This includes the effects of intercompany transactions, including GE customer receivables sold to GECC; GECC services for trade receivables management and material procurement; buildings and equipment (including automobiles) leased between GE and GECC; information technology (IT) and other services sold to GECC by GE; aircraft engines manufactured by GE that are installed on aircraft purchased by GECC from third-party producers for lease to others; and various investments, loans and allocations of GE corporate overhead costs. We believe that investors may find it useful to compare GE's operating cash flows without the effect of GECC dividends, since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from period-to-period based upon the results of the financial services businesses. We also believe that investors may find it useful to compare Industrial CFOA excluding the effects of taxes paid related to the 2013 NBCU transaction. Management recognizes that these measures may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies that contain both industrial and financial services businesses, but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the Financial Services (GECC) cash flows. We believe that our measures of Industrial CFOA and Industrial CFOA excluding NBCU deal-related taxes provide management and investors with useful measures to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flows with the operating cash flows of other non-financial businesses and companies and as such provide useful measures to supplement the reported GAAP CFOA measure.

Organic revenue and operating profit growth measure revenue and profit excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. We believe that these measures provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. Management recognizes that the terms "organic revenue growth" and "organic profit growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. Although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the Oil & Gas business and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.
