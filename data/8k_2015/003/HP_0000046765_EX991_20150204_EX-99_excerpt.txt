     U.S. Land Drilling Market Conditions Given low oil prices, drilling activity and spot pricing have significantly declined in the U.S. The total rig count reduction thus far has been more swift than many expected. Rig count reductions have been indiscriminate of rig performance and include rigs with early terminated long-term contracts. Spot pricing and activity are expected to continue to decline. Nevertheless, we still believe H&P is the best positioned drilling contractor.      

     Declining Drilling Activity in the U.S.      

     Well Positioned for Opportunities Ahead Our experience indicates that in the face of a very negative market like we see today, and a growing perception and panic of weaker-forever-prices, the market does work and eventually oil fundamentals improve. H&P has an experienced management team and seasoned field operations personnel that know how to manage through a downturn. We believe that our strategy has helped the Company to be competitive through the cycles, and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities ahead.

All of the above rig contracts include provisions for early termination fees. ** Fiscal 2015 contract coverage includes a total of 194.3 rigs that operated under term contracts during the first fiscal quarter ended 12/31/14. * **
