     General Market and Outlook Comments Low oil prices are increasingly impacting the U.S. land drilling market. Drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing are now expected to significantly decline in the U.S. Nevertheless, as was the case during the last couple cyclical down-turns, H&P is well positioned for the challenges ahead. The Company noted last month that its operational outlook for the first fiscal quarter remained unchanged; no additional clarifications are noteworthy given information available at this point.     

     H&P’s U.S. Land Activity and Pricing Comments 286 FlexRigs remain active in the U.S. Land segment. Since 12/11/14, the idle and available AC drive FlexRig count in the U.S. has increased from 15 to 26. The average FlexRig spot pricing is down by approximately 10% to begin the second fiscal quarter as compared to the average spot pricing corresponding to the first fiscal quarter. We have also received early termination notices related to four long-term contracts. Given the current trend, we expect to see another 40 to 50 FlexRigs become idle and spot pricing continue to soften during the next 30 days. We do expect additional rigs to become idle and spot pricing softness to continue beyond the next 30 days.

     Underlying U.S. Land Market Trends Unconventional plays continue to shape the landscape. AC drive rigs are in highest demand. Customers continue to focus on drilling efficiency, technology and safety. The replacement cycle is expected to continue.     

     Unconventional Plays Shaping Landscape Well Complexity is increasing: Horizontal and directional wells make up about 80% of wells drilled in the U.S. Extended reach laterals progressively longer Multi-well pad drilling gaining acceptance in more areas This all creates an expanding level of demand for FlexRigs     

     Increasing Focus on More Difficult Drilling

     Distribution of Announced New Builds Of the 89 new build FlexRigs announced since 10/1/2013, 39 are going to the Permian, 18 to the Oklahoma Woodford, 15 to the Eagle Ford, five to the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, four each to the Utica and Bakken, two to the Haynesville and one each to the Niobrara and Woodbine. 17 customers have ordered these new FlexRigs under multi-year term contracts (53 FlexRig3 rigs, 35 FlexRig5 rigs, and one FlexRig4 rig). More than two-thirds of these new FlexRigs will be equipped with hydraulic skid systems designed for multi-well pad locations.     

     The FlexRig Difference: Key Advantages Increased drilling productivity and reliability Variable frequency AC technology providing precise control and increased capability Computerized electronic driller more precisely controls down-hole parameters FlexRig designs are suited for both efficient well to well moves and multi-well pad applications Accelerated well programs and NPV gains A safer and more environmentally friendly workplace Fleet size and uniformity Total well cost savings even at premium dayrates H&P’s FlexRig Advantage Most Advanced Fleet
