Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons below are versus the fourth quarter of 2013.  

Gross Bookings, Revenue & Revenue Margins  

For the fourth quarter of 2014, gross bookings increased 24% (27% excluding foreign exchange) primarily driven by room night and air ticket growth. Room night growth was driven by Hotels.com, Brand Expedia and Travelocity. Air ticket growth was driven by Brand Expedia and Travelocity. Acquisitions added approximately 1 percentage point of inorganic bookings growth for the quarter. eLong did not have a meaningful impact on gross bookings growth in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

For the fourth quarter of 2014, domestic gross bookings increased 29% and international gross bookings increased 18% (25% excluding foreign exchange). International bookings totaled $4.9 billion, accounting for 43% of worldwide bookings versus 45% in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

For 2014, gross bookings increased 28% (29% excluding foreign exchange) primarily driven by room night and air ticket growth. Acquisitions and eLong each did not have a meaningful impact on gross bookings growth for the full year 2014. Domestic bookings increased 34% and international bookings increased 20% (22% excluding foreign exchange). International bookings totaled $20.8 billion, accounting for 41% of worldwide bookings versus 44% in the prior year. The decrease in international gross bookings mix in the fourth quarter and full year 2014 was primarily due to the inclusion of the Travelocity-branded websites, which bolstered domestic gross bookings.  

For the fourth quarter of 2014, revenue increased 18% (22% excluding foreign exchange) primarily driven by growth in hotel and advertising and media revenue. Acquisitions added approximately 1 percentage point of inorganic revenue growth for the quarter. Excluding eLong, revenue increased 19% for the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 24% and international revenue increased 11% (20% excluding foreign exchange). International revenue equaled $628 million, representing 46% of worldwide revenue versus 49% in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

For 2014, revenue increased 21% (21% excluding foreign exchange) primarily driven by growth in hotel and advertising and media revenue. Acquisitions added approximately 1 percentage point of inorganic revenue growth for the year. eLong did not have a meaningful impact on revenue growth for the full year 2014. Domestic revenue increased 21% and international revenue increased 20% (21% excluding foreign exchange). International revenue equaled $2.7 billion, representing 47% of worldwide revenue, consistent with the prior year.  

Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings (“revenue margin”) was 12.0% for the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 66 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to lower revenue per room night. For 2014, revenue margin totaled 11.4%, a decrease of 67 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower revenue per room night, partially offset by the growth in advertising and media revenue.  

Product & Services Detail – Fourth Quarter 2014  

As a percentage of total worldwide revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014, hotel accounted for 69%, advertising and media accounted for 9%, air accounted for 8% and all other revenues accounted for the remaining 14%.  

Hotel revenue increased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2014 on a 28% increase in room nights stayed driven by Hotels.com, Brand Expedia and Travelocity, partially offset by a 10% decrease in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night decreased primarily due to the efforts to expand the size and availability of the global hotel supply portfolio, promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs, as well as unfavorable book-to-stay foreign currency impact. Revenue per  

Page 2 of 17  

 room night is expected to continue to decrease in 2015. Average daily room rates (“ADRs”) were flat year-over-year for the quarter, as the positive impacts from a generally improving travel environment and a favorable geographic mix shift were offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact. ADRs are expected to be negative year-over-year in 2015 primarily due to foreign exchange.  

Air revenue increased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to a 26% increase in air tickets sold, partially offset by a 6% decrease in revenue per ticket. Advertising and media revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to continued strong growth in trivago® and Expedia® Media Solutions. All other revenue increased 23% in the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily on growth in travel insurance and car rental products.

Adjusted Selling and Marketing  

   •   For the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted selling and marketing expense increased 29% due to a $120 million increase in direct costs, including online and offline marketing expenses.

   •   Indirect costs increased $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily driven by additional personnel due to an accelerated pace of hiring in the lodging supply organization as well as a higher incentive compensation accrual. Indirect costs increased $67 million for 2014, primarily driven by the ramping up of hiring in the lodging supply organization, which is expected to continue into 2015, and additional personnel at trivago and certain of our core OTA brands, as well as a higher incentive compensation accrual. As a percentage of total selling and marketing, indirect costs represented 23% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 19% for the full year compared to 25% and 21%, respectively in the prior year. eLong did not have a meaningful impact on indirect costs as a percentage of total selling and marketing in the fourth quarter of 2014 and full year.  

Adjusted Technology and Content  

   •   For the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted technology and content expense increased 16% primarily due to a $13 million increase in personnel and overhead costs, net of capitalized salary costs, for additional personnel to support key technology projects for eLong, Brand Expedia, corporate technology function and trivago. Acquisitions contributed approximately 1 percentage point of inorganic growth to adjusted technology and content growth during the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding eLong, adjusted technology and content expense increased 14% for the fourth quarter of 2014.  

   •   For 2014, adjusted technology and content expense increased 14% primarily due to a $46 million increase in personnel and overhead costs, net of capitalized salary costs, for additional personnel to support key technology projects for Brand Expedia, eLong, the corporate technology function and trivago, as well as higher incentive compensation accrual.

Excluding eLong, adjusted general and administrative expense increased 11% for 2014.

Depreciation Expense  

For the fourth quarter of 2014 and full year, depreciation expense increased $12 million and $54 million, or 20% and 26%, respectively, primarily due to increased expenses related to previously capitalized software development costs for completed technology which has been placed into service. Depreciation expense is expected to continue to increase as additional projects are completed.  

Adjusted EBITDA  

Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by strong top line performance, offset by additional investments by eLong and higher adjusted expenses. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% for the full year 2014, primarily driven by strong top line performance. Excluding eLong, Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% and 18% for the fourth quarter and the full year 2014, respectively.  

Restructuring and Related Reorganization Charges  

In conjunction with the migration of technology platforms and centralization of technology, supply and other operations, primarily related to integrations including Wotif Group, we recognized $26 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during the fourth quarter of 2014. In 2015, we expect to recognize an additional $10-$15 million in restructuring charges with the vast majority coming in the first half of the year.  

Interest and Other  

For the fourth quarter of 2014 and full year, interest income increased $2 million and $3 million, or 32% and 10%, respectively, primarily due to higher cash and short-term investment balances. Interest expense increased $6 million and $11 million, or 29% and 12%, respectively, primarily due to higher long-term debt balances.  

For the fourth quarter of 2014, other, net was a gain of $15 million compared to a loss of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The gains for the fourth quarter of 2014 were primarily related to foreign exchange while the loss for the fourth quarter of 2013 was primarily related to an other-than-temporary investment impairment, partially offset by equity method operating gains. For 2014, other, net was a gain of $18 million compared to a loss of $3 million for 2013. The gains for full year 2014 were primarily related to income from joint ventures as well as foreign exchange while the loss for the full year 2013 was primarily related to an other-than-temporary investment impairment, partially offset by equity method operating gains. Foreign currency rate fluctuations negatively impacted fourth quarter 2014 revenue growth rates reflecting depreciation in certain foreign currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Foreign currency rate fluctuations minimally impacted full year 2014 revenue growth rates compared to the full year 2013. Our revenue hedging program is designed to offset the book-to-stay impact on merchant hotel revenue. We include any realized gains or losses from our revenue hedging program in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.  

Income Taxes  

The effective tax rate on GAAP pre-tax income was 36.0% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 19.7% for full year 2014, compared with 22.0% and 28.0%, respectively, in the prior year periods. The effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income (“ANI”) was 33.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 24.5% for full year 2014, compared with 23.4% and 24.1%, respectively, in the prior year periods. The fourth quarter variance in GAAP rates was primarily due to the tax treatment of certain 2014 losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we did not record a tax benefit, offset by nondeductible items in the fourth quarter of 2013. The full year variance in GAAP rates was primarily due to expiration of the statute of limitations for the 2001 – 2005 federal tax years and the associated release of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during 2014, as well as the absence of nondeductible items included in the prior year period. The fourth quarter variance in ANI rates was due to the tax treatment of certain 2014 losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we did not record a tax benefit. The ANI rate for the full year 2014 was essentially consistent with the prior year period.  

Balance Sheet, Cash Flows and Capitalization  

Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion and free cash flow totaled $1.0 billion. Both measures include $549 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven by an increase in deferred merchant bookings, which includes amounts related to the Travelocity strategic marketing agreement. Free cash flow increased $584 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes, higher operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization as well as lower pay-to-play tax assessment payments in the current period.  

Page 5 of 17  

In August 2014, we registered $500 million of senior unsecured notes that are due in August 2024 and bear interest at 4.5% (the “4.5% Notes”). The 4.5% Notes were issued at 99.444% of par resulting in a discount, which is being amortized over their life. Interest is payable semi-annually in February and August of each year, beginning February 15, 2015.  

Long-term debt totaled $1.75 billion at December 31, 2014 consisting of $497 million, net of discount, in 4.5% senior notes due 2024, $749 million, net of discount, in 5.95% senior notes due 2020 and $500 million in 7.456% senior notes due 2018. In addition, we have a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which was essentially untapped as of December 31, 2014.  

At December 31, 2014, we had stock-based awards outstanding representing approximately 14.8 million shares of our common stock, consisting of options to purchase approximately 14.4 million common shares with a $49.33 weighted average exercise price and weighted average remaining life of 4.1 years, and approximately 0.3 million restricted stock units (RSUs).  

During the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased 0.8 million shares of Expedia, Inc. common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $68 million excluding transaction costs (an average of $87.75 per share). In 2014, we repurchased 7.0 million shares of Expedia, Inc. common stock for approximately $537 million excluding transaction costs (an average of $76.26 per share). As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 1.8 million shares remaining under our April 2012 repurchase authorization. On February 4, 2015, the Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the Board of Directors, authorized an additional repurchase of up to 10 million shares of Expedia, Inc. common stock.  

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Governance Agreement with Liberty Interactive Corporation (“Liberty”), we issued 264,608 shares of common stock to Liberty at a price of $77.11 per share for an aggregate value of approximately $20 million. The shares were issued from treasury stock during the fourth quarter of 2014.  

On December 11, 2014, we paid a quarterly dividend of $23 million ($0.18 per common share). In addition, on February 4, 2015, the Executive Committee of Expedia’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share of outstanding common stock to be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2015, with a payment date of March 26, 2015. Based on our current shares outstanding, we estimate the total payment for this quarterly dividend will be approximately $23 million. Future declaration of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of Expedia’s Board of Directors.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures  

Expedia, Inc. reports Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Expenses (non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP selling and marketing, non-GAAP technology and content and non-GAAP general and administrative), all of which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS have certain limitations in that they do not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS also exclude certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Legal Proceedings sections, as well as the notes to the financial statements, included in the Company’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The definition of Adjusted Net Income was revised in the fourth quarters of 2010, 2011 and 2012 and the definition for Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization was revised in the fourth quarter of 2012. The definition of Adjusted Expenses was revised in the first quarter of 2014.  

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income / (loss) plus: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree; (3) certain infrequently occurring items, including restructuring; (4) items included in Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to transactional taxes (e.g. hotel and excise taxes), related to court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain transactional tax proceedings; (5) gains (losses) realized on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net; and (6) depreciation.  

The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.

Adjusted Net Income generally captures all items on the statements of operations that occur in normal course operations and have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income/(loss) attributable to Expedia, Inc. plus net of tax: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to equity plans of certain subsidiaries and equity-method investments; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets, including as part of equity-method investments, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree and (iv) gains (losses) recognized on noncontrolling investment basis adjustments when we acquire controlling interests; (3) currency gains or losses on U.S. dollar denominated cash or investments held by eLong; (4) certain other infrequently occurring items, including restructuring charges; (5) items included in Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to transactional taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy and excise taxes), related court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain transactional tax proceedings; (6) discontinued operations; (7) the noncontrolling interest impact of the aforementioned adjustment items and (8) unrealized gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors because it represents Expedia, Inc.’s combined results, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of certain expenses, infrequently occurring items and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses.  

Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by adjusted weighted average shares outstanding, which include dilution from options per the treasury stock method and include all shares relating to RSUs in shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS. This differs from the GAAP method for including RSUs, which treats them on a treasury method basis. Shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes are therefore higher than shares outstanding for GAAP EPS purposes. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, Expedia’s consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, taxes, foreign exchange gains or losses, and minority interest, but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have similar limitations as Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, Adjusted Net Income does not include all items that affect our net income / (loss) and net income / (loss) per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of operations.  

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.  

Adjusted Expenses (cost of revenue, selling and marketing, technology and content and general and administrative expenses) exclude stock-based compensation related to expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and other equity compensation under applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards as well as depreciation expense. Expedia, Inc. excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation expenses from these measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we do not believe are necessarily reflective of our ongoing cash operating expenses and cash operating income. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards, management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing management with an important tool for financial operational decision making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. Exclusion of depreciation expense also allows the year-over-year comparison of expenses on a basis that is consistent with the year-over-year comparison of Adjusted EBITDA. There are certain limitations in using financial measures that do not take into account stock-based compensation and depreciation expense, including the fact that stock-based compensation is a recurring expense and a valued part of employees’ compensation and depreciation expense is also a recurring expense and is a direct result of previous capital investment decisions made by management. Therefore it is important to evaluate both our GAAP and non-GAAP measures. See the Notes to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock-based compensation and depreciation expense by line item.
