As further described in Item 5.07 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, at the special meeting of stockholders of Iron Mountain Incorporated, or the Company, held on January 20, 2015, or the Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved the adoption of the Iron Mountain Incorporated 2014 Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, or the 2014 Plan. 

Unless the Board of Directors of the Company, or the Board, provides otherwise, the 2014 Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. The 2014 Plan permits the issuance to the employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company and its affiliates of equity-based awards, including incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, grants of shares of Common Stock, whether or not subject to restrictions, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance units, that vest based on certain performance criteria, and cash-based awards that may be earned based on certain performance criteria. 

Subject to adjustment as provided in the 2014 Plan, the total amount of shares of Common Stock reserved and available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2014 Plan is 7,750,000. The 2014 Plan permits the Company to continue to grant awards through January 20, 2025. 

Additional details of the 2014 Plan are included in the Company’s proxy statement for the Special Meeting, under the heading “Proposal Regarding the Iron Mountain Incorporated 2014 Stock and Cash Incentive Plan,” which proxy statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on December 23, 2014, or the Proxy Statement, and is available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The foregoing description of the 2014 Plan is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the 2014 Plan, which is incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference.
