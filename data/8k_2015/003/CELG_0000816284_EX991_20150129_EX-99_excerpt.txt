Net Product Sales Performance 

· REVLIMID® sales for the fourth quarter increased 16 percent to $1,322 million and were driven by increased market share and duration of therapy. Fourth quarter U.S. sales of $797 million and international sales of $525 million increased 20 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Full year REVLIMID® sales were $4,980 million, an increase of 16 percent. 

· ABRAXANE® sales for the fourth quarter were $236 million, an increase of 17 percent. U.S. sales were $172 million and international sales were $64 million, an increase of 8 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Sales of ABRAXANE® in the U.S. were positively impacted from increased use in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. Volume in Europe increased from the launch in pancreatic cancer. Full year ABRAXANE® sales were $848 million, an increase of 31 percent. 

· POMALYST®/IMNOVID® sales for the fourth quarter were $202 million. U.S. sales were $132 million and international sales were $70 million. Full year POMALYST®/IMNOVID® sales were $680 million. Sales were driven by increased market share and duration gains. 2014 was the first full year of sales after 2013 approvals in the U.S. and Europe. 

· VIDAZA® fourth quarter sales were $154 million, an 8 percent decrease year-over year. U.S. sales decreased 67 percent to $9 million impacted by the introduction of generic azacitidine in September 2013. International sales increased 3 percent to $145 million. Full year VIDAZA® sales were $612 million, a decrease of 24 percent. 

· OTEZLA® sales in the fourth quarter were $47 million. Full year OTEZLA® sales were $70 million. New and total prescriptions continue to grow for the psoriatic arthritis indication and have significantly accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2014 following the U.S. approval for psoriasis. 

2 

· In the fourth quarter, all other product sales, which include THALOMID®, ISTODAX® and an authorized generic of VIDAZA® drug product in the U.S., were $93 million compared to $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Full year sales for these products were $374 million. 

Research and Development (R&D) 

Adjusted R&D expenses were $478 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $460 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter of 2014 included $21 million in expenses for collaboration-related payments to partners and also reflected increased clinical trial activity for pipeline programs. In the fourth quarter of 2013 adjusted R&D expenses included $52 million in expenses for collaboration-related payments to partners. 

For the full year of 2014, adjusted R&D expenses were $1,651 million compared to $1,506 million for the full year of 2013. Adjusted R&D expenses included expenses related to advancing clinical trials and expenses for collaboration-related payments to partners. 

On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $585 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 versus $731 million for the same period in 2013. The year-over-year decrease in R&D expenses on a GAAP basis was primarily due to decreased upfront payments for collaboration arrangements. Full year of 2014 R&D expenses were $2,431 million for 2014 compared to $2,226 million for 2013. The increase in R&D expenses on a GAAP basis was primarily due to increased clinical trial activity and an IPR&D impairment charge, partially offset by lower upfront payments for collaboration arrangements. 

Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) 

Adjusted SG&A expenses were $479 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $400 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year of 2014, adjusted SG&A was $1,778 million versus $1,522 million in 2013. The increase was primarily due to launch expenses related to OTEZLA® in the U.S. and Europe, the ongoing launch of ABRAXANE® for pancreatic cancer in Europe and geographic expansion of the Company’s product portfolio. 

On a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses were $544 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $449 million for the same period in 2013. Full year SG&A expenses were $2,028 million for 2014 compared to $1,685 million for 2013. The increase in SG&A expenses on a GAAP basis also included increased share-based compensation expense and the settlement of a contingent obligation. 

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities 

Operations generated cash flow of $2,806 million for 2014, an increase of 26 percent compared to 2013. For the full year of 2014, Celgene purchased approximately $2,929 million of shares. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $3,140 million remaining under the existing share repurchase program. The Company ended the year with $7,547 million in cash and marketable 

3 

securities and approximately 800 million actual shares outstanding and 835 million fully diluted shares. 

Product and Pipeline Updates 

Hematology 

REVLIMID®: In December, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for continuous treatment with REVLIMID® in adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for stem cell transplantation. A submission for REVLIMID® for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently under review. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of February 22, 2015. A submission for REVLIMID® for NDMM is under review with Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and a decision on approval is expected in 2015. 

At the 2014 American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting, data were presented from a phase III trial (MDS-005) of REVLIMID® compared with placebo in patients with red-blood cell transfusion dependent low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes who were unresponsive or refractory to erythropoietin stimulating agents and did not have a deletion 5q cytogenic abnormality. A submission to the FDA is planned in 2015. The Company is engaged in discussions with regulatory authorities in other geographies to discuss possible additional regulatory submissions. 

At ASH, data were presented from a phase II randomized trial (MCL-002 SPRINT) comparing REVLIMID® with investigators’ choice of therapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and from a phase II trial (DLC-001) of REVLIMID® compared with investigators’ choice of therapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The Company will initiate enrollment in the phase III ROBUSTTM trial comparing REVLIMID® in combination with R-CHOP to placebo plus R-CHOP in newly diagnosed DLBCL in the first quarter of 2015. 

Also at the ASH meeting, data from two sub-group analyses from the phase III AML-001 trial with VIDAZA® compared with conventional care regimens in elderly subjects with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were presented. In December, a submission was made to the EMA for approval of VIDAZA® in elderly AML. An opinion from the EMA’s CHMP is expected by year-end 2015. 

Oncology 

In January, the EMA’s CHMP adopted a positive opinion for ABRAXANE® in combination with carboplatin for the first-line treatment of NSCLC in adult patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy. A decision is expected from the European Commission (EC) by the end of the first quarter of 2015. 

At the December 2014 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the German Breast Group presented results of the GeparSepto study which compared ABRAXANE® to solvent-based 

4 

paclitaxel in patients with neoadjuvant breast cancer. The Company is evaluating the data from the trial for possible future regulatory submissions. 

In December, ABRAXANE® was approved by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for use in unresectable pancreatic cancer. ABRAXANE® had previously been approved in Japan for use in metastatic gastric cancer, breast cancer and NSCLC. 

Inflammation & Immunology 

OTEZLA®: In January, the EC granted marketing authorization for OTEZLA® for two indications. One is for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who failed to respond to or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA). The second indication is for OTEZLA® alone or in combination with Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy. Additional regulatory decisions for OTEZLA® in other geographies are expected in 2015. 

In December, the phase III RELIEFTM trial (BCT-002) comparing OTEZLA® to placebo in patients with active Behçet’s disease began enrollment. Additionally, a phase II trial for OTEZLA® in ulcerative colitis was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

At the October 2014 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress, data on the long-term (52-week) efficacy and safety from the phase III ESTEEM 2 trial of OTEZLA® in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis were presented. Also at the EADV Congress, data on health-related quality of life endpoints and difficult to treat areas of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis from the phase III ESTEEM clinical program were presented. 

At the 2014 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ARHP) annual meeting, long-term (104-week) efficacy and safety data from the phase III PALACE clinical program were presented. 

GED-0301 (mongersen): At the October 2014 United European Gastroenterology Week in Vienna, Austria, data from a phase II trial of GED-0301 in patients with active Crohn’s disease were presented. A multi-trial clinical program designed to support global registrations of GED-0301 is underway. 

Sotatercept: At the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2014, interim results from an ongoing phase II study of sotatercept in patients with end stage renal disease were presented. Celgene and Acceleron are jointly developing sotatercept as part of a global collaboration.
