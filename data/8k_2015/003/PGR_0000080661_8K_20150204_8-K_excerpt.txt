Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

(e) At a meeting held on January 29, 2015, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of The Progressive Corporation (the “Company”) adopted The Progressive Corporation 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2015 Equity Incentive Plan”), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan remains subject to approval by the Company’s shareholders. If so approved, this new plan would permit the Company to provide equity-based compensation to the Company’s named executive officers and other key employees of the Company, in the following forms:

•Restricted stock units,

•Restricted stock,

•Non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options,

•Stock appreciation rights, and

•Dividend equivalents.

The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan would reserve 13 million of our common shares for issuance under the plan. This number would increase by the number of authorized shares (less 100,000) remaining available for grants under The Progressive Corporation 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”) on December 31, 2018, and by any shares covered by equity awards under the 2010 Plan that expire or are forfeited or terminate after that date. The 100,000 shares that will be left in the 2010 Plan are intended to satisfy dividend equivalent rights on awards outstanding under the 2010 Plan on December 31, 2018. All of the foregoing numbers are subject to adjustment for mergers, reorganizations, consolidations, recapitalizations, stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, spin-offs, stock rights offerings, liquidation and similar transactions. The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, by its terms, would remain in effect until January 31, 2025.

The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will be submitted to shareholders for approval at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in May 2015. Accordingly, our 2015 Proxy Statement will include a detailed summary of this plan.
