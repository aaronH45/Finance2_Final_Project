SUMMARY FINANCIAL TABLE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results for further detail of the Special Items. Special Items for 2014 are primarily related to the impairment of Little Sheep and U.S. refranchising gains. Special Items for 2013 are primarily related to the Little Sheep impairment, expenses related to the extinguishment of debt, U.S. refranchising gains and Yum! pension settlement charges. 

GREG CREED COMMENTS

Greg Creed, CEO, said “We are committed to restoring our track record of delivering at least 10% annual EPS growth year after year. I am confident we will do this in 2015 as our China business recovers and we sustain positive momentum across the rest of Yum!. Overall results in 2014 were disappointing as the Chinese supplier incident in July offset our strong first half of the year. Our top priority is to recover sales in China and capture the significant profit leverage we have in this business.

While the sales recovery in China continues to be slower than expected, we anticipate a strong second half of 2015 as the turnaround gains momentum, led by menu innovation across the year. We continue to firmly believe in the long-term potential of China and will open at least 700 new units in what remains the world’s fastest-growing economy.

Outside of China, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing across the KFC and Taco Bell divisions. We expect KFC’s strong results to sustain into 2015 as robust international performance, coupled with an improving U.S. business, drive solid sales and profit growth. At Taco Bell, the 2014 launch of breakfast and mobile ordering, combined with even more breakthrough innovation in 2015, gives us confidence as we enter the new year. Finally, while the initial relaunch of the Pizza Hut brand in the U.S. did not deliver the sales lift we expected, consumers have responded positively to the new menu and we intend to leverage this more effectively going forward.

Across Yum! we expect to open over 2,100 new international restaurants this year, further strengthening our lead in emerging markets. We remain focused on the three keys to driving shareholder value: same-store sales growth, new-unit development and generating high returns on invested capital. I'm confident that this formula will produce consistent double-digit EPS growth over the long term as we continue to build three iconic global brands that people trust and champion.”

 SPECIAL ITEMS / TAX / SHARE REPURCHASE UPDATE

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2014 and 2013 on a basis before Special Items. Special items presented below relate primarily to the impairment of certain Little Sheep assets, U.S. refranchising gains/(losses) and losses related to the extinguishment of debt in 2013. These amounts are described in (d), (e) and (f) in the accompanying notes. Other Special Items Income (Expense) in the year ended December 27, 2014 primarily includes gains from real estate sales related to our previously refranchised Mexico business. Other Special Items Income (Expense) in the quarter and year ended December 28, 2013 primarily includes YUM pension settlement charges.

The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and Special Items are not included in any of our segment results. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present results, excluding items in the quarters and years to date ended December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Consolidated Balance Sheets

and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

(a)Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year ended December 27, 2014 are preliminary.

(b)Other (income) expense for the China Division primarily consists of equity income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The quarter ended December 27, 2014 also includes a $25 million insurance recovery related to the 2012 poultry supply incident. 

(c)Previously, our reporting segments consisted of YUM Restaurants International, the United States, China and India. In the first quarter of 2014, we combined our YUM Restaurants International and United States reporting segments and began reporting this information by three new reporting segments: KFC Division, Pizza Hut Division and Taco Bell Division. China and India remain separate reporting segments. This new structure is designed to drive greater global brand focus, enabling us to more effectively share know-how and accelerate growth. While our consolidated results have not been impacted, we have restated our comparable segment information for consistent presentation.

(d)During the quarter ended December 27, 2014, we recorded an impairment charge related to Little Sheep totaling $361 million (net of income tax benefit of $76 million and amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests of $26 million). This charge was driven by a write down in trademark from $342 million to $58 million and a write off of all remaining goodwill of $160 million. The impairment charge was not allocated for segment reporting purposes and was reflected as a Special Item for certain performance measures (see accompanying reconciliation to reported results).

During the quarter ended September 7, 2013, we recorded an impairment charge related to Little Sheep totaling $258 million (net of income tax benefit of $18 million and amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests of $19 million). This charge was driven by a write down in goodwill from $384 million to $162 million and a write down in trademark from $415 million to $345 million. The impairment charge was not allocated for segment reporting purposes and was reflected as a Special Item for certain performance measures (see accompanying reconciliation to reported results).

(e)During the quarters ended December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, we recorded losses of $5 million and gains of $9 million, respectively, related to refranchising in the U.S. During the years to date ended December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, we recorded gains of $6 million and $91 million, respectively, related to refranchising in the U.S. We have traditionally not allocated refranchising (gains) losses for segment reporting purposes. Additionally, U.S. refranchising (gains) losses have been reflected as Special Items for certain performance measures (see accompanying reconciliation to reported results) consistent with our historical presentation. 

(f)During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed a cash tender offer to repurchase $550 million of our Senior Unsecured Notes due either March 2018 or November 2037. This transaction resulted in $120 million of losses, $118 million of which was classified as Interest expense, net in our Consolidated Statement of Income. The repurchase of the Senior Unsecured Notes was funded primarily by proceeds received of $599 million from the issuance of new Senior Unsecured Notes. These losses were not allocated for segment reporting purposes and were reflected as Special Items for certain performance measures (see accompanying reconciliation to reported results).
