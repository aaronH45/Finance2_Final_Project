Hale, executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer of RLJ
Lodging Trust, has been elected to the Macy's, Inc. board of directors. <br>
<br>
&quot;Leslie Hale is an accomplished executive with exceptional experience in a wide
range of financial disciplines, including corporate finance, treasury, real
estate and business development. She will be a tremendous asset to our board's
deliberations as we develop strategies to propel our company's continued
growth,&quot; said Terry J. Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. chairman and chief executive
officer. &quot;We also expect that Hale will contribute to the rich diversity of
perspectives on the Macy's, Inc. board. We are proud that our company's board
is among the most inclusive of any major corporation, and such strong
leadership from the top is important as we ensure our workforce, suppliers,
marketing and community relationships reflect the multicultural society and
marketplace we serve.&quot; <br>
<br>
The addition of Hale brings the size of Macy's, Inc.'s board of directors to 12
members. Of the 11 independent directors, six are women and four are ethnic
minorities. </font></p>

vice president for real estate and finance. </font></p>
