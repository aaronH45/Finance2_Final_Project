Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On February 10, 2015, Cerner Corporation (“Cerner”) issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the three and twelve month periods ended January 3, 2015. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and is attached hereto.

To supplement Cerner’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), Cerner uses non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Both adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related adjustments and, for 2013, a settlement charge. Cerner also discloses certain non-GAAP measures, such as bookings and backlog (which includes contract backlog and support and maintenance backlog), and the non-GAAP financial measure free cash flow (which is defined as GAAP cash flows from operating activities less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs). These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of our financial performance, and as required, are also reconciled to GAAP. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.

The information contained in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
