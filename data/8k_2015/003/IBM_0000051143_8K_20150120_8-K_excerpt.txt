Total revenues from continuing operations for the fourth-quarter of 2014 of $24.1 billion were down 12 percent (down 2 percent, adjusting for the impact of the divested customer care outsourcing and System x businesses and for currency) from the fourth-quarter of 2013 and were down 1 percent for the full year 2014, adjusting for the impact of the divested businesses and for currency. 

“We are making significant progress in our transformation, continuing to shift IBM’s business to higher value, and investing and positioning ourselves for the longer term,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. 

“In 2014, we repositioned our hardware portfolio for higher value, maintained a services backlog of $128 billion and achieved strong revenue growth across cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security. Together these strategic imperatives grew 16 percent in 2014 and now represent $25 billion and 27 percent of our revenue.”

Global Business Services pre-tax income decreased 22 percent and pre-tax margin decreased to 16.4 percent. Pre-tax income and margin include the impact of the fourth-quarter workforce rebalancing charge. 

The estimated services backlog at December 31, 2014 was $128 billion, flat year to year adjusting for the divested customer care outsourcing and System x businesses and currency. 

Software 

Revenues from the Software segment were $7.6 billion, down 7 percent (down 3 percent, adjusting for currency) compared with the fourth-quarter of 2013. Software pre-tax income decreased 11 percent and pre-tax margin decreased to 44.7 percent. Pre-tax income and margin include the impact of the fourth-quarter workforce rebalancing charge.

Global Financing segment revenues were flat (up 5 percent, adjusting for currency) in the fourth-quarter to $532 million. Pre-tax income for the segment decreased 11 percent to $526 million. 

Hardware 

Revenues from continuing operations for the Systems and Technology segment totaled $2.4 billion for the quarter, down 39 percent (down 12 percent, adjusting for the impact of the divested System x business and currency) from the fourth-quarter of 2013.

Total operating (non-GAAP) gross profit margin from continuing operations was 53.9 percent in the 2014 fourth-quarter compared with 53.3 percent in the 2013 fourth-quarter period. 

Expense 

Total reported expense and other income from continuing operations declined 20 percent to $5.8 billion compared with the prior year period. The reported reduction was driven by the gain of $1.4 billion ($1.1 billion pre-tax income benefit, net of related transaction and performance-based costs) from the divestiture of the System x business and the elimination of the expense for the System x business from the company’s run rate. Without these items, expense and other income would have been up approximately 2 percent. S,G&A expense of $6.0 billion was up 1 percent from the prior-year period and includes the workforce rebalancing charge of approximately $580 million. R,D&E expense of $1.3 billion decreased 9 percent compared with the year-ago period, reflecting the divestiture of the System x business and currency impact. Intellectual property and custom development income decreased to $199 million compared with $201 million a year ago. Other (income) and expense was income of $1.5 billion, including the gain from the divested System x business, compared with prior-year income of $116 million. Interest expense increased to $117 million compared with $113 million in the prior-year period. 

Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other income from continuing operations decreased 20 percent to $5.6 billion compared with the prior-year period, including 

the gain from the divestiture of the System x business. Operating (non-GAAP) S,G&A expense increased 1 percent to $5.8 billion compared with the prior-year period and includes the workforce rebalancing charge. Operating (non-GAAP) R,D&E expense of $1.3 billion was down 7 percent compared with the year-ago period, reflecting the divestiture of the System x business and currency impact. 

Pre-Tax Income 

Pre-tax income from continuing operations was flat year over year at $7.1 billion; pre-tax margin of 29.4 percent was up 3.5 points compared with the prior-year period. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations decreased 2 percent to $7.4 billion and pre-tax margin was 30.7 percent, up 3.0 points, compared to the year-ago period. 

*** 

IBM’s tax rate from continuing operations was 22.3 percent, up 9.8 points year over year; operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was 21.8 percent, up 9.6 points compared to the year-ago period. The change in the fourth-quarter tax rate is driven by prior year discrete tax items, including benefits from tax audit settlements. 

Net income margin from continuing operations increased 0.2 points to 22.9 percent. Total operating (non-GAAP) net income margin from continuing operations decreased 0.3 points to 24.0 percent. 

The weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding in the fourth-quarter 2014 was 995 million, a decrease of 8 percent compared with the same period of 2013. As of December 31, 2014, there were 991 million basic common shares outstanding. 

Debt, including Global Financing, totaled $40.8 billion, compared with $39.7 billion at year-end 2013, and down $4.9 billion from the third quarter of 2014. From a management segment view, Global Financing debt totaled $29.1 billion versus $27.5 billion at year-end 2013, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 7.2 to 1. Core (non-global financing) debt totaled $11.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion since year-end 2013, resulting in a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 59 percent, which includes impacts from retirement plan remeasurement that take into account changes in discount rates and recently released U.S. mortality tables, the announced Microelectronics business divestiture and foreign exchange translation. 

IBM ended the fourth-quarter 2014 with $8.5 billion of cash on hand and generated free cash flow of $6.6 billion, excluding Global Financing receivables, down approximately $1.8 billion year over year. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $1.1 billion in dividends and $0.1 billion of gross share repurchases. 

At the end of December 2014, IBM had approximately $6.3 billion remaining from the current share repurchase authorization. 

Full-Year 2014 Results

The charge also includes other estimated costs related to the transaction, including cash consideration expected to be transferred to GLOBALFOUNDRIES of approximately $1.5 billion. 

Operating (non-GAAP) net income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was $16.7 billion compared with $18.4 billion in the year-ago period, a decrease of 9 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $16.53 compared with $16.64 per diluted share for the 2013 period, a decrease of less than 1 percent.

  s   27 27 Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors. Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items Management presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term "operating" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management’s calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Overall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company’s pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company’s segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company’s management and measurement system. Constant Currency Management refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period’s currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. Supplemental Materials      

     Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials Cash Flow Management uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company’s operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company’s ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Debt-to-Capital Ratio Management presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1. Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company’s core business operations. Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture On September 10, 2013, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with SYNNEX for the sale of IBM’s worldwide customer care process outsourcing services business and on January 23, 2014, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Lenovo for the sale of IBM’s x86 server business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the customer care process outsourcing services business and/or the x86 server business divestitures. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors. www.ibm.com/investor28 Supplemental Materials
