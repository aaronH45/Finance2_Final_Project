We present Aggregates segment gross profit margin as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is more meaningful to our investors as it excludes related transportation revenues (a pass-through activity) and other service-related revenues, such as landfill tipping fees. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: Change in gross profit margin as a percentage of freight- adjusted revenues Gross profit for 2014 acquisitions Gross profit excluding 2014 acquisitions Freight-adjusted revenues for 2014 acquisitions Appendix - Reconciliation of Non - GAAP Financial Measures"
