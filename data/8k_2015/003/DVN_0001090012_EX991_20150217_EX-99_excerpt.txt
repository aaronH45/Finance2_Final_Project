NEWS RELEASE  

Devon Energy Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2014 Results; Provides 2015 Capital and Production Outlook  

   •   Achieved record Q4 oil production exceeding company guidance  

   •   Generated U.S. oil production growth of 82 percent in Q4 year over year  

   •   Increased proved oil reserves to highest level in company history  

   •   Maintained excellent financial strength and liquidity  

   •   Reiterated 2015 oil production growth outlook of 20 to 25 percent  

   •   Decreased 2015 E&P capital budget by 20 percent  

OKLAHOMA CITY – Feb. 17, 2015 – Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) today reported net earnings for the full-year 2014 of $1.6 billion, or $3.93 per common share ($3.91 per diluted share). This compares to a net loss of $20 million in 2013, or $0.06 per common share ($0.06 per diluted share).  

Devon generated cash flow from operations of $6.0 billion in 2014, a 10 percent increase compared to 2013. Including $5.1 billion of cash received from the sale of non-core assets, the company’s total cash inflows for the year exceeded $11 billion.  

For the fourth quarter of 2014, Devon’s core earnings totaled $343 million, or $0.84 per common share ($0.83 per diluted share). The company reported a net loss of $408 million, or $1.01 per common share ($1.01 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter.  

“Devon delivered another exceptional performance in the fourth quarter, rounding out an outstanding year for the company, including a significant repositioning of the portfolio,” said John Richels, president and CEO. “Production from our top-tier asset portfolio exceeded guidance for all products, proved oil reserves reached a record level and our midstream business increased profitability to an all-time high.  

“We expect to sustain operational momentum in 2015 with the significant improvements we have seen in our completion designs and a capital program focused on development drilling,” said Richels. “With strong results from our enhanced completions and a focus on core development areas, we expect growth in oil production to be between 20 and 25 percent in 2015, even with a projected reduction of approximately 20 percent in E&P capital spending compared to 2014.”  

Repositioned Portfolio Exceeds Production Expectations  

Total production from Devon’s retained assets averaged 664,000 oil-equivalent barrels (Boe) per day during the fourth quarter of 2014. This result exceeded the company’s guidance range by 9,000 Boe per day and represents a 20 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. This high-margin growth increased liquids production to 57 percent of the company’s retained asset mix in the fourth quarter.  

Devon also delivered record oil production of 239,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. This result exceeded the top end of the company’s guidance range and represents a 48 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The most significant growth came from the company’s U.S. operations, where oil production increased a substantial 82 percent for the quarter year over year.  

The strong growth in U.S. oil production during the quarter was largely attributable to prolific well results from the company’s world-class Eagle Ford assets. Net production in the Eagle Ford averaged 98,000 Boe per day in the fourth quarter, a 100 percent increase compared to Devon’s first month of ownership in March 2014. The company also achieved another quarter of strong production growth in  

 the Permian Basin. Led by outstanding results from Devon’s Delaware Basin assets, total Permian Basin production increased to 98,000 Boe per day in the fourth quarter, a 14 percent increase compared to the year-ago period.  

In Canada, net oil production from the company’s heavy-oil projects increased to a record high of 93,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. This strong result exceeded the top end of Devon’s guidance range by 5,000 barrels per day and represents a 15 percent increase in production compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. This growth was driven by the continued ramp-up of the company’s newest heavy-oil facility, Jackfish 3, which exited the year averaging 13,000 barrels per day.  

Reserves from Retained Assets Grow; Oil Reserves Climb to Record Levels  

Devon’s estimated proved reserves totaled 2.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels on Dec. 31, 2014, a 7 percent increase in reserves compared to the company’s retained asset portfolio in 2013. At year-end, proved oil reserves reached a record 895 million barrels.  

The most significant reserve growth came from Devon’s U.S. operations, where oil reserves from retained properties increased 65 percent year over year to 351 million barrels. The substantial growth in U.S. oil reserves is largely attributable to the company’s Eagle Ford acquisition and its Delaware Basin operations. During the year, the company’s U.S. drilling programs added 94 million barrels of light-oil reserves through successful drilling (extensions and discoveries). This represents a replacement rate of approximately 200 percent of the light oil produced during 2014.  

Overall, the company’s reserve life index (proved reserves divided by annual production from retained properties) remained at approximately 12 years, and its proved undeveloped reserves accounted for only 25 percent of proved reserves.  

Operations Report  

For additional details on Devon’s core and emerging assets, please refer to the company’s fourth-quarter 2014 Operations Report at www.devonenergy.com. Highlights from the operations report include:  

   •   Prolific Q4 results, increasing type curve for Eagle Ford  

   •   Improved completion design delivers excellent results in Delaware Basin  

   •   Ramp-up exceeds expectations at Jackfish 3  

   •   High-rate development wells from Cana-Woodford  

Upstream Revenue Increases 16 Percent; Midstream Profit Rises  

Revenue from oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids sales totaled $9.9 billion in 2014, a 16 percent increase compared to 2013. The growth in revenue was attributable to the company’s significant increase in U.S. light-oil production. This high-margin growth increased oil sales to 60 percent of Devon’s total upstream revenues during the year.  

In the fourth quarter, upstream revenue was $2.1 billion, a 3 percent decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Cash settlements related to the company’s oil and natural gas hedges increased revenue by $4.23 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offsetting lower realized oil and natural gas liquids prices. At Dec. 31, 2014, Devon’s attractive commodity hedges had a fair market value of nearly $2.0 billion.  

The company’s marketing and midstream business also delivered excellent results in 2014, with operating profits reaching an all-time high of $852 million, a 66 percent increase compared to 2013. The year-over-year increase in operating profit was largely driven by growth from EnLink Midstream.

Cash Operating Costs Decline  

The company’s successful cost containment efforts resulted in lease operating expenses (LOE), the largest cash cost, of $9.29 per Boe in the fourth quarter. LOE was 5 percent below the low end of Devon’s guidance range and 2 percent lower than the third quarter of 2014. The company’s significant scale in core plays coupled with a consistent focus on efficient operations continues to position Devon as a low-cost producer.  

Production and property taxes were $108 million in the quarter, essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Compared to the previous quarter, lower commodity prices drove a decline in production and property taxes of 23 percent.  

Net financing costs totaled $167 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 50 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. The higher financing costs were due to a $48 million charge attributable to the early redemption of $1.9 billion in senior notes.  

General and administrative expenses totaled $252 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This compares with $157 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The year-over-year increase resulted from the consolidation of EnLink Midstream and higher employee-related costs.  

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) amounted to $14.89 per Boe in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, DD&A was $13.51 per Boe and compares to a rate of $10.99 in 2013. The increase in DD&A rate was primarily attributable to the company’s Eagle Ford acquisition and EnLink Midstream transaction.  

Devon incurred a $1.9 billion non-cash impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2014. The goodwill was recorded more than a decade ago and was related to an acquisition comprised almost entirely of conventional gas assets in Canada that Devon no longer owns. This non-cash impairment was related to the recent drop in oil prices.  

Full-year 2014 income tax expense was $2.4 billion, or 58 percent of pre-tax earnings. This unusually high tax rate resulted principally from the goodwill impairment charge that lowered pre-tax earnings but did not impact the company’s full-year tax obligations. Excluding this impairment charge and other non-recurring items, Devon’s income tax rate was 35 percent of adjusted pre-tax earnings for the full year.  

Balance Sheet and Liquidity Remain Strong  

Devon’s financial position remains exceptionally strong with investment-grade credit ratings and cash balances of $1.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During the quarter, the company redeemed $1.9 billion in senior notes, completing the debt repayment plan associated with its portfolio transformation. At Dec. 31, the company’s net debt, excluding non-recourse EnLink obligations, totaled $7.8 billion.  

2015 Outlook: Production Guidance Unchanged; E&P Capital Reduced 20 Percent  

Detailed forward-looking guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2015 is provided later in the release. A notable component of this outlook is Devon’s 2015 E&P capital budget of $4.1 to $4.4 billion. This level of investment implies around a 20 percent decline in E&P spending compared to 2014 and is designed to better balance capital expenditures with expected cash inflows.  

Even with reduced E&P capital investment in 2015, the company’s production growth outlook remains unchanged. With significant improvements in completion design and a capital program focused on development drilling, Devon expects to deliver oil production growth of 20 to 25 percent year over year on a retained property basis. This production outlook is driven by balanced oil growth in both the U.S. and Canada.
