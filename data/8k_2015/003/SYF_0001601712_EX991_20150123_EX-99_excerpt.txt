Business and Financial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of 2014

All comparisons below are for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, unless otherwise noted.

Earnings

•Net interest income increased $129 million, or 5%, to $3.0 billion, driven by strong loan receivables growth, partially offset by higher interest expense from funding completed to increase liquidity in 2014.

•Total platform revenue increased $216 million, or 9% ($170 million, or 7%, excluding the pre-tax gain associated with portfolio sales).

•Provision for loan losses decreased $21 million, or 3%, to $797 million.

•Other income increased $32 million driven primarily by a $46 million gain associated with portfolio sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. The gain was partially offset by increased loyalty and rewards costs associated with program initiatives.

•Other expense decreased $15 million, or 2%, to $792 million due to charges in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to certain regulatory matters, partially offset by increased investments in growth and infrastructure build in preparation for separation from General Electric Company (GE).

•Net earnings totaled $531 million for the quarter compared to $443 million, including a $29 million after-tax gain associated with the portfolio sales.

Balance Sheet

•Period-end loan receivables growth remained strong at 7% driven by purchase volume growth of 11% and average active account growth of 6%.

•The composition of loan receivables growth remained broad-based across all sales platforms.

•Deposits grew to $35 billion, up $9 billion, or 36%, from the fourth quarter of 2013, and now comprise 56% of funding sources compared to 51% at the end of 2013.

Key Financial Metrics
