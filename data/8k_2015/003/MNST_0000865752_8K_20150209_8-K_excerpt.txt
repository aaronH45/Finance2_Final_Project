Item 8.01. Other Events. 

As previously disclosed in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 18, 2014, Monster Beverage Corporation (the “Company”) entered into definitive agreements providing for a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category with The Coca-Cola Company (“Coca-Cola”). These agreements provided for, among other things, the amendment of the Company’s existing distribution coordination agreements with Coca-Cola at the closing of the transactions. 

The amended distribution coordination agreements to be entered into with Coca-Cola will provide for the transition of third parties’ rights to distribute the Company’s products in most territories in the U.S. and Canada to members of Coca-Cola’s distribution network, which consists of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottling/distribution partners. In accordance with its existing agreements with the applicable third-party distributors, on February 9, 2015, the Company sent notices of termination to certain affected third-party distributors providing for the termination of their respective distribution agreements, to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights will be transitioned to Coca-Cola’s distribution network in each applicable territory as of the effective date of the termination of the applicable third party’s rights in such territory. 

The Company expects to incur costs associated with the transition of its distribution arrangements in an amount currently estimated to be $280.0 million.
