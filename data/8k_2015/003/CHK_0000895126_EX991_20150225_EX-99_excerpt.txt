CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION REPORTS FINANCIAL AND

OPERATIONAL RESULTS FOR THE 2014 FULL YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER; ANNOUNCES 2015 TOTAL PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 

OKLAHOMA CITY, February 25, 2015 – Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today reported financial and operational results for the 2014 full year and fourth quarter and announced details of its 2015 Outlook and capital expenditure program. Highlights include:

•2014 adjusted net income of $1.49 per fully diluted share and 2014 adjusted ebitda of $4.945 billion [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Planned 2015 total capital expenditures ranging from $4.0 to $4.5 billion

•Projected 2015 production growth of 3 – 5%, adjusted for asset sales

Doug Lawler, Chesapeake’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “2014 was a year of accomplishments for Chesapeake. Because of these accomplishments and the progress we have made as a company in 2014, Chesapeake is well positioned to remain strong and flexible in 2015. We have taken and continue to take appropriate steps not only to weather the current difficult commodity price environment we face today, but to thrive in it. Chesapeake became a much stronger company in 2014, and we are looking forward to becoming even stronger in 2015.”

2015 Capital Program and Production Outlook

Chesapeake is budgeting total capital expenditures (including capitalized interest) of $4.0 – $4.5 billion for 2015. Using the midpoint of the range, this represents a 26% reduction from the company's 2014 capital expenditures before acquisitions of $5.8 billion, and a 37% reduction from the company’s 2014 total capital expenditures of approximately $6.7 billion (reconciled in the "Capital Spending and Cost Overview" section below). The company is targeting 2015 production of 235 – 240 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), or average daily production of 645 – 655 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (mboe), which represents 3 – 5% production growth after adjusting for 2014 asset sales. Of the 2015 projected production, approximately 39 – 40 mmboe is estimated to be crude oil, 1,035 – 1,055 billion cubic feet (bcf) natural gas and 23 – 24 mmboe natural gas liquids (NGL).

Chesapeake plans to operate 35 – 45 rigs in 2015, which represents the company's lowest operated rig activity level since 2004 and a decrease of approximately 38% (using the midpoint of the range) from an average of 64 rigs in 2014. The company intends to spud approximately 790 gross operated wells and connect to sales approximately 800 gross operated wells in 2015, a decrease from approximately 1,175 and 1,150 wells, respectively, in 2014. The table below compares the capital and rig counts allocated to the company’s operating areas for 2015 and 2014:

2014 Full-Year Results

For the 2014 full year, Chesapeake reported net income available to common stockholders of $1.273 billion, or $1.87 per fully diluted share. Items typically excluded by securities analysts in their earnings estimates increased net income available to common stockholders for the 2014 full year by approximately $316 million and are presented on Page 14 of this release. The primary component of this increase was unrealized gains on the company's oil and natural gas commodity derivatives, partially offset by the redemption of all the outstanding preferred shares of a subsidiary. Adjusting for these items, 2014 full-year adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $957 million, or $1.49 per fully diluted share, compared to adjusted net income available to common stockholders of $965 million, or $1.50 per fully diluted share, in the 2013 full year. 

Adjusted ebitda was $4.945 billion for the 2014 full year, compared to $5.016 billion for the 2013 full year. Operating cash flow, which is defined as cash flow provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities, was $5.026 billion for the 2014 full year, compared to $4.958 billion for the 2013 full year. 

Adjusted net income available to common stockholders, operating cash flow, ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are provided on pages 13 – 17 of this release. 

Chesapeake’s daily production for the 2014 full year averaged 706,300 barrels of oil equivalent (boe), a year-over-year increase of 9%, adjusted for asset sales. Average daily production consisted of approximately 115,800 barrels (bbls) of oil, 3.0 bcf of natural gas and 90,500 bbls of NGL. Adjusted for asset sales, 2014 full-year average daily oil production increased 7%, average daily natural gas production increased 6% and average daily NGL production increased 42%.

2014 Fourth Quarter Results

For the 2014 fourth quarter, Chesapeake reported net income available to common stockholders of $586 million, or $0.81 per fully diluted share. Items typically excluded by securities analysts in their earnings 

2

estimates increased 2014 fourth quarter net income by approximately $552 million on an after-tax basis. The primary component of this increase was unrealized gains on oil and natural gas commodity derivatives. Adjusting for these items, 2014 fourth quarter net income available to common stockholders was $34 million, or $0.11 per fully diluted share, which compares to adjusted net income available to common stockholders of $161 million, or $0.27 per fully diluted share, in the 2013 fourth quarter.

For the 2014 fourth quarter, Chesapeake reported adjusted ebitda of $916 million, compared to $1.132 billion in the 2013 fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was $873 million in the 2014 fourth quarter, compared to $995 million in the 2013 fourth quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decreases in adjusted ebitda and operating cash flow were primarily the result of lower realized oil, natural gas and NGL prices, partially offset by higher production volumes.

Chesapeake’s daily production for the 2014 fourth quarter averaged approximately 729,000 boe, a year-over-year increase of 12%, adjusted for asset sales. Average daily production in the 2014 fourth quarter consisted of approximately 121,200 bbls of oil, 3.1 bcf of natural gas and 97,600 bbls of NGL, which represent year-over-year increases of 7%, 9% and 40% respectively, adjusted for asset sales.

Strategic Transactions and Asset Sales Update

In the 2014 fourth quarter, the company received approximately $5.1 billion of net proceeds from asset sales, most of which was from the sale of certain assets in the southern Marcellus Shale and a portion of the eastern Utica Shale assets that closed in December 2014. Also in the 2014 fourth quarter, the company entered into a new five-year $4.0 billion senior unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility. The new unsecured facility has investment grade-like terms and allowed Chesapeake to release nearly $6.0 billion of proved reserve-based collateral.

Capital Spending and Cost Overview

Chesapeake’s drilling and completion capital expenditures during the 2014 full year were approximately $4.5 billion, and capital expenditures for the acquisition of unproved properties, geological and geophysical costs, and other property, plant and equipment were approximately $669 million, for a total of approximately $5.1 billion, compared to the company’s forecasted range of $5.0 – $5.4 billion. In addition, during 2014 the company invested approximately $499 million to repurchase leased rigs and compressors as part of its strategic initiative to reduce complexity and future commitments, as well as to facilitate asset sales and the spin-off of its oilfield services business. The company also invested approximately $450 million as part of an exchange of properties in the Powder River Basin. Total capital investments, including capitalized interest of $637 million, were approximately $6.7 billion in 2014, compared to approximately $7.8 billion in 2013, and is reconciled below. Chesapeake’s total capital expenditures were approximately $1.8 billion in the 2014 fourth quarter compared to approximately $2.1 billion in the 2013 fourth quarter. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Chesapeake spud a total of 308 gross wells and connected 311 gross wells to sales during the 2014 fourth quarter, compared to 239 gross wells spud and 260 gross wells connected to sales during the 2014 third quarter.

Chesapeake's focus on cost discipline continued to generate reductions in costs associated with production and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. Average production expenses during the 2014 full year 

3

were $4.69 per boe, a decrease of 1% year over year. G&A expenses (including stock-based compensation) during the 2014 full year were $1.25 per boe, a decrease of 33% year over year.

Average production expenses during the 2014 fourth quarter were $5.07, an increase of 10% from the 2013 fourth quarter. G&A expenses (including stock-based compensation) during the 2014 fourth quarter were $1.38 per boe, a decrease of 30% from the 2013 fourth quarter. 

A summary of the company’s guidance for 2015 is provided in the Outlook dated February 25, 2015, attached to this release as Schedule "A” beginning on Page 18.

Total Proved Reserves 

The company's December 31, 2014 proved reserves were 2.469 billion boe, an increase of 5% compared to year-end 2013 before acquisitions and divestitures. In 2014, Chesapeake increased its proved reserves by 448 mmboe for extensions and discoveries and 14 mmboe from acquisitions. The additions were offset by 362 mmboe as the result of divestitures, 51 mmboe of net negative reserve revisions and production of 258 mmboe. Chesapeake's proved developed reserves as a percentage of total proved reserves increased to 75% as of December 31, 2014, compared to 68% as of December 31, 2013.

Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) is the second-largest producer of natural gas and the 11th largest producer of oil and natural gas liquids in the U.S. Headquartered in Oklahoma City, the company's operations are focused on discovering and developing its large and geographically diverse resource base of unconventional oil and natural gas assets onshore in the U.S. The company also owns substantial marketing and compression businesses. Further information is available at www.chk.com where Chesapeake routinely posts announcements, updates, events, investor information, presentations and news releases.

This news release and the accompanying Outlook include "forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are statements other than statements of historical fact. They include statements that give our current expectations or forecasts of future events, production, production growth and well connection forecasts, estimates of operating costs, planned development drilling and expected drilling cost reductions, capital expenditures, expected efficiency gains, anticipated asset sales and proceeds to be received therefrom, projected cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations, and the assumptions on which such statements are based. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate or changed assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include those described under "Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in Chesapeake's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K (available at http://www.chk.com/investors/sec-filings). These risk factors include the volatility of oil, natural gas and NGL prices; write-downs of our oil and natural gas carrying values due to declines in prices; the availability of operating cash flow and other funds to finance reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; our ability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; commodity derivative activities resulting in lower prices realized on oil, natural gas and NGL sales; the need to secure derivative liabilities and the inability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations; adverse developments or losses from pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings, including royalty claims; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; charges incurred in response to market conditions and in connection with actions to reduce financial leverage and complexity; drilling and operating risks and resulting liabilities; effects of environmental protection laws and regulation on our business; legislative and regulatory initiatives further regulating hydraulic fracturing; our need to secure adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations and to dispose of or recycle the water used; federal and state tax proposals affecting our industry; potential OTC derivatives regulation limiting our ability to hedge against commodity price fluctuations; impacts of potential legislative and regulatory actions addressing climate change; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry; a deterioration in general economic, business or industry conditions; negative public perceptions of our industry; limited control over properties we do not operate; pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and transportation interruptions; cyber attacks adversely impacting our operations; and interruption in operations at our headquarters due to a catastrophic event.

In addition, disclosures concerning the estimated contribution of derivative contracts to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Our production forecasts are also dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity. Expected asset sales may not be completed in the time frame anticipated or at all. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this news release, and we undertake no obligation to update any of the information provided in this release or the accompanying Outlook, except as required by applicable law.

(a)Reserve volumes and PV-10 value estimated using SEC reserve recognition standards and pricing assumptions based on the trailing 12-month average first-day-of-the-month prices as of December 31, 2014 of $4.35 per mcf of natural gas and $94.98 per bbl of oil, before field differential adjustments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

PV-10 is discounted (at 10%) future net cash flows before income taxes. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows includes the effects of estimated future income tax expenses and is calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932. Management uses PV-10 as one measure of the value of the company's current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. We also understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in similar ways. While PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors which are consistent from company to company, the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company.

The company’s PV-10 and standardized measure were calculated using the following prices, before field differentials: $4.35 per mcf of natural gas and $94.98 per bbl of oil as of December 31, 2014 and $3.67 per mcf of natural gas and $96.82 per bbl of oil as of December 31, 2013, before field differential adjustments.

(a)Realized gains and losses include the following items: (i) settlements of nondesignated derivatives related to current period production revenues, (ii) prior period settlements for option premiums and for early-terminated derivatives originally scheduled to settle against current period production revenues, and (iii) gains and losses related to de-designated cash flow hedges originally designated to settle against current period production revenues. Unrealized gains and losses include the change in fair value of open derivatives scheduled to settle against future period production revenues offset by amounts reclassified as realized gains and losses during the period. Although we no longer designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, we believe these definitions are useful to management and investors in determining the effectiveness of our price risk management program.

(b)Net of amounts capitalized.

(c)Realized (gains) losses include settlements related to the current period interest accrual and the effect of (gains) losses on early termination trades. Unrealized (gains) losses include changes in the fair value of open interest rate derivatives offset by amounts reclassified to realized (gains) losses during the period.

(a)All adjustments to net income available to common stockholders reflected net of tax other than the redemption of preferred shares of a subsidiary. 

(b)Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share assuming dilution are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common stockholders or diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share assuming dilution exclude certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results. The company believes these adjusted financial measures are a useful adjunct to earnings calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) because:

(i)Management uses adjusted net income available to common stockholders to evaluate the company's operational trends and performance relative to other oil and natural gas producing companies.

(ii)Adjusted net income available to common stockholders is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.

(iii)Items excluded generally are one-time items or items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, any guidance provided by the company generally excludes information regarding these types of items.

(c)Weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding include shares that were considered antidilutive for calculating earnings per share in accordance with GAAP.

(a)Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities. Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under GAAP. Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and natural gas company's ability to generate cash that is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.

(b)Ebitda represents net income before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Ebitda is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business. We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Ebitda is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreements and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreements. Ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations or cash flow provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.
