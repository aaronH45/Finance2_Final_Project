For seven consecutive years, Concho has increased total production, oil production and cash flow while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. Our results in 2014 reflect the quality of our assets in the Permian Basin and the technical and execution strength of our team. By optimizing our drilling and completion techniques, we are not only improving recoveries, we are also enhancing the rates of return of our projects, yielding a more capital efficient program. Despite the challenging commodity price environment, Concho is in a strong position to further increase value for our shareholders as we focus on executing a disciplined, returns-based capital program.”

 Texas Permian  

 Concho’s horizontal well results in the fourth quarter of 2014 reflect the significant improvements the Company has made in optimizing development in the Midland Basin. Throughout 2014, the Company targeted longer laterals while refining its completion method. Concho added 15 new horizontal wells with at least 30 days of production as of December 31, 2014, with an average lateral length of 5,835 feet.

 New Mexico Shelf

In the fourth quarter of 2014, Concho added 13 new horizontal wells targeting the Yeso formation with at least 30 days of production as of December 31, 2014. The average peak 30-day and 24-hour rates for these wells were 408 Boepd (83% oil) and 585 Boepd, respectively, with average well costs ranging from $3.0 million to $4.0 million.  

 Fourth-Quarter 2014 Financial Summary  

 Net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $129.9 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared with net income of $105.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding non-cash and unusual items, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $99.7 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $95.3 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2013.  

 Fourth quarter of 2014 non-cash and unusual items included a $765.0 million gain on derivatives and a $98.2 million in cash receipts from derivatives. Non-cash and unusual items for the quarter also included impairment and leasehold abandonment charges of $431.7 million and $197.6 million, respectively, primarily due to the significant decline in the crude oil and natural gas futures curves and for certain non-core assets that the Company does not intend to develop in the current environment.  

 EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter of 2014 totaled $509.6 million, an increase of 10% over the fourth quarter of 2013.  

 The Company’s total realized price during the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding the effect of commodity derivatives, was $51.77 per Boe, compared with $70.82 per Boe during the fourth quarter of 2013. The lower total realized price in the 2014 period reflects a sharply lower crude oil price.  

 Full-Year 2014 Financial Summary

 EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for 2014 totaled $2.0 billion, an increase of 21% over 2013.  

 The Company’s total realized price for full-year 2014, excluding the effect of commodity derivatives, was $65.08 per Boe, compared with $68.97 per Boe in 2013.  

 Costs incurred for 2014 were approximately $2.6 billion for exploration and development activities and approximately $390 million for property acquisitions. During 2014, the Company expanded its Permian Basin acreage position by approximately 68,500 net acres. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s Permian Basin acreage position totaled approximately 1.1 million gross (700,000 net) acres.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements.

 EBITDAX  

 EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein, and reconciled from the generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities.  

 The Company defines EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration and abandonments expense, (2) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, (3) accretion expense, (4) impairments of long-lived assets (5) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (6) (gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges, (7) cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges, (8) (gain) loss on disposition of assets, net, (9) interest expense, (10) loss on extinguishment of debt, (11) federal and state income taxes on continuing operations and (12) similar items listed above that are presented in discontinued operations. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP.  

 The Company’s EBITDAX measure (which includes continuing and discontinued operations) provides additional information which may be used to better understand the Company’s operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDAX. EBITDAX, as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by the Company’s management team, and by other users, of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess the Company’s operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of the Company’s assets and the Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.
