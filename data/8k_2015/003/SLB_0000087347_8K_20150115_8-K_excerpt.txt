Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

The Full-Year and Fourth-Quarter 2014 Results Press Release and Supplemental Information furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02, was posted on the Schlumberger internet website (www.slb.com/ir) on January 15, 2015. In accordance with General Instructions B.2. of Form 8-K, the information will not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor will it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.  

In addition to financial results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that are included in the Full-Year and Fourth-Quarter 2014 Results Press Release and Supplemental Information, the document also includes the following non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under Regulation G of the Exchange Act):  

   •   Net Debt: Net Debt represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.  

   •   Income from continuing operations attributable to Schlumberger, excluding charges and credits diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits; and effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits: Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from the foregoing financial measures enables it to evaluate more effectively Schlumberger’s operations period over period and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked by the excluded items.  

   •   Free cash flow: Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, SPM investments and multiclient seismic data capitalized. Management believes that this is an important measure because it represents funds available to reduce debt and pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value, such as making acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.  

Full-year 2014 income from continuing operations attributable to Schlumberger in accordance with GAAP of $5.643 billion, representing diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.31 versus $5.10 in 2013. Full-year 2014 income from continuing operations attributable to Schlumberger, excluding charges and credits, was $7.282 billion, representing diluted earnings per share of $5.57 versus $4.75 in 2013.  

Fourth-quarter 2014 income from continuing operations attributable to Schlumberger in accordance with GAAP was $302 million, representing diluted earnings-per-share from continuing operations of $0.23 versus $1.49 in the previous quarter, and $1.26 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth-quarter 2014 income from continuing operations attributable to Schlumberger, excluding charges and credits, was $1.941 billion, representing diluted earnings-per-share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, of $1.50 versus $1.35 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Schlumberger did not record any charges or credits in the third quarter of 2014.  

The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, total debt, cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, as more fully discussed in Schlumberger’s financial statements and filings with the SEC.
