Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On January 28, 2015 at its Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, the stockholders of Visa Inc. (the “Company”) approved amendments to the Company’s Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), to, among other things, provide the Company the ability to effect a stock split in the future in a manner that would preserve the relative ownership percentages of its stockholders. To effect the amendments, on the same day, the Company filed a certificate of amendment (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and subsequently filed a restatement of the Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Restated Certificate of Incorporation”).  

On February 27, 2015, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of correction (the “Certificate of Correction”) of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation correcting the inadvertent omission of a reference to the applicable conversion rate in Section 4.11 of Article IV thereof. The Certificate of Correction became effective upon filing.  

A copy of the Certificate of Correction, as filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 27, 2015, is attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
