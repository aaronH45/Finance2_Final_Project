Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  

The presentation referred to above contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which include any statements that are not historical facts, such as our financial and performance targets and other forecasts or expectations regarding business outlook; growth for Schlumberger as a whole and for each of its segments (and for specified products or geographic areas within each segment); oil and natural gas demand and production growth; oil and natural gas prices; improvements in operating procedures and technology; capital expenditures by Schlumberger and the oil and gas industry; the business strategies of Schlumberger’s customers; demand for our integrated services; the success of Schlumberger’s joint ventures and alliances and its integration of acquired companies; introduction of new technologies; future global economic conditions; and future results of operations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, global economic conditions; changes in exploration and production spending by Schlumberger’s customers and changes in the level of oil and natural gas exploration and development; demand for our integrated services and new technologies; Schlumberger’s future cash flows; general economic, political and business conditions in key regions of the world, including in Russia and the Ukraine; pricing erosion; weather and seasonal factors; operational delays; production declines; inability to acquire target companies or integrate new acquisitions; changes in government regulations and regulatory requirements, including those related to offshore oil and gas exploration, radioactive sources, explosives, chemicals, hydraulic fracturing services and climate-related initiatives; the inability of technology to meet new challenges in exploration; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize (or the consequences of such a development changes), or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the presentation, and Schlumberger disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
