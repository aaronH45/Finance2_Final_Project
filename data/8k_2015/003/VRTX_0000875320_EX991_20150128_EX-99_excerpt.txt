BOSTON -- Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq: VRTX) today reported consolidated financial results for the full-year and quarter ended December 31, 2014. The company also today provided detailed financial guidance for 2015. 

Vertex reported total 2014 GAAP revenues of $580 million, including revenues of $464 million from KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) in cystic fibrosis (CF). The 2014 GAAP net loss was $739 million, or $3.14 per share, which includes net charges of $227 million. The 2014 non-GAAP net loss was $511 million, or $2.17 per share. As of December 31, 2014, Vertex had approximately $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company has a $300 million secured loan that is currently outstanding.

Vertex reported total fourth quarter 2014 GAAP revenues of $145 million, including revenues of $124 million from KALYDECO in CF. The GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $177 million, or $0.74 per share, which includes net charges of $45 million. The non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $132 million, or $0.55 per share. 

"The potential approval and launch of the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and continued label and geographic expansion for KALYDECO are expected to significantly increase both the number of people treated with our medicines and our revenues to support the long-term growth of our business," said Jeffrey Leiden, M.D., Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vertex. "As our revenues grow over the coming years, we remain committed to both controlling our operating expenses to generate significant earnings growth and to investing in research and development to create transformative new medicines."

On January 11, 2015 in conjunction with the 33rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, Vertex reviewed its corporate strategy for 2015 and provided a comprehensive update on its research and development (R&D) programs focused on CF. The company today provided the following updates to its research and early development programs: 

Oncology: Vertex is developing VX-970 and VX-803 as potential medicines for the treatment of a broad range of cancer tumor types. Both VX-970 and VX-803 were discovered by Vertex scientists and are designed to regulate the repair of damaged DNA within cancer cells through inhibition of a protein kinase known as ATR. Vertex is currently evaluating VX-970 and VX-803 in open-label Phase 1 clinical studies in people with advanced solid tumors. 

Full-Year 2014 Non-GAAP Financial Results 

The total 2014 non-GAAP financial results exclude stock-based compensation expense, costs related to the relocation of the company's corporate headquarters, hepatitis C-related revenues and costs and other adjustments. The total 2013 non-GAAP financial results exclude stock-based compensation expense, costs related to the relocation of the company's corporate headquarters, certain hepatitis C-related revenues and costs including expenses related to Alios (HCV) and other adjustments. 

Total Non-GAAP Revenues: Total 2014 non-GAAP revenues were $535.8 million, including $463.8 million in net product revenues from KALYDECO. Collaborative revenues include $35.0 million of payments from Janssen related to the out-licensing of VX-787 for the treatment of influenza. The components of total 2014 non-GAAP revenues were:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2

net product revenues, compared to 2013, resulted primarily from the use of KALYDECO in the U.S. in people with the additional mutations approved by the FDA in February 2014 and from increased revenues from markets outside of the U.S. 

Non-GAAP Research and Development (R&D) Expenses and Sales, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: Total combined 2014 non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $919.8 million, compared to $1,096.7 million for 2013. This reduction of approximately $175 million was primarily the result of prioritization of investment toward medicines for CF and the completion of the Phase 3 program for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in the first half of 2014 and other cost control measures, which resulted in decreased R&D and SG&A expenses as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP Net Loss Attributable to Vertex: Vertex's total 2014 non-GAAP net loss was $511.2 million, or $2.17 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $203.3 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, for 2013. The increased non-GAAP net loss for 2014 was primarily the result of decreased INCIVEK and INCIVO revenues, which are now excluded from the company's non-GAAP financial results, and increased interest expense, partially offset by increased KALYDECO product revenues and decreased operating expenses.

Fourth Quarter 2014 Non-GAAP Financial Results 

The fourth quarter 2014 non-GAAP financial results exclude stock-based compensation expense, costs related to the relocation of the company's corporate headquarters, hepatitis C-related revenues and costs and other adjustments. The fourth quarter 2013 non-GAAP financial results exclude stock-based compensation expense, costs related to the relocation of the company's corporate headquarters, certain hepatitis C-related revenues and costs including expenses related to Alios (HCV) and other adjustments. 

Total Non-GAAP Revenues: Total non-GAAP revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $140.6 million, including $124.4 million in net product revenues from KALYDECO and $16.2 million from royalties and collaborative revenues. The components of total non-GAAP revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 were:

Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A Expenses: Total combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $236.0 million, compared to $273.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. This reduction reflects:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP Net Loss Attributable to Vertex: Vertex's fourth quarter 2014 non-GAAP net loss was $131.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $128.4 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2013. The non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 was similar to 2013 as a result of increased KALYDECO product revenues and decreased operating expenses, offset by

decreased INCIVEK and INCIVO revenues, which are now excluded from the company's non-GAAP financial results, and increased interest expense. 

Cash Position at December 31, 2014

As of December 31, 2014, Vertex had $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2013. In July 2014, Vertex entered into a credit agreement that provides for a secured loan of up to $500 million, $300 million of which Vertex received in July 2014 and is outstanding as of December 31, 2014.

compared to 2014 as a result of the planned pivotal Phase 3 program for VX-661 and investment in research and early-stage development programs.

•Non-GAAP SG&A Expenses: Vertex expects that full-year 2015 non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be in the range of $280 to $300 million. The expected increase in SG&A is a result of planned investment in the company's commercial infrastructure to support the potential global launch of the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. 

Vertex's expected non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense and certain other expenses recorded in 2015.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this press release, Vertex's financial results and financial guidance are provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, non-GAAP financial results exclude: (i) in 2014, stock-based compensation expense, costs related to the relocation of the company's corporate headquarters, hepatitis C-related revenues and costs and other adjustments and (ii) in 2013, stock-based compensation expense, costs related to the relocation of the company's corporate headquarters, certain hepatitis C-related revenues and costs including expenses related to Alios (HCV) and other adjustments. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP because management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the company's financial position. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally and to manage the company's business and to evaluate its performance. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.

INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) 

Ivacaftor (150 mg tablets) is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatory (CFTR) potentiator indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 6 years and older who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene. 

In the United States (U.S.) and Europe, ivacaftor is also indicated for the treatment of CF in patients age 6 and older who have one of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. In Canada, ivacaftor is indicated for these same mutations and additionally for G970R. Additionally, in the U.S. ivacaftor is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients age 6 and older who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene. 

Ivacaftor is not effective in patients with CF with 2 copies of the F508del mutation (F508del/F508del) in the CFTR gene. The safety and efficacy of ivacaftor in children with CF younger than 6 years of age have not been established. 

Elevated liver enzymes (transaminases; ALT and AST) have been reported in patients receiving ivacaftor. It is recommended that ALT and AST be assessed prior to initiating ivacaftor, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal. Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming ivacaftor dosing. 

Use of ivacaftor with medicines that are strong CYP3A inducers, such as the antibiotics rifampin and rifabutin; seizure medications (phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin); and the herbal supplement St. John's Wort, substantially decreases exposure of ivacaftor and may diminish effectiveness. Therefore, co-administration is not recommended. The dose of ivacaftor must be adjusted when used concomitantly with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors or when used in patients with moderate or severe hepatic disease. 

Cases of non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients up to 12 years of age treated with ivacaftor. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating ivacaftor treatment. 

Ivacaftor can cause serious adverse reactions including abdominal pain and high liver enzymes in the blood. The most common side effects associated with ivacaftor include headache; upper respiratory tract infection (the common cold), including sore throat, nasal or sinus congestion, and runny nose; stomach (abdominal) pain; diarrhea; rash; and dizziness. These are not all the possible side effects of ivacaftor. A list of the adverse reactions can be found in the product labeling for each country where ivacaftor is approved. Patients should tell their healthcare providers about any side effect that bothers them or does not go away. 

Please see KALYDECO (ivacaftor) U.S. Prescribing Information, EU Summary of Product Characteristics, Canadian Product Monograph, Australian Consumer Medicine Information and Product Information, Swiss Prescribing Information and Patient Information, and the New Zealand Datasheet and Consumer Medicine Information. 

Indication and Important Safety Information for INCIVEK (telaprevir)

INCIVEK® (telaprevir) is a prescription medicine used with the medicines peginterferon alfa and ribavirin to treat chronic (lasting a long time) hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in adults with stable liver problems, who have not been treated before or who have failed previous treatment. It is not known if INCIVEK is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.

Important Safety Information

14

INCIVEK® (telaprevir) should always be used in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. INCIVEK combination treatment may cause serious side effects including skin rash and serious skin reactions, anemia (low red blood cell count) that can be severe, and birth defects or death of an unborn baby.

Skin rashes are common with INCIVEK combination treatment. Sometimes these skin rashes and other skin reactions can become serious, require treatment in a hospital, and may lead to death. Patients should call their healthcare provider right away if they develop any skin changes or itching during treatment with INCIVEK. Their healthcare provider will decide if they need treatment or if they need to stop INCIVEK or any of their other medicines. Patients should not stop taking INCIVEK combination treatment without talking with their healthcare provider first.

Patients' healthcare providers will do blood tests regularly to check for anemia. If anemia is severe, the healthcare providers may tell them to stop taking INCIVEK.

INCIVEK combined with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin may cause birth defects or death of an unborn baby. Therefore, a patient should not take INCIVEK combination treatment if she is pregnant or may become pregnant, or if he is a man with a sexual partner who is pregnant. Females who can become pregnant and females whose male partner takes these medicines must have a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment, every month during treatment, and for 6 months after treatment ends. Patients must use two forms of effective birth control during treatment and for 6 months after all treatment has ended. These two forms of birth control should not contain hormones, as these may not work during treatment with INCIVEK.

INCIVEK and other medicines can affect each other and can also cause side effects that can be serious or life-threatening. There are certain medicines patients cannot take with INCIVEK combination treatment. Patients should tell their healthcare providers about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.

The most common side effects of INCIVEK combination treatment include itching, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anal or rectal problems (including hemorrhoids, discomfort, burning or itching around or near the anus), taste changes and tiredness. There are other possible side effects of INCIVEK, and side effects associated with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin also apply to INCIVEK combination treatment. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers them or doesn't go away.

Please see full Prescribing Information including Boxed Warning, and the Medication Guide for INCIVEK available at www.INCIVEK.com.
