NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., Jan. 30, 2015 — AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2014. 

“AbbVie delivered exceptional performance in 2014 with sales and earnings well above our original projections for the year,” said Richard A. Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive officer, AbbVie. “We returned to growth in 2014, a year ahead of schedule, and we expect to continue building on that momentum in 2015 with another year of strong performance. For 2015, we’re focused on commercial and operational execution and the advancement of our promising pipeline as we build the company for long-term sustainable growth.” 

Fourth-Quarter Results 

· Worldwide adjusted sales were $5.371 billion in the fourth quarter, up 5.1 percent. On an operational basis, adjusted sales increased 8.9 percent, excluding a 3.8 percent unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Worldwide sales under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) were $5.452 billion, up 6.7 percent on a reported basis and up 10.4 percent operationally. 

· Fourth-quarter sales growth was driven primarily by the continued strength of HUMIRA. Global HUMIRA sales increased 10.6 percent, or 14.4 percent on an operational basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Total company sales growth was also driven by operational growth from Synagis, Creon and Duodopa. 

· The adjusted gross margin ratio in the fourth quarter was 81.2 percent, excluding intangible asset amortization and other specified items, up 410 basis points versus fourth-quarter 2013. The gross margin ratio under GAAP was 79.5 percent.

Fourth-Quarter Results (continued) 

· Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was 29.1 percent of sales in the fourth quarter, reflecting the recent HCV launch and continued investment in our growth brands. On a GAAP basis, SG&A was 61.3 percent of sales, including specified items primarily related to the terminated Shire Plc (Shire) transaction. 

· Adjusted research and development (R&D) was 16.3 percent of sales in the quarter, reflecting funding actions in support of our mid- and late-stage pipeline and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. On a GAAP basis, R&D was 16.1 percent of sales. 

· Net interest expense was $63 million on an adjusted basis and $129 million on a GAAP basis. The adjusted tax rate was 22.5 percent in the quarter and 21.9 percent on a GAAP basis. 

· Fourth-quarter diluted earnings (loss) per share were ($0.51) on a GAAP basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.89 excludes intangible asset amortization expense and other specified items primarily related to the terminated Shire transaction. The impact of the Shire termination was comprised of the break fee ($0.66), mark-to-market and exit of certain foreign currency positions ($0.24) and other costs ($0.10). An additional ($0.08) of Shire specified charges will be booked in the first quarter of 2015 to reflect the completed liquidation of remaining foreign currency positions. 2015 GAAP guidance has been adjusted accordingly. 

Key Events from the Fourth Quarter 

· On Dec. 19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AbbVie’s VIEKIRA PAK, an all-oral, interferon-free treatment, with or without ribavirin (RBV), for the treatment of patients with chronic genotype 1 (GT1) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis. The approval of VIEKIRA PAK is supported by a robust clinical development program designed to study the safety and efficacy of the regimen in more than 2,300 enrolled patients across 25 countries. The program consisted of six pivotal Phase 3 studies, which demonstrated that VIEKIRA PAK cured 95-100 percent of GT1a and GT1b hepatitis C patients, including patients new and experienced to treatment, and patients with compensated cirrhosis, with less than 2 percent of patients experiencing virological failure. Additionally, more than 98 percent of patients in clinical trials completed a full course of therapy. 

· On Jan. 16, AbbVie announced that the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for its all-oral, short-course, interferon-free treatment of VIEKIRAX (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets) + EXVIERA (dasabuvir tablets). The treatment has been approved with or without RBV for patients with GT1 chronic HCV infection, including those with compensated liver cirrhosis, HIV-1 co-infection, patients on opioid substitution therapy and liver transplant recipients. Additionally, VIEKIRAX has been approved for use with RBV in genotype 4 chronic HCV patients. 

· On Jan. 12, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved DUOPA (carbidopa and levodopa) enteral suspension for the treatment of motor fluctuations for people with advanced Parkinson’s disease. DUOPA is administered using a small, portable infusion pump that delivers carbidopa and levodopa directly into the small intestine for 16 continuous hours via a procedurally-placed tube. In a clinical trial, patients treated with DUOPA experienced significantly greater improvement in “off” time (periods of poor mobility, slowness and stiffness) than patients treated with oral carbidopa-levodopa immediate release tablets.

Key Events from the Fourth Quarter (continued) 

· AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences announced positive top-line results from the first of two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elagolix in premenopausal women with endometriosis. Results from the trial show that after six months of treatment, both doses of elagolix (150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily) met the study’s co-primary endpoints (p<0.001) of reducing scores of non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP) and menstrual pain (or dysmenorrhea), associated with endometriosis, at month three, as well as month six, as measured by the Daily Assessment of Endometriosis Pain scale. Elagolix, currently being investigated in patients with pain from endometriosis, inhibits gonadatropin releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the pituitary gland and ultimately reduces circulating sex hormone levels. To date, elagolix has been studied in over 40 clinical trials totaling more than 3,000 patients. A Phase 2b trial of elagolix for the treatment of uterine fibroids is also ongoing. 

· At the American Society of Hematology’s 56th Annual Meeting, AbbVie presented new results from a Phase 2 study of investigational compound venetoclax (ABT-199/GDC-0199) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). AML is an aggressive and deadly type of blood cancer, in which the body produces too many of a specific type of white blood cell (myeloblast), which can crowd out healthy blood cells. In the study, the venetoclax group showed an overall response rate of 15.5 percent, with one patient achieving a complete response and four patients achieving a complete response with incomplete blood count recovery. These data indicate that further study of venetoclax in AML patients is warranted. Venetoclax will be studied in combination with other medicines sometimes used in treating patients with AML. Venetoclax is an investigational inhibitor of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of CLL and several other cancers. 

Confirming Full-Year 2015 Outlook 

AbbVie is confirming its adjusted diluted earnings-per-share guidance for the full-year 2015 of $4.25 to $4.45, which reflects industry-leading growth versus the prior year. The company’s 2015 adjusted diluted earnings-per-share guidance excludes $0.34 per share of intangible asset amortization expense and other specified items. Including these items, AbbVie’s diluted earnings-per-share guidance is $3.91 to $4.11 on a GAAP basis.
