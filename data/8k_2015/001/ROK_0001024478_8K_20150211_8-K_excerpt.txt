INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT  

 Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On February 11, 2015, Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, in connection with the offer and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.050% Notes due March 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $300 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% Notes due March 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes” and, together with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”) in an underwritten public offering (the “Offering”). The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification and contribution rights and obligations of the parties, termination provisions and other terms and conditions customary in agreements of this type. The issuance and sale of the Notes closed on February 17, 2015. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Notes, after deducting underwriter discounts and expenses, were approximately $594.2 million.  

Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory, corporate trust, commercial banking and investment banking services for the Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain affiliates of the underwriters are lenders under the Company’s credit facilities.  

The Notes were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to its automatic shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-202013) (the “Registration Statement”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 11, 2015, as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on February 12, 2015.  

The Notes were issued on February 17, 2015 pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of December 1, 1996 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Mellon Bank, N.A.), as trustee. The Indenture contains covenants that require the Company to satisfy certain conditions in order to incur debt secured by liens, engage in sale/leaseback transactions or merge or consolidate with another entity. The Indenture also provides for customary events of default.  

The 2020 Notes will mature on March 1, 2020 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.050% per annum. The 2025 Notes will mature on March 1, 2025 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.875% per annum. The Company will pay interest on the Notes from February 17, 2015 semi-annually, in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning September 1, 2015. The Notes are unsecured and rank on a parity with all of the Company’s other existing and future unsecured indebtedness.  

At its option, the Company may redeem the 2020 Notes at any time prior to February 1, 2020 (one month prior to the maturity date for the 2020 Notes), and the 2025 Notes at any time prior to December 1, 2024 (three months prior to the maturity date for the 2025 Notes), in each case, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled

 payments of the Notes to be redeemed if such Notes matured on February 1, 2020 (one month prior to the maturity date for the 2020 Notes), in the case of the 2020 Notes, and December 1, 2024 (three months prior to the maturity date for the 2025 Notes), in the case of the 2025 Notes, in each case excluding interest accrued as of the redemption date, discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the Notes) plus 10 basis points in the case of the 2020 Notes and 15 basis points in the case of the 2025 Notes.  

At its option, the Company may redeem the 2020 Notes at any time on and after February 1, 2020 (one month prior to the maturity date for the 2020 Notes) and the 2025 Notes at any time prior to December 1, 2024 (three months prior to the maturity date for the 2025 Notes), in each case, in whole or in part, at 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed.  

If a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as defined in the Notes) occurs, holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
