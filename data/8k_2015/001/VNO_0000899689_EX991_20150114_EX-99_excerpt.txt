Exhibit 99.1 

VORNADO REALTY TRUST

 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

On January 15, 2015, Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) completed the spin-off of Urban Edge Properties (“UE”), which owns the shopping center business previously owned and operated by Vornado, through a tax-free distribution to its shareholders (the “Distribution”). Vornado common shareholders and Vornado Realty L.P. (“VRLP”) common limited partners at the close of business on January 7, 2015 (the “Record Date”) received on January 15, 2015, a distribution of one UE common share for every two Vornado common shares or VRLP common limited partnership units held as of the Record Date. Fractional shares of UE were not distributed, and instead Vornado common shareholders and VRLP common limited partners will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares they would otherwise have been entitled to receive in the Distribution. Subsequent to the Distribution, Vornado will no longer consolidate the financial results of UE for the purpose of its own financial reporting. After the date of the Distribution, the historical financial results of UE will be reflected in Vornado’s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the Distribution date, beginning with the financial statements to be filed for the quarter ending March 31, 2015. 

The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of Vornado as of September 30, 2014 is presented as if the Distribution had occurred on September 30, 2014. The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income of Vornado for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are presented as if the Distribution had occurred on January 1, 2011. 

The accompanying unaudited pro forma financial information reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the pro forma results of operations and financial position of Vornado as of and for the periods indicated. In management’s opinion, these pro forma adjustments have been developed on a reasonable and rational basis; however, the retrospectively adjusted results of operations and financial position for the indicated periods when reported in Vornado’s post-Distribution periodic reports will differ from the pro forma financial information presented herein. The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is presented for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the financial condition or results of operations that would have actually occurred had the Distribution taken place during the periods presented or for the full year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, the accompanying unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect actions that may be undertaken by Vornado after the Distribution. The unaudited pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto and with the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in Vornado’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2014. 

The following is a brief description of the amounts recorded under each of the column headings in the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income:
