AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP REPORTS  

RECORD FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2014 PROFIT  

FORT WORTH, Texas – American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2014 results.  

   •   Reported record fourth quarter 2014 net profit excluding net special charges of $1.1 billion, up 153 percent versus the fourth quarter 2013. For the year, the Company’s 2014 net profit excluding net special charges was a record $4.2 billion, up 115 percent versus 2013  

   •   Completed the Company’s previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program more than one year before its expiration. Announced authorization of an additional $2 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2016  

   •   Declared a dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on February 23, 2015, to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2015  

For the fourth quarter 2014, American Airlines Group reported a record GAAP net profit of $597 million. This compares to a GAAP net loss of $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2013, which includes the results for US Airways only for the period from the completion of the merger on December 9, 2013, through December 31, 2013.  

For full year 2014, GAAP net profit was $2.9 billion, compared to a full year 2013 GAAP net loss of $1.8 billion for AMR Corporation, which includes the results for US Airways only for the period from the completion of the merger on December 9, 2013, through December 31, of 2013.  

The Company believes it is more meaningful to compare year-over-year results for American Airlines and US Airways excluding special charges and on a combined basis, which is a non-GAAP formulation that combines the results for AMR Corporation and US Airways Group. On this basis, the Company’s fourth quarter 2014 net profit excluding net special charges was a record $1.1 billion, or $1.52 per diluted share. This represents a 153 percent improvement over the combined non-GAAP net profit of $436 million excluding net special charges for the same period in 2013. The Company’s fourth quarter 2014 pretax margin excluding net special charges was a record 10.6 percent.

Excluding net special charges, the Company’s 2014 net profit was a record $4.2 billion, or $5.70 per diluted share. This represents a 115 percent improvement over the Company’s combined 2013 non-GAAP net profit excluding net special charges of $1.9 billion.  

See the accompanying notes in the Financial Tables section of this press release for further explanation of this presentation, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information.  

“Our record 2014 results close out a fantastic first year for our merger. These results would not have been possible without the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members,” said Doug Parker, American Airlines Group Chairman and CEO. “They have done a great job of working together to take care of our customers and restore American as the greatest airline in the world.  

“We have much to do in the year ahead as we continue to integrate two large carriers. The results we have achieved thus far, combined with our economic outlook, give us confidence that 2015 will be another outstanding year for American Airlines.”  

Revenue and Cost Comparisons  

Total revenue in the fourth quarter was a record $10.2 billion, an increase of 2.1 percent versus the fourth quarter 2013 on a combined basis and excluding special items, on a 1.7 percent increase in total available seat miles (ASMs). Consolidated passenger revenue per ASM (PRASM) was 13.50 cents, down 1.0 percent versus the fourth quarter 2013 on a combined basis. Consolidated passenger yield was a record 16.84 cents, up 0.9 percent year-over-year.  

Strong demand throughout the year led to 2014 total revenue of $42.7 billion, up 5.6 percent versus 2013 on a combined basis and excluding special items. Full year consolidated PRASM was 13.97 cents, up 2.2 percent versus 2013 on a combined basis.  

Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 4.1 percent compared to combined fourth quarter 2013 due primarily to a 17.3 percent decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Fourth quarter mainline cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 13.32 cents, down 6.1 percent on a 1.5 percent increase in mainline ASMs versus combined fourth quarter 2013. Excluding special charges and fuel, mainline CASM was 8.67 cents, up 1.1 percent compared to the combined fourth quarter 2013. Regional CASM excluding special charges and fuel was 15.87 cents, up 0.9 percent on a 3.8 percent increase in regional ASMs versus combined fourth quarter 2013. 

For the full year 2014, total operating expenses were $38.4 billion, up 1.5 percent versus combined 2013. Excluding special charges and fuel, mainline CASM increased 2.0 percent to 8.63 cents versus combined 2013. Regional CASM excluding special items and fuel increased 3.6 percent to 15.94 cents versus combined 2013.

Liquidity  

At December 31, 2014, American had approximately $8.1 billion in total cash and short-term investments, of which $774 million was restricted. The Company also had an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1.8 billion.  

Also in the fourth quarter, the Company returned $959 million to its shareholders through the payment of $72 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $887 million of common stock, or 20.5 million shares. When combined with the $113 million of shares repurchased in the third quarter 2014, the Company repurchased a total of 23.4 million shares at an average price of $42.72 per share in 2014. The Company’s $1 billion share repurchase program announced in July 2014 is now complete – more than one year ahead of its scheduled expiration. The Company also purchased approximately 52,000 shares from its Disputed Claims Reserve at the prevailing market price to satisfy certain tax obligations resulting from the November 4, 2014, distribution.  

As of December 31, 2014, approximately $656 million of the Company’s unrestricted cash and short-term investment balance was held in Venezuelan bolivars. This balance includes approximately $621 million valued at 6.3 bolivars and approximately $35 million valued at 12.0 bolivars, with the rate depending on the date the Company submitted its repatriation request to the Venezuelan government. These rates are materially more favorable than the exchange rates currently prevailing for other transactions conducted outside of the Venezuelan government’s currency exchange system. The Company’s cash balance held in Venezuelan bolivars decreased $65 million from the September 30, 2014 balance of $721 million. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company incurred an $11 million foreign currency loss related to the receipt of $23 million at a rate of 6.3 bolivars to the dollar for one of its 2012 repatriation requests originally valued at a rate of 4.3 bolivars to the dollar. Accordingly, the Company revalued its remaining pending 2012 repatriation requests from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the dollar resulting in additional foreign currency losses of $19 million. In total, the Company recognized a $30 million special charge for these foreign currency losses in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

The Company has significantly reduced capacity in this market. The Company is continuing to work with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. The Company is monitoring this situation closely and continues to evaluate its holdings of Venezuelan bolivars for additional foreign currency losses, which could be material.  

The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per share for shareholders of record as of February 9, 2015. The dividend will be paid on February 23, 2015. In addition, the Company announced that its Board also authorized an additional $2 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2016.  

Shares repurchased under the program announced above may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares or continue a dividend for any fixed period, and may be suspended at any time at management’s discretion.

(Unaudited)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: Percent change may not recalculate due to rounding.  

(A) American Airlines Group Inc. (formerly AMR Corporation) is a holding company and its principal, wholly owned subsidiaries are American Airlines, Inc. (“American”) and, effective December 9, 2013 (the “effective date”), US Airways Group, Inc. (“US Airways Group”). US Airways Group became a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (“AMR”) as a result of a merger transaction. Also in connection with the merger, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. (“AAG” or the “Company”). Therefore, the results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2013 include the results for US Airways Group only for the period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013. This impacts the comparability of AAG’s financial statements under GAAP to the 2014 period. Refer to the AAG combined financial statements for an alternative, non-GAAP presentation.  

(B) Pursuant to the Company’s Fourth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”), holders of AMR common stock formerly traded under the symbol “AAMRQ” received shares of AAG common stock principally over a 120-day distribution period following the effective date. The Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2013 includes the weighted effect of shares outstanding for both the pre and post-merger periods. The shares outstanding for the pre-merger period consist only of the AAMRQ shares. In accordance with GAAP, the 2013 three and twelve month periods weighted average shares and earnings per share calculation have been adjusted to retrospectively reflect these distributions, which were made at the rate of approximately 0.7441 shares of AAG common stock per share of AAMRQ. The shares outstanding for the 23 day post-merger period (December 9, 2013 through December 31, 2013) include the full amount of shares issued pursuant to the Plan adjusted for approximately 13 million shares withheld by the Company in satisfaction of employee tax obligations. Former holders of AAMRQ shares as of the effective date may in the future receive additional distributions of AAG common stock dependent upon the ultimate distribution of shares of AAG common stock to holders of disputed claims. Thus, the shares and related earnings per share calculation prior to the effective date may change in the future to reflect additional retrospective adjustments for future AAG common stock distributions to former holders of AAMRQ shares.

(A) Reflects GAAP financial results for American Airlines Group Inc. (“AAG” or the “Company”). AAG (formerly AMR Corporation) is a holding company and its principal, wholly owned subsidiaries are American Airlines, Inc. (“American”) and, effective December 9, 2013 (the “effective date”), US Airways Group, Inc. (“US Airways Group”). US Airways Group became a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (“AMR”) as a result of a merger transaction. Also in connection with the merger, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. Therefore, the results for the entire 2014 period include the results for US Airways Group.  

(B) US Airways Group applied acquisition accounting as of December 9, 2013 and its statements of operations for the period from December 9 through December 31, 2013 reflected the related adjustments. As a result, in accordance with GAAP, US Airways Group’s consolidated financial statements after December 9, 2013 are deemed not comparable to its financial statements for any period prior to the merger. However, to provide a basis for comparison to current year results, US Airways Group has combined the results for the predecessor and successor 2013 periods. Management believes this presentation provides a more meaningful quarter over quarter comparison.  

(C) Under GAAP, AAG does not include in its financial results the results of US Airways Group prior to closing of the merger. This impacts the comparability of AAG’s financial statements under GAAP to the 2014 period. This table presents the fourth quarter results for 2013 on a “combined basis.” Combined basis means the Company combines the financial results of AAG on a stand alone basis with the results of US Airways Group. Management believes this presentation provides a more meaningful quarter over quarter comparison. Please see GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.  

(D) Percent change is a comparison of the combined results.  

(E) Other revenues in the 2013 three month period includes a $31 million special credit related to a change in accounting method resulting from the modification of the Company’s AAdvantage miles agreement with Citibank. Excluding this special credit, the quarter over quarter increase in other revenues and total operating revenues was 14.4% and 2.1%, respectively.  

(F) Combined results exclude $13 million of US Airways Group nonoperating other, net expense, which was eliminated in consolidation with AAG. This expense represented a non-cash mark-to-market fair value adjustment for US Airways Group’s 7.25% convertible senior notes that were convertible into shares of AAG common stock subsequent to the merger.

Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information  

American Airlines Group Inc. (the “Company”) is providing the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors the ability to measure financial performance excluding special items, which is more indicative of the Company’s ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. The Company believes that the presentation of mainline and regional CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors because both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond the Company’s control. Management uses mainline and regional CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate the Company’s operating performance.

FOOTNOTES:  

 (1) As noted on the American Airlines Group Combined non-GAAP income statement, these tables present the 2013 fourth quarter and twelve month periods’ results on a “combined basis.” Combined basis means the Company combines the financial results of American Airlines Group on a stand alone basis with the results of US Airways Group for periods prior to closing of the merger. Management believes this presentation provides a more meaningful period over period comparison.  

 (2) The 2013 fourth quarter and twelve month periods included a special credit to other revenues related to a change in accounting method resulting from the modification of the Company’s AAdvantage miles agreement with Citibank.  

 (3) The 2014 fourth quarter mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $466 million, which principally included $280 million of merger integration expenses related to information technology, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance and retention, share-based compensation, fleet restructuring, re-branding of aircraft and airport facilities, relocation and training. In addition, the Company recorded a net $116 million charge for bankruptcy related items principally consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy settlement obligations as well as a $70 million charge related primarily to certain spare parts asset impairments. The 2014 twelve month period mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $800 million, which principally included $810 million of merger integration expenses as described above. In addition, the Company recorded a net charge of $81 million for bankruptcy related items as described above, $164 million in other special charges, including an $81 million charge to revise prior estimates of certain aircraft residual values, and other asset impairments, as well as $54 million in charges primarily relating to the buyout of certain aircraft leases. These charges were offset in part by a $309 million gain on the sale of slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.  

   The 2013 fourth quarter mainline special items totaled a net charge of $497 million, which principally included $424 million of merger related expenses related to the alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, share-based compensation and fees for US Airways to exit the Star Alliance and its codeshare agreement with United Airlines. In addition, the Company recorded a $107 million charge related to its pilot long-term disability obligation and a $33 million aircraft impairment charge. These charges were offset in part by a $67 million gain on the sale of slots at LaGuardia Airport. The 2013 twelve month period mainline special items totaled a net charge of $697 million, which consisted of the charges and gain discussed above as well as an additional $157 million in merger related expenses and a $43 million charge for workers’ compensation claims.  

 (4) The 2014 fourth quarter regional operating special items totaled a net charge of $16 million, which principally included a $24 million charge due to a new pilot labor contract at the Company’s Envoy regional subsidiary, offset in part by an $8 million gain on the sale of certain spare parts. The 2014 twelve month period regional operating special items totaled a net charge of $24 million, which consisted primarily of the above charge and gain as well as $7 million of merger integration expenses.  

   The 2013 fourth quarter regional operating special items primarily consisted of merger related expenses. The 2013 twelve month period regional operating special items primarily consisted of a credit due to a favorable arbitration ruling related to a vendor contract, offset in part by merger related expenses.  

 (5) The 2014 fourth quarter nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $31 million. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $656 million of the Company’s unrestricted cash and short-term investment balance was held in Venezuelan bolivars. This balance includes approximately $621 million valued at 6.3 bolivars and approximately $35 million valued at 12.0 bolivars, with the rate depending on the date the Company submitted its repatriation request to the Venezuelan government. These rates are materially more favorable than the exchange rates currently prevailing for other transactions conducted outside of the Venezuelan government’s currency exchange system. The Company’s cash balance held in Venezuelan bolivars decreased $65 million from the September 30, 2014 balance of $721 million. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company incurred an $11 million foreign currency loss related to the receipt of $23 million at a rate of 6.3 bolivars to the dollar for one of its 2012 repatriation requests originally valued at a rate of 4.3 bolivars to the dollar. Accordingly, the Company revalued its remaining pending 2012 repatriation requests from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the dollar resulting in additional foreign currency losses of $19 million. In total, the Company recognized a $30 million special charge for these foreign currency losses in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Company has significantly reduced capacity in this market. The Company is continuing to work with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. The Company is monitoring this situation closely and continues to evaluate its holdings of Venezuelan bolivars for additional foreign currency losses, which could be material. The 2014 twelve month period nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $132 million, which primarily included the Venezuelan currency loss described above as well as $56 million of early debt extinguishment costs related to the prepayment of 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness and $33 million of non-cash interest accretion on the bankruptcy settlement obligations.  

   The 2013 fourth quarter nonoperating special items totaled $21 million primarily related to interest charges to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Company’s Fourth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”). The 2013 twelve month period nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $218 million, which principally included interest charges of $138 million to recognize post-petition interest expense as described above as well as $110 million in charges primarily related to debt extinguishment costs incurred in connection with the repayment of high-interest aircraft financings and in connection with conversions of the 7.25% convertible senior notes. These charges were offset in part by a $30 million credit in connection with an award received in an arbitration related to previous investments in auction rate securities.  

 (6) In the 2013 fourth quarter and twelve month periods, the Company recognized reorganization expenses as a result of the filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11. These amounts consisted primarily of estimated allowed claim amounts and professional fees.  

 (7) During the 2014 fourth quarter, the Company recorded a special $6 million non-cash deferred income tax benefit related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the 2014 twelve month period, the Company sold its portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this sale, the Company recorded a special non-cash tax provision of $330 million in the second quarter of 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”), a subset of stockholders’ equity, principally in 2009. This provision represents the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of the Company’s fuel hedging contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company retained the $330 million tax provision in OCI until the last contract was settled or terminated. In addition, the 2014 twelve month period included a special $16 million non-cash deferred income tax provision related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.  

   The 2013 fourth quarter and twelve month period included a $324 million of net special income tax provision, which included a $538 million non-cash income tax benefit resulting from gains recorded in Other Comprehensive Income, offset in part by a $214 million non-cash deferred income tax charge related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.
