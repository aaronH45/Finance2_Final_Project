The two new notes offerings were 244 basis points lower in rate than the notes we retired during the year.

 Footnotes to Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

      Notes: 

(A)Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the related partnerships and joint ventures shown therein. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties. 

(B)The Unaudited Joint Venture Statements of Operations do not include any operations or our share of net income or excess investment amortization related to our investment in Klépierre. Amounts included in Footnotes D below exclude our share of related activity for our investment in Klépierre. For further information, reference should be made to financial information in Klépierre's public filings and additional discussion and analysis in our Form 10-K. 

(C)This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP, including FFO, FFO per share, comparable FFO per share and comparable EPS. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.  

We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.  

We have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment charges relating to, previously depreciated retail operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  

(D)Includes our share of: 

-Gains on land sales of $1.2 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, $15.6 million and $7.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

-Straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $14.2 million and $18.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively (including $0.0 million and $0.3 million related to WPG), and $59.1 million and $57.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively (including $0.3 million and $0.2 million related to WPG).

(E)Includes FFO of the operating partnership and 2014 transaction expenses related to WPG of $98.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013, and $108.0 million and $360.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

(F)Includes Basic and Diluted FFO per share related to WPG operations and 2014 transaction expenses of $0.27 for the three months ended December 31, 2013, and $0.30 and $0.99 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

(G)Includes Diluted FFO allocable to common stockholders and 2014 transaction expenses related to WPG of $84.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013, and $92.4 million and $308.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Non-cash impacts to FFO include:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States, including FFO, diluted FFO per share, funds available for distribution, net operating income (NOI), and comparable property NOI. FFO and NOI are performance measures that are standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO and NOI provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with the performance of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.  

The non-GAAP financial measures used in this report should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities.

(1)Excludes WPG properties and all prior periods have been restated. 

(2)Ending Occupancy is the percentage of total owned square footage (GLA) which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. 

(3)Total Sales PSF is defined as total sales of the tenants open and operating in the center during the reporting period divided by the associated company owned and occupied GLA on a trailing 12-month basis. Includes tenant sales activity for all months a tenant is open within the trailing 12-month period. In accordance with the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers, only stores with less than 10,000 square feet are included for malls. All company owned space is included for Premium Outlets. 

(4)Base Minimum Rent PSF is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in Ending Occupancy as defined above. 

(5)Releasing Spread is a "same space" measure that compares opening and closing rates on individual spaces, including spaces greater than 10,000 square feet. The Opening Rate is the average of the initial cash Total Rent PSF for spaces leased during the trailing 12-month period, and includes new leases and existing tenant renewals, amendments and relocations (including expansions and downsizings). The Closing Rate is the average of the final cash Total Rent PSF as of the month the tenant terminates or closes. Total Rent PSF includes Base Minimum Rent, common area maintenance (CAM) and base percentage rent. It includes leasing activity on all spaces occupied by tenants that would qualify to be included in Ending Occupancy as defined above as long as the opening and closing dates are within 24 months of one another. 

(6)Occupancy Cost as a Percentage of Sales is the trailing 12-month Base Minimum Rent, plus all applicable ancillary charges, plus overage rent, if applicable (based on last 12 months of sales), divided by the trailing 12-month Total Sales PSF for the same tenants.
