Exhibit 99.1  

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA  

COMBINED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the separate historical financial statements of M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) and Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (“Hudson City”) after giving effect to the merger and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2014 is presented as if the merger had occurred on September 30, 2014. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 are presented as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2013. The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted to reflect factually supportable items that are directly attributable to the merger and, with respect to the income statements only, expected to have a continuing impact on consolidated results of operations. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on the indicated dates. In particular, no adjustments have been made to the amounts of Hudson City’s provisions for credit losses or gains on investment securities that may not have been necessary had the acquired loans and investment securities been recorded at fair value as of January 1, 2013.  

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. M&T is the acquirer for accounting purposes. The unaudited pro forma adjustments, including the allocations of the purchase price, are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information. Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical financial statements of Hudson City to conform to the presentation in M&T’s financial statements.  

A final determination of the acquisition consideration and fair values of Hudson City’s assets and liabilities, which cannot be made prior to the completion of the merger, will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets of Hudson City that exist as of the date of completion of the transaction. Consequently, amounts preliminarily allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities could change significantly from those allocations used in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements presented below.  

In connection with the plan to integrate the operations of M&T and Hudson City following the completion of the merger, M&T anticipates that nonrecurring charges, such as costs associated with systems implementation, severance, and other costs related to exit or disposal activities, could be incurred. M&T is not able to determine the timing, nature and amount of these charges as of the date hereof. However, these charges could affect the results of operations of M&T and Hudson City, as well as those of the combined company following the completion of the merger, in the period in which they are recorded. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements do not include the effects of the costs associated with any restructuring or integration activities resulting from the transaction, as they are nonrecurring in nature and not factually supportable at the time that the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma adjustments do not give effect to any nonrecurring or unusual restructuring charges that may be incurred as a result of the integration of the two companies or any anticipated disposition of assets that may result from such integration.  

The actual amounts recorded as of the completion of the merger may differ materially from the information presented in these unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements as a result of:  

   •   changes in the trading price for M&T’s common stock;  

   •   net cash used or generated in Hudson City’s operations prior to completion of the merger;  

   •   other changes in Hudson City’s net assets that occur prior to the completion of the merger, which could cause material changes in the information presented below; and  

1  

   •   changes in the financial results of the consolidated company, which could change the future discounted cash flow projections.  

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements are provided for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily, and should not be assumed to be, an indication of the results that would have been achieved had the transaction been completed as of the dates indicated or that may be achieved in the future. The preparation of the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements and related adjustments required management to make certain assumptions and estimates. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements should be read together with:  

   •   the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements;  

   •   M&T’s separate audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in M&T’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013;  

   •   Hudson City’s separate audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 included in Hudson City’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 (as amended);  

   •   M&T’s separate unaudited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included in M&T’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014; and  

   •   Hudson City’s separate unaudited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included in Hudson City’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014.
