To implement changes to the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer of Wynn Resorts, Limited (the “Company”) that were addressed in the Company’s Proxy Statement for its May 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, on January 15, 2015, the Company entered into a seventh amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Employment Agreement, dated as of October 4, 2002, as amended, by and between the Company and Stephen A. Wynn, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the “Employment Agreement”). The Amendment provides for: (a) an extension of the term of the Employment Agreement for two years through October 24, 2022, (b) a decrease in base salary from $4.0 million to $2.5 million per year, and (c) termination of the current Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement dated as of November 25, 2002, as amended.
