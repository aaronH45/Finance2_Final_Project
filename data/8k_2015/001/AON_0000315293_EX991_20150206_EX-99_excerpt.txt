LONDON - February 6, 2015 - Aon plc (NYSE: AON) today reported results for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.

Net income attributable to Aon shareholders was $459 million, or $1.56 per share, compared to $355 million, or $1.14 per share, for the prior year quarter. Net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted for certain items, increased 23% to $1.89, compared to $1.54 in the prior year quarter, including a $0.06 per share unfavorable impact on adjusted net income from continuing operations if the Company were to translate prior year quarter results at current quarter foreign exchange rates ("foreign currency translation"). Certain items that impacted fourth quarter results and comparisons with the prior year quarter are detailed in the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings per Share” on page 13 of this press release. 

“We delivered twenty-three percent earnings growth in the fourth quarter driven by organic revenue growth and strong operating margin improvement in both segments, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management,” said Greg Case, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Results reflect a strong finish to 2014, having made significant investments in client serving capabilities while returning a record amount of capital to shareholders. Looking forward, we have positioned the firm for increased operating leverage, strong free cash flow generation and significant shareholder value creation in 2015.”

FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL SUMMARY

Total revenue increased 3% to $3.3 billion compared to the prior year quarter driven primarily by 6% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter decreased 1% to $2.7 billion compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to a $79 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, a $65 million decrease in formal restructuring costs, and a $10 million decrease in intangible asset amortization, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth, $35 million of expense related to legacy litigation, and a $17 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures.

Depreciation expense decreased 6%, or $4 million, to $59 million compared to the prior year quarter.

Intangible asset amortization expense decreased 10%, or $10 million, to $89 million compared to the prior year quarter, due to a $10 million decrease in HR Solutions primarily related to the Hewitt acquisition.

Restructuring savings in the fourth quarter related to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program are estimated at $101 million compared to $94 million in the prior year quarter. Of the estimated savings in the fourth quarter, approximately $76 million were related to the HR Solutions segment compared to $73 million in the prior year quarter, and approximately $25 million were related to the Risk Solutions segment compared to $21 million in the prior year quarter. 

The Company completed all remaining restructuring activities related to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program in the fourth quarter. Before any potential reinvestment of savings, the Aon Hewitt restructuring program delivered annual cumulative expense savings of approximately $402 million in 2014. Of the $402 million in annual cumulative expense savings, approximately $303 million of savings were achieved in HR Solutions and $99 million of savings were achieved in Risk Solutions.

Foreign currency exchange rates in the fourth quarter had a $0.06 per share, or $23 million, pretax unfavorable impact (-$22 million in Risk Solutions, -$2 million in HR Solutions, +$1 million in Unallocated expenses) on adjusted net income from continuing operations if the Company were to translate prior year quarter results at current quarter foreign exchange rates.

Effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 19.6% compared to 24.2% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by changes in the geographic distribution of income. 

Average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 293.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to 311.4 million in the prior year quarter. The Company repurchased 5.4 million Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter. The Company has $5.6 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program after giving effect to a $5.0 billion increase in authorization during the fourth quarter.

Cash flow from operations for 2014 increased 1% to a record $1.6 billion driven primarily by growth in net income and a decline in pension contributions, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from timing of significant receivable collections in the prior year period.

Free cash flow, as defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, for 2014 decreased 1% to $1.4 billion driven by an increase in cash flow from operations, offset by a $27 million increase in capital expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow from operations can be found on the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue and Free Cash Flow” on page 12 of this press release.

Interest expense increased $10 million to $67 million compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to an increase in total debt outstanding.

Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures

This communication includes supplemental information related to organic revenue, free cash flow, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, that exclude the effects of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, capital expenditures, transaction and integration costs and certain other noteworthy items that affected results for the comparable periods. Organic revenue excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, reimbursable expenses and unusual items. The impact of foreign exchange is determined by translating last year's revenue, expense or net income at this year's foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations are provided in the attached schedules. Supplemental organic revenue information and additional measures that exclude the effects of the restructuring charges and certain other items do not affect net income or any other GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flow from operating activity less capital expenditures. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. They should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.
