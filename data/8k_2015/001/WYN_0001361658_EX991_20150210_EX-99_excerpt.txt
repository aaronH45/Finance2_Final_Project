PARSIPPANY, N.J. (February 10, 2015) – Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:WYN) today announced results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014. 

Highlights: 

 ·Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.90, an increase of 23% from adjusted diluted EPS of $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Reported diluted EPS was $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2014, unchanged from the same period in 2013. 

 ·Full year adjusted diluted EPS was $4.53, an increase of 18% from adjusted diluted EPS of $3.83 for the prior year period. Reported diluted EPS was $4.18 compared with $3.21 for the prior year period.  

 ·During the quarter, the Company repurchased 2.1 million shares of its common stock for $171 million. For the full year, the Company spent $652 million to repurchase 8.6 million shares of its common stock. 

 ·The Company’s Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.42 from $0.35 per share, beginning with the dividend that is expected to be declared in the first quarter of 2015. 

 ·The Company increased its annual free cash flow target to $800 million from $750 million beginning in 2015. 

“A strong fourth quarter led to 18% growth in full-year adjusted EPS, capping another year of double-digit earnings growth,” said Stephen P. Holmes, chairman and CEO. “All three of our businesses performed well and we’re enthusiastic about the opportunities and initiatives that will drive growth going forward. As an indication of confidence in our prospects, the Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend.” 

FOURTH QUARTER 2014 OPERATING RESULTS 

Fourth quarter revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior year period, or 4% in constant currency. The increase reflects growth in all of the Company’s business segments. 

Adjusted net income was $112 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, compared with $96 million, or $0.73 per diluted share for the same period in 2013. The increases reflect stronger operating results in the Company’s lodging and vacation exchange and rentals businesses and lower net interest expense. EPS also benefited from the Company’s share repurchase program, which decreased weighted average diluted share count by 5% year-over-year. 

Reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $81 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, compared with $86 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2013. Reported net income in both periods reflects several items excluded from adjusted net income. The net result of these items unfavorably impacted fourth quarter 2014 net income by $31 million and unfavorably impacted fourth quarter 2013 net income by $10 million. Full reconciliations of adjusted results to GAAP results appear in Table 8 of this press release. 

FULL YEAR 2014 OPERATING RESULTS 

Revenues for full year 2014 were $5.3 billion, an increase of 5% over the prior year period. Adjusted net income for the full year 2014 was $573 million, or $4.53 per diluted share, compared with $515 million, or $3.83 per diluted share, for the prior year. The increases reflect stronger operating results across all of the Company’s businesses. EPS also benefited from the Company’s share repurchase program, which decreased weighted average diluted share count by 6% compared with 2013. 

Reported net income for full year 2014 was $529 million, or $4.18 per diluted share, compared with reported net income of $432 million, or $3.21 per diluted share, for the prior year period. Reported net income reflects several items excluded from adjusted net income. The net result of these items unfavorably impacted full year 2014 net income by $44 million and unfavorably impacted full year 2013 net income by $83 million. Full reconciliations of adjusted results to GAAP results appear in Table 8 of this press release. 

FULL YEAR 2014 CASH FLOW 

Free cash flow was $749 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $770 million for the same period in 2013.

Revenues were $267 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 9% increase over the fourth quarter of 2013.

Outlook  

Note to Editors: The guidance excludes possible future share repurchases, while analysts’ estimates often include share repurchases. This results in discrepancies between Company guidance and database consensus forecasts. 

For the full year 2015, the Company provides the following guidance: 

 ·Revenues of approximately $5.450 - $5.550 billion from $5.400 - $5.500 billion. 

 ·Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.285 - $1.315 billion from $1.300 - $1.330 billion, reflecting the adverse impact of foreign exchange partially offset by stronger underlying performance. Based on January 31, 2015 rates, foreign exchange movements have had a $25 million adverse effect on 2015 EBITDA guidance since the Company’s initial 2015 guidance, which was issued on October 24, 2014. The Company’s 2015 guidance reflects a $34 million adverse impact from foreign exchange compared with 2014 full year results. 

 ·Adjusted EPS of approximately $4.75 - $4.90 based on a diluted share count of 123 million from $4.70 - $4.85 based on a diluted share count of 125 million.

Presentation of Financial Information 

Financial information discussed in this press release includes non-GAAP measures, which include or exclude certain items. These non-GAAP measures differ from reported GAAP results and are intended to illustrate what management believes are relevant period-over-period comparisons and are helpful to investors as an additional tool for further understanding and assessing the Company’s ongoing core operating performance. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be considered an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. A complete reconciliation of reported GAAP results to the comparable non-GAAP information appears in the financial tables section of the press release. It is not practicable to provide a reconciliation of forecasted adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items cannot be reasonably estimated or predicted at this time.

OPERATING RESULTS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 

(In millions) 

In addition to other measures, management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon net revenues and “EBITDA”, which is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense (excluding consumer financing interest), early extinguishment of debt, interest income (excluding consumer financing interest) and income taxes, each of which is presented on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of performance for the Company's segments which when considered with GAAP measures, gives a more complete understanding of its operating performance. The Company’s presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. 

The following tables summarize net revenues and EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, as well as reconcile EBITDA to Net income attributable to Wyndham shareholders for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:

 FREE CASH FLOW    

We define free cash flow to be net cash provided by operating activities less property and equipment additions which we also refer to as capital expenditures. 

We believe free cash flow to be a useful operating performance measure to evaluate the ability of our operations to generate cash for uses other than capital expenditures and, after debt service and other obligations, our ability to grow our business through acquisitions, development advances and equity investments, as well as our ability to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities as a means for evaluating Wyndham Worldwide is that free cash flow does not represent the total cash movement for the period as detailed in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 

The following table provides more details on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measure and the related reconciliation between these financial measures:
