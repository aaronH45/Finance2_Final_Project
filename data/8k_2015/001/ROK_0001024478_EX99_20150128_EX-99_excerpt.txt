 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Company revises fiscal 2015 Adjusted EPS guidance to $6.50 to $6.80 due to currency headwinds

MILWAUKEE (January 28, 2015) — Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2015 first quarter sales of $1,574.4 million, down 1.1 percent from $1,591.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Organic sales grew 2.1 percent, and currency translation reduced sales by 3.4 percent.

Fiscal 2015 first quarter Adjusted EPS was $1.64, up 12 percent compared to $1.47 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Total segment operating earnings were $346.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, up 6 percent from $328.0 million in the same period of fiscal 2014. Total segment operating margin expanded to 22.0 percent from 20.6 percent a year ago, primarily due to higher organic sales, strong productivity, and favorable mix, partially offset by increased spending.

On a GAAP basis, fiscal 2015 first quarter net income was $214.2 million or $1.56 per share, compared to $198.1 million or $1.41 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Pre-tax margin increased to 18.3 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 from 17.1 percent in the same period last year.

Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Organic sales growth of 2 percent in the quarter was better than we expected, with particular strength in the Architecture & Software segment and the Latin America region. Although total sales were below last year due to the large currency headwind, Adjusted EPS growth of 12 percent provided a good start to the fiscal year."

Outlook

Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, "While most GDP and Industrial Production forecasts continue to call for stable growth in 2015, we are incorporating into our revised outlook a more significant headwind from a stronger U.S. dollar and the anticipated impact of lower oil prices. We now expect fiscal 2015 reported sales of about $6.6 billion, which includes a currency headwind of about 4.5 points and an organic sales growth range of 2.5 to 5.5 percent. Based on that sales outlook, we are revising our Adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $6.50 to $6.80. 

"Our revenue diversification works, and we’re executing very well across the globe. We remain excited about our opportunities across a broad range of industries, in Process, with OEMs and with The Connected Enterprise, and continue to invest in all of these areas."

Organic Sales

Our press release contains information regarding organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three months ended December 31, 2014 compared to sales for the three months ended December 31, 2013:

Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate

Our press release contains financial information and earnings guidance regarding Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, which are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects. We define non-operating pension costs as defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements. These components of net periodic benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance; we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business. We believe that Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period. Our measures of Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate may be different from measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations, diluted EPS and effective tax rate.

The following are the components of operating and non-operating pension costs for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:

Free Cash Flow

Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.

In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.

The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:

Return On Invested Capital

Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:

(a) Income from continuing operations, before interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, for the most recent twelve months, divided by;

(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners’ equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, multiplied by;

(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the twelve-month period.

ROIC is calculated as follows:
