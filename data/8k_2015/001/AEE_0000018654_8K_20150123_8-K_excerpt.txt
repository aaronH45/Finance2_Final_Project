ITEM 8.01 Other Events.  

On January 23, 2015, Ameren Illinois Company (“AIC”) filed a request with the Illinois Commerce Commission (“ICC”) seeking approval to increase its natural gas delivery service rates by $53 million annually. The natural gas rate increase request is based on a 10.25 percent return on equity, a capital structure composed of 50% equity, a rate base of $1.2 billion, and a test year ended December 31, 2016.  

The ICC proceedings relating to the proposed natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the ICC required by December 2015 and new rates expected to be effective in January 2016. AIC cannot predict the level of any natural gas delivery service rate change that the ICC may approve, when any rate change may go into effect, or whether any rate increase that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for AIC to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when such increase goes into effect.  

This combined Form 8-K is being filed separately by Ameren Corporation and Ameren Illinois Company (each a “registrant”). Information contained herein relating to any individual registrant has been filed by such registrant on its own behalf. No registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other registrant.
