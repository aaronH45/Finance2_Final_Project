Safe Harbor and Regulation G Statement 

This presentation contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities  

Litigation Reform Act of 1995 concerning our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Forward-looking  

statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, which could cause actual results to differ  

materially from these statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking  

statements can be identified by such words as “anticipates,” “believes,” “plan,” “assumes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”  

“may,” “plans to,” “will” and similar references to future periods. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in  

this presentation regarding our strategies, prospects, financial condition, operations, costs, plans and objectives are forward-looking  

statements. The following are important factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our  

forward-looking statements: the expected cash tax benefits associated with the Settlement agreement (as defined in our 2013 Annual 

Report on Form 10-K), global economic and political conditions, changes in our credit ratings, changes in raw material pricing and  

availability, changes in energy costs, competitive conditions, success of our restructuring activities, currency translation and  

devaluation effects, the success of our financial growth, profitability, cash generation and manufacturing strategies and our cost  

reduction and productivity efforts, the effects of animal and food-related health issues, pandemics, consumer preferences,  

environmental matters, regulatory actions and legal matters, and the other information referenced in the “Risk Factors” section  

appearing in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as revised  

and updated by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Any forward-looking statement made by us  

are based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no  

obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as  

a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.  

Our management uses non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s performance, which exclude items we  

consider unusual or special items. We believe the use of such financial measures and information may be useful to investors. We  

believe that the use of non-U.S. GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of core operating results and future  

prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company's performance, especially when comparing such  

results to previous periods or forecasts. Please see Sealed Air’s February 10, 2015 earnings press release for important information  

about the use of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures relevant to this presentation, including applicable reconciliations to U.S. GAAP  

financial measures. Information reconciling forward-looking non-U.S. GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP measures is not available  

without unreasonable effort.
