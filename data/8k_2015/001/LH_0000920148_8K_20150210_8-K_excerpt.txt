Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure

On February 10, 2015, Laboratory Corporation of America® Holdings (LabCorp®) (NYSE: LH) announced today the availability of a new Diabetes Patient Education report for type 2 diabetes patients that aligns with the American Diabetes Association (Association) “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes - 2015,” which was published as a supplement to the January 2015 edition of the Association’s Diabetes Care journal. LabCorp’s Diabetes Patient Education report is a patient-specific education tool that graphically displays results for key tests used to monitor diabetes and its complications, such as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), LDL cholesterol, and urine albumin. The report provides, in patient-friendly terms, guidance to help understand test results and suggestions on how to maintain or improve diabetes control and overall cardiovascular risk, focusing on dietary and lifestyle changes. These reports can be conveniently ordered by clinicians treating patients with elevated HbA1c results or a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The reports are part of a suite of decision support tools available from LabCorp to assist clinicians and patients in the management of common chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and now, type 2 diabetes.
