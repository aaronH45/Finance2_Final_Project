“Our second quarter financial results were generally in-line with our expectations, as we made consistent progress on our business transformation initiatives and did a good job of remaining focused on the needs of our customers. As a result, we generated solid case volume growth of nearly 4% and managed acute inflationary pressures effectively,” said Bill DeLaney, Sysco’s president and chief executive officer. “We continue to have opportunities to improve our management of operating expenses and have multiple initiatives underway to address this area of our business.”  

Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Summary  

Sales for the second quarter were $12.1 billion, an increase of 7.6%. Food cost inflation was 6.0%, as measured by the estimated change in Sysco’s product costs, driven mainly by inflation in the meat and dairy categories.

Gross profit for the second quarter was $2.1 billion, an increase of 6.1%. Gross margin declined 23 basis points to 17.25%.  

Adjusted operating expenses for the second quarter increased $108 million, or 6.8%, due to a $115 million increase in payroll expense. Payroll expense increased mainly due to higher incentive accruals, higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, higher delivery costs and acquired operations.  

Operating expenses for the second quarter increased $157 million, or 9.7%, primarily due to an increase in payroll expense noted above and a $48 million increase in certain items. Certain items increased primarily due to higher merger and integration planning costs.

US Foods Merger Update  

Sysco today announced a definitive agreement to divest certain assets to Performance Food Group contingent upon the closing of its proposed merger with US Foods. Sysco has worked with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over the past 12 months to find a solution to the concerns raised by the FTC, and believes that this divestiture package solves those concerns. At this time, the FTC has not agreed to this solution, so the company will now present its position, including this proposed remedy, to the five FTC commissioners and seek to obtain their approval. Please see a separate release dated February 2, 2015, with information about the divestiture agreement.

Forward-Looking Statements  

Statements made in this press release or in our earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 that look forward in time or that express management’s beliefs, expectations or hopes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements reflect the views of management at the time such statements are made and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These statements include our plans and expectations related to and the benefits and expected timing of our business transformation initiatives, expectations and efforts regarding management of operating expenses, our plans and expectations related to and the benefits of the proposed merger with US Foods, and our plans and expectations related to acquisitions. These statements also include expectations regarding our sales growth, operating expense growth and operating performance results, trends in our locally-managed business and overall sales mix, market conditions and trends, growth opportunities, inflation, fuel expense, interest expense, our expense management and cost per case performance, share repurchases, business transformation costs and expenses, investments in technology resources, free cash flow and capital expenditures. The success of our business transformation initiatives and expectations regarding our operating performance are subject to the general risks associated with our business, including the risks of interruption of supplies due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, crop conditions, work stoppages, intense competition, technology

 disruptions, dependence on large regional and national customers, inflation risks, the impact of fuel prices, adverse publicity, and labor issues. Risks and uncertainties also include risks impacting the economy generally, including the risks that the current general economic conditions will deteriorate, or consumer confidence in the economy may not increase and decreases in consumer spending, particularly on food-away-from-home, may not reverse. Market conditions may not improve as anticipated. If sales from our locally managed customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from regional and national customers, our gross margins may continue to decline. Our ability to meet our long-term strategic objectives to grow the profitability of our business depends largely on the success of our Business Transformation Project. There are various risks related to the project, including the risk that the project and its various components may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame, if at all, and may prove costlier than expected; the risk that the actual costs of the ERP system may be greater or less than currently expected because we have encountered, and may continue to encounter, the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget, including the incurrence of expenses at an earlier or later time than currently anticipated; the risk that our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience delays in deployment, operating problems, cost overages or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the ERP implementation process; and the risk of adverse effects to our business, results of operations and liquidity if the ERP system, and the associated process changes, do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate. Planned deployments in the coming quarters are dependent upon the success of the ERP system and the updates at the current locations. We may experience delays, cost overages or operating problems when we deploy the system to additional locations. Our plans related to and the timing of the implementation of the ERP system, as well as the cost transformation and category management initiatives, are subject to change at any time based on management’s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs. We may fail to realize anticipated benefits, particularly expected cost savings, from our cost transformation initiative. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting efforts, we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease. We may also fail to realize the full anticipated benefits of our category management initiative, and may be unable to successfully execute the initiative in our anticipated timeline. Capital expenditures may vary from those projected based on changes in business plans and other factors, including risks related to the implementation of our business transformation initiatives and our regional distribution centers, the timing and successful completions of acquisitions, construction schedules and the possibility that other cash requirements could result in delays or cancellations of capital spending. Periods of high inflation, either overall or in certain product categories, can have a negative impact on us and our customers, as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food-away-from-home market, and may negatively impact our sales, gross profit, operating income and earnings. Expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and risks, including compliance with local laws, regulations and customs and the impact of local political and economic conditions, and such expansion efforts may not be successful. Any business that we acquire may not perform as expected, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. The consummation of the merger with US Foods is subject to regulatory approval and the satisfaction of certain conditions, and we cannot predict whether the necessary conditions will be satisfied or waived and the requisite regulatory approvals received. We also may be subject to potential antitrust or similar lawsuits at the federal or state level. Sysco and US Foods may be required to take certain actions to obtain regulatory approval for the merger, including the divestiture of assets, which could negatively impact the projected benefits of the merger. Termination of the merger agreement with US Foods could require Sysco to make a termination payment of $300 million, which could adversely impact Sysco’s stock price, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of uncertainties surrounding the proposed merger, prospective suppliers and customers may delay or decline to enter into agreements with us, and we may also lose current suppliers and customers, and fail to retain key employees. The pending merger and our current pre-merger integration planning efforts may divert our management’s attention from day-to-day business operations and the execution of our business transformation initiatives, which could result in performance shortfalls. Integration of the businesses of Sysco and US Foods may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the merger may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits, including cost synergies. We may fail to retain some of US Foods’ vendors and customers after the proposed merger. In relation to the merger, we have issued additional debt and our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position. For a discussion of additional factors impacting Sysco’s business, see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 2014, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Company’s subsequent filings with the SEC. Sysco does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements.

Impact of Certain Items   

(In Thousands, Except for Share and Per Share Data)  

Sysco’s results of operations are impacted by certain items which include multiemployer withdrawal charges (MEPP), severance charges, US Foods merger and integration planning costs, charges from facility closures, US Foods related financing costs and a change in estimate of self-insurance specific to fiscal 2014, (collectively referred to as “Certain Items”). Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, interest expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items provides an important perspective with respect to our results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that removes these items which are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated, and which, as a result are difficult to include in analyst’s financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity. Sysco believes the adjusted totals facilitate comparison on a year-over-year basis.  

The company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. As a result, in the tables that follow, each period presented is adjusted to remove the Certain Items noted above.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  The net earnings and diluted earnings per share impacts are shown net of tax. Tax impact of adjustments for Certain Items was $46,224 and $11,457 for the 13-week periods ended December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively. Amounts are calculated by multiplying the operating income impact of each item by each quarter’s effective tax rate.  

 (2)  Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding. Total diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings for certain items and adjusted net earnings—underlying business, both divided by diluted shares outstanding.

Free Cash Flow  

(In Thousands)  

Free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment and includes proceeds from sales of plant and equipment. Sysco considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. We do not mean to imply that free cash flow is necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. Free cash flow should not be used as a substitute in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. In the table that follows, free cash flow for each period presented are reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities.
