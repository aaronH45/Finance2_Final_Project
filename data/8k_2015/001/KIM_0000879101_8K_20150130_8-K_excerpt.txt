Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

On January 30, 2015 (the “Effective Date”), Kimco Realty Corporation (the “Company”) entered into a new $650 million unsecured term loan credit facility, pursuant to a Credit Agreement among the Company, the several banks, financial institutions and other entities from time to time parties thereto, PNC Bank, National Association, a national banking association, as administrative agent, and the other parties thereto (the “Credit Agreement”). 

Interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrues at a spread (currently 0.95%) to LIBOR or, at the Company’s option, a spread (currently 0.00%) to the base rate defined in the Credit Agreement, and in each case fluctuates in accordance with changes in the Company’s senior debt ratings.  

The credit facility is scheduled to expire on the second anniversary of the date of the Credit Agreement, with three one-year extension options. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company, among other things, is subject to covenants requiring the maintenance of (i) maximum indebtedness ratios and (ii) minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios.  

The Company used approximately $400 million of the proceeds of the borrowings under the Credit Agreement on the Effective Date to repay the outstanding obligations under the $400 million Credit Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2012 and amended on March 17, 2014, among the Company, the several banks, financial institutions and other entities from time to time parties thereto, PNC Bank, National Association, a national banking association, as administrative agent, and the other parties thereto, which was terminated on the Effective Date. The Company intends to use the remainder of the proceeds for general corporate purposes. 

The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
