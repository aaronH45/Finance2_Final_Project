Item 2.03  CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN

  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.

On January 29, 2015, SCANA Corporation (“SCANA”) closed on an unsecured $150 million, three-month credit facility (the “Facility”). The Facility will terminate on May 4, 2015, and the lender’s commitment to make loans under the Facility will terminate on February 6, 2015 to the extent such commitment remains undrawn on that date.

Loans under the Facility, if any, will be used to repay certain existing indebtedness of SCANA and for general purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Facility will be calculated at market index rates plus, in the case of certain of the market index rates, a spread applicable to the market index rate.

The Facility contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. The Facility requires SCANA to maintain a ratio of consolidated adjusted debt to consolidated total capitalization of not more than 0.7 to 1.0. Upon an uncured event of default under the Facility, all amounts owing under the Facility, if any, will become immediately due and payable and the lender may terminate its commitment.

The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the credit agreement for the Facility filed as an exhibit hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
