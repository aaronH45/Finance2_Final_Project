adjustments. For the full year, revenue increased by 0.1%, or $13 million, and would have increased $164 million if not for a $90 million decline related to divestitures of certain operations and a $61 million decline related to foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign currency translation negatively affected full year adjusted earnings per share by a negative $0.02 per diluted share. 

• Internal revenue growth from yield for collection and disposal operations was 2.0% for the fourth quarter and 2.3% for the full year. 

• Core price increases, which consist of price increases and fees (excluding fuel surcharges), net of rollbacks, were 3.9% for the fourth quarter, flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, and were 4.0% for the full year compared to 3.8% for the full year 2013. (c) 

• Internal revenue growth from volume was negative 0.8% for the fourth quarter, a sequential improvement from a negative 1.3% in the third quarter. For the full year, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 1.4%. 

• Recyclable commodity prices had a negative $0.03 per diluted share effect on the quarter, but were more than offset by benefits from operational improvements in the recycling line of business. Overall, recycling operations positively affected earnings by $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, despite an average OCC commodity price decline of 23.7%. 

• Operating expenses improved by $97 million in the fourth quarter and $110 million for the full year. In both the fourth quarter and full year, the majority of the savings were for costs associated with recently divested businesses. We also saw meaningful benefits from our focus on flexing down costs and reduced fuel expense. 

• SG&A expenses were relatively flat in the fourth quarter and were 10.9% of revenue compared to 10.7% in the prior year period. We realized significant savings from our restructuring during the quarter, but the benefits were largely offset by long-term incentive compensation accruals and certain legal reserves and fees. Without these accruals, SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue would have been 10.3%.(b) For the full year, SG&A expenses were 10.6% of revenue compared to 10.5% in the prior year. Adjusting for the same fourth quarter accruals and third quarter legal reserves, SG&A expenses were 10.2% of revenue for 2014.(b) 

• In the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $520 million and capital expenditures were $370 million. For the full year 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.33 billion and capital expenditures were $1.15 billion. 

• Free cash flow was $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter; for the full year 2014 free cash flow was $3.4 billion. The Company sold several assets and over-paid approximately $210 million of 2015 cash taxes in 2014. Without these affects, free cash flow would have been $360 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $1.4 billion for the full year.(b) 

• The Company returned $172 million to shareholders in dividends during the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, the Company returned $1.29 billion to shareholders, consisting of $693 million in dividends and $600 million in common stock repurchases.  

• The recorded effective tax rate was approximately 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 23.6% for the full year. The rates were lower than the Company’s expected rate of 35% primarily due to tax implications of divestitures, which are reflected in the $0.61 per diluted share that was excluded from our as-adjusted results. We did include in our as-adjusted earnings per share a $0.02 tax benefit from adjustments to accruals and related deferred taxes and audit settlements that also lowered our effective rate. Adjusting the Company’s recorded rate for all of these items, the tax rate was approximately 33%.(b)     

2015 OUTLOOK 

The Company announced the following with regard to its financial outlook for 2015: 

• Adjusted earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $2.48 and $2.55, an increase of between 8% and 11% when 2014 is adjusted for divestiture earnings. (b) 

• Free cash flow for 2015 is projected to be between $1.4 and $1.5 billion excluding any proceeds from divestitures. Proceeds from divestitures are expected to be between $50 and $100 million.(b)  

• Internal revenue growth from yield on the collection and disposal business is expected to be 2.0% and internal revenue growth from volume is expected to be between a negative 0.5% to flat. 

• Core price is expected to be approximately 3.8% for 2015.(c) 

• Recycling operations improvements are not expected to keep pace with recent recycling commodity price declines such that the recycling line of business is estimated to be between a negative $0.03 and $0.05 per diluted share headwind in 2015 compared to 2014, assuming no further degradation in the prices of commodities. 

• SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue are expected to be below 10% for the full year. 

• The tax rate is expected to be approximately 36.0%. 

• Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.2 to $1.3 billion. 

• The Board of Directors has indicated its intention to increase the dividend by $0.04 to $1.54 per share on an annual basis, for an approximate annual cost of $700 million. The Board must separately declare each dividend. 

• The Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion. 

Steiner continued, “In 2014 Waste Management’s goals were to continue our focus on price growth and cost controls, while improving our core solid waste business. We met those goals, and that focus led us to exceed our original full year adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. Our free cash flow is strong, at $3.4 billion for the year. If we exclude the sale proceeds and an approximate $210 million overpayment of cash taxes, our free cash flow was about $1.4 billion.(b) 

“In 2014, we completed the divestiture of our waste-to-energy assets and solid waste operations in Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada. Those assets accounted for about $0.18 of diluted earnings per share and approximately $230 million of operating EBITDA in 2014. In 2015, we expect to be able to enter into acquisition agreements to replace most, if not all, of that amount. We will be disciplined in our approach to buying assets, and believe we can replace the operating EBITDA of our recent divestitures and still have significant proceeds from our Wheelabrator divestiture to apply to other accretive priorities, including share buy backs or tuck-in acquisitions. Combined with our strong free cash flow, we believe that we can apply significant funds to these areas, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. 

“With respect to acquisitions, given the time necessary to identify targets, negotiate agreements and get any necessary regulatory approvals, our guidance assumes that we will not close any acquisitions in 2015 other than the previously announced acquisition of Deffenbaugh Disposal and our normal tuck-in acquisitions.    

“We expect to begin to repurchase shares once we have determined the amount of proceeds that will be applied to acquisitions. We should know that by mid-year. So, in the second half of the year we will likely enter the market to buy shares, and we expect to purchase at least enough shares to offset any dilution in 2015.” 

Steiner concluded, “So, 2015 will be a transition year in which we continue our pricing and cost efforts while focusing on redeploying the Wheelabrator proceeds. In our solid waste business, we have targeted about 10% earnings growth in 2015 and another year of strong free cash flow growth. We plan to redeploy Wheelabrator proceeds in 2015, setting the stage for accelerated earnings and free cash flow growth in 2016.”    

(a) For purposes of this press release, all references to “Net loss” and “Net income” refer to the financial statement line items “Net income (loss) attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” and “Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.,” respectively. 

(b) This press release contains a discussion of non-GAAP measures, as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP, but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with (i) additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance and are not representative or indicative of its results of operations and (ii) financial measures the Company uses in the management of its business. Accordingly, net income, earnings per diluted share, SG&A expenses, and our effective tax rate have been presented in certain instances excluding items identified in the reconciliations provided. 

The Company’s projected full year 2015 earnings per diluted share and projected earnings growth are not based on GAAP net earnings per diluted share and are anticipated to be adjusted to exclude the effects of events or circumstances in 2015 that are not representative or indicative of the Company’s results of operations. Projected GAAP earnings per diluted share for the full year would require inclusion of the projected impact of future excluded items, including items that are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairments and one-time items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures or litigation, or other items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, the Company does not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted projected full year earnings per diluted share or projected earnings growth to a GAAP earnings per diluted share projection. 

The Company also discusses free cash flow and provides projections of free cash flow and free cash flow growth. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. The company discusses free cash flow because the Company believes that it is indicative of its ability to pay its quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay its debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. However, the Company believes free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how the Company views its liquidity. Nevertheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. The Company defines free cash flow as: 

• Net cash provided by operating activities 

• Less, capital expenditures 

• Plus, proceeds from divestitures of businesses (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets. 

The Company’s definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and therefore is not subject to comparison. 

The quantitative reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used herein to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules, with the exception of projected earnings per diluted share and earnings growth. Management refers to GAAP income from operations before depreciation and amortization as “Operating EBITDA.” Our “traditional solid waste business” is comprised of collection, landfill and transfer stations. As such, it only includes a subset of our operations and these results are not calculated using, and cannot be reconciled to, GAAP measures available in our financial statements. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, and investors are urged to take into account GAAP measures as well as non-GAAP measures in evaluating the Company. 

(c) Core price is a performance metric used by management and is based on certain historical assumptions to allow for comparability between reporting periods.

Supplemental Data Adjusted For Divestitures  

(Dollars In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)  

(Unaudited)  

The following table presents certain financial measures that have been adjusted to exclude amounts attributed to operations that were divested in 2014. These are non-GAAP measures; please see footnote (a) for information about reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. We have included this information because the Company had significant divestitures in 2014; accordingly, management believes that presenting certain financial measures as adjusted to exclude amounts attributed to divested operations will help investors understand the basis for the Company’s 2015 financial projections.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) There were no adjustments to our full year 2014 as-reported revenue. For reconciliations of the other adjusted amounts to the most comparable GAAP measure, please see the reconciliation of earnings per diluted share on page 9, the reconciliations of free cash flow and net cash provided by operating activities on page 11 and the reconciliations of income from operations and operating EBITDA below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (b) Primarily includes the divesture of our waste-to-energy business and other solid waste assets.  

 (c) Adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2015 are projected to be between $2.48 and $2.55, an increase of between 8% and 11% when 2014 results are further adjusted to remove earnings attributed to operations that were divested.
