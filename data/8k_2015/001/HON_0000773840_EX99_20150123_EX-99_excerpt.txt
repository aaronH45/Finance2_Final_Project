“In the fourth quarter, Honeywell delivered 4% organic sales growth and achieved 15% earnings per share growth (excluding the pension mark-to-market adjustment), exceeding the high end of our guidance range and capping off another year of terrific performance in 2014,” said Honeywell Chairman and CEO Dave Cote. “Strong execution in our businesses and continued momentum across the portfolio throughout the year helped us to deliver on our aggressive 2014 sales, margin, and EPS targets. We achieved significant margin expansion in 2014 with benefits from our key process and productivity initiatives, and increased organic growth by continuing to ‘seed plant’ with investments in new products and technologies, high ROI capex, and expansion of our global footprint. Consistent with what we guided in December, we sold the remaining BEAV shares in the fourth quarter and proactively funded Aerospace OEM incentives related to new platform wins. We remain cautious in our planning with regard to the global economy, but are confident that our balanced portfolio mix of short- and long-cycle businesses is well-positioned to deliver on our 2015 commitments that include higher organic sales, continued margin expansion, and double-digit earnings growth. Honeywell’s five year plan is on target and we expect that improving end markets, new product introductions, penetration in high-growth regions, and benefits from our HOS Gold initiative will drive both growth and productivity throughout the company.” 

The company also reaffirms its full-year 2015 guidance:

Q4’14 Results - 3 

 ●Sales for the fourth quarter were down (6%) on a reported basis driven by the unfavorable impact of OEM incentives, the Friction Materials divestiture, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Excluding these items, sales in the fourth quarter were up 4% on an organic basis. Commercial OE sales were up 7% on an organic basis, reflecting an increase in Business and General Aviation (BGA) engine shipments. Commercial Aftermarket sales were up 4% on an organic basis, driven by continued Air Transport and Regional (ATR) spares growth, and higher Repair & Overhaul activities. Defense & Space sales were up 2% on an organic basis as a result of strong international growth. Transportation Systems sales were up 4% on an organic basis, primarily driven by new platform launches and higher turbo gas penetration globally. 

 ●Segment profit for the fourth quarter was down (14%), and segment margins contracted (160) bps to 17.3%, driven by the unfavorable impact of fourth quarter OEM incentives, partially offset by productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence, and the favorable impact of the Friction Materials divestiture. Excluding the impact of the $184 million fourth quarter 2014 OEM incentives, segment profit was up 10%, and segment margins expanded 210 basis points. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ●Sales for the fourth quarter were up 3% reported, or 6% on an organic basis, primarily driven by strong organic growth across the portfolio, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Energy, Safety, and Security (ESS) sales increased, particularly in Scanning & Mobility, Fire and Industrial Safety, and Security; and Building Solutions & Distribution (BSD) saw continued strength in the Americas Distribution business as well as acceleration in Building Solutions, most notably in the Americas region. 

 ●Segment profit for the fourth quarter was up 8% and segment margins expanded 70 bps to 15.9% driven primarily by higher volumes, M&A integration execution, and productivity net of inflation, partially offset by continued investments for growth. 

 ●On December 18, 2014, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Datamax-O’Neil, a global manufacturer of fixed and mobile printers used in a variety of retail, warehouse and distribution, and health care applications, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $185 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review.

 ●Sales for the fourth quarter were approximately flat reported, or up 3% on an organic basis, driven by higher UOP licensing sales, software and services growth in Process Solutions, and higher sales in Advanced Materials, particularly in Fluorine Products, offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and lower UOP catalyst sales. 

 ●Segment profit for the fourth quarter was up 6% and segment margins expanded 90 bps to 16.5% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher volume, the favorable impact of higher UOP licensing sales, and productivity net of inflation, partially offset by continued investments for growth.

Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (Unaudited) 

(Dollars in millions) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment. 

We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
