QUANTA SERVICES REPORTS 2014 FOURTH QUARTER AND ANNUAL RESULTS  

Revenues Increase 13% to $2.05 Billion  

Backlog Increases 12% to Record $9.76 Billion  

GAAP Diluted EPS of $0.30, Includes Charges  

Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.51  

HOUSTON – Feb. 19, 2015—Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2014. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $2.05 billion compared to revenues of $1.82 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $67.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014, versus net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $166.7 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (a non-GAAP measure) was $0.51 for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $0.50 for the fourth quarter of 2013.   

“Quanta had another strong year, with record revenues, record backlog and record adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continue to see opportunity for double digit growth as our customers in the electric power and oil and gas industries invest significant levels of capital to expand and upgrade energy infrastructure,” said Jim O’Neil, president and chief executive officer of Quanta Services. “With self-perform capabilities and the largest specialized workforce in our industry, we are able to provide unique solutions to the customers we serve, which is paramount in today’s energy infrastructure market.”  

Among other items, included in net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a $49.9 million ($30.3 million net of tax or $0.14 per diluted share) charge to provision for long-term contract receivable as a result of a settlement agreement with San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E), a subsidiary of Sempra Energy, regarding an outstanding change order dispute associated with an electric power infrastructure services project completed in 2012. For the fourth quarter of 2013, net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock included a $70.5 million after-tax gain, or approximately $0.32 per diluted share, from the sale of all of Quanta’s equity ownership interest in Howard Midstream Energy Partners, LLC (Howard Energy) on Dec. 6, 2013.

Revenues for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014 were $7.85 billion compared to revenues of $6.52 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $297.3 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014, versus net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $401.9 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.99 in 2014 compared to $1.71 in 2013.  

Among other items, included in net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014 was the impact of the previously mentioned settlement with SDG&E for an aggregate charge for the year to provision for long-term contract receivable of $102.5 million ($62.6 million net of tax or $0.28 per diluted share). Included in the results for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013 was the previously mentioned $70.5 million after-tax gain from the sale of all of Quanta’s equity ownership interest in Howard Energy.  

Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is calculated as GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before acquisition and integration costs, as well as non-cash items such as amortization of intangible assets and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods. See the attached table for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the reported GAAP measures.  

Quanta completed nine acquisitions during 2014. Therefore, the fourth quarter and 2014 year end results include these acquisitions from the respective acquisition dates and are compared to the pre-acquisition historical results of Quanta for the three and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2013.  

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS  

 •   Shares Repurchased—During the fourth quarter of 2014 and through Feb. 18, 2015, Quanta repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares of common stock in the open market for a total cost of approximately $230.5 million. Quanta’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2013 authorizing Quanta to purchase, from time to time through December 31, 2016, up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock. As of Feb. 18, 2015, Quanta had purchased an aggregate of approximately 9.7 million shares of common stock under this program for a total cost of approximately $275.5 million.

 •   Selected by Enbridge for Line 78 Pipeline Project—In February 2015, Enbridge selected Price Gregory International (Price Gregory), a Quanta Services company, for the Line 78 Pipeline Project (Line 78). Price Gregory’s scope of work includes the construction and installation of approximately 79 miles of new 36-inch diameter crude oil mainline pipe. In addition, Price Gregory was selected to build and install the pumping station for Line 78 at the Flanagan Terminal near Pontiac, Illinois and to make modifications to the terminal near Griffith, Indiana. Construction of the Flanagan pumping station and modifications of the Griffith terminal began in late 2014. Construction of the Line 78 pipeline is expected to begin this March with completion anticipated in the fall of 2015.  

 •   Selected for Fort McMurray West 500 kV Transmission Project—In December 2014, Alberta PowerLine, a limited partnership formed by Quanta Services and ATCO Group, was selected by the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) for the Fort McMurray West 500 Kilovolt (kV) Transmission Project under its newly created competitive transmission process. The Fort McMurray West 500 kV Transmission Project will consist of approximately 500 kilometers of transmission line between the Wabamun area west of Edmonton and the Fort McMurray area and two new 500 kV substations. Quanta will provide turnkey EPC services for the entire project. Led by Valard Construction, a Quanta Services company, the team will leverage the capabilities of a number of Quanta’s operating units. Quanta expects construction to begin in 2017 and expects to complete the project in 2019.  

 •   Acquired Banister Pipelines—In November 2014, Quanta Services acquired the business of Banister Pipelines Corp. (Banister), a leading Canadian mainline pipeline construction and maintenance services contractor based in Nisku, Alberta. The acquisition strategically expands Quanta’s Canadian mainline pipeline services offering across Canada and provides Banister’s customer base with access to Quanta’s extensive energy infrastructure resources.  

 •   Acquired three companies in the first two months of 2015—During the first two months of 2015, Quanta acquired three companies. These acquisitions included an underground utility distribution contractor that provides services to gas and electric utilities in Canada, a supplier and material procurement specialist for the power and utility industry in Canada, and a company that specializes in the engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning of compression and surface facilities for the Australian high pressure gas industry. The aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $36.3 million in cash, subject to post-closing net working capital adjustments.  

OUTLOOK  

The overall outlook for Quanta’s business is positive. However, regulatory, permitting and other challenges may impact project timing. Therefore, Quanta’s financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management’s efforts to properly align these uncertainties with the backlog the company is executing on and the opportunities expected to materialize during 2015. The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially.  

-MORE-  

Quanta expects revenues for the first quarter of 2015 to range between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion and diluted earnings per share to be $0.31 to $0.37. Quanta expects adjusted diluted earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure) for the first quarter of 2015 to be $0.37 to $0.43. This non-GAAP measure is estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in this press release. In the first quarter, Quanta is experiencing production inefficiencies on some projects in Canada and the northeast United States due to abnormally high levels of snowfall. Quanta anticipates that operating conditions and financial results will improve through the remaining quarters of the year. Amortization of intangibles and non-cash stock-based compensation expense are forecasted to be approximately $9.1 million and $11.5 million for the first quarter of 2015.  

Quanta expects revenues for the full year 2015 to range between $8.1 billion and $8.5 billion and diluted earnings per share to be $1.80 to $2.05. Quanta expects adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be $2.04 to $2.29. Amortization of intangibles and non-cash stock-based compensation expense are forecasted to be approximately $36.3 million and $43.1 million for the full year 2015.  

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The non-GAAP measures in this press release and on Quanta’s website are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta’s performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta’s operating results with those of its competitors. These measures should be used as an addition to, and not in lieu of, results prepared in conformity with GAAP. Reconciliations of other GAAP to non-GAAP measures not included in the table attached to this press release can be found on the company’s website at www.quantaservices.com in the “Investors & Media” section.

For the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013

Segment Results  

Quanta reports its results under three reporting segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services, (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services and (3) Fiber Optic Licensing and Other, as set forth below (in thousands, except percentages).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Included in operating income for the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment are charges to provision for long-term contract receivable associated with an electric power infrastructure services project completed in 2012 of $49.9 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2014 and of $102.5 million for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2014.  

 (b) Included in operating income for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2014 was the impact of a $38.8 million expense associated with an arbitration decision related to a contract dispute on a 2010 directional drilling project for the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago.  

 (c) Included in operating income for the Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment for the three and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2013 was $3.2 million of expense related to a change in Quanta’s assessment of gross receipts tax liabilities on certain fiber optic licensing revenues.  

Backlog  

Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); however, it is a common measurement used in the industry. Quanta’s methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies. Quanta’s backlog represents the amount of consolidated revenue that it expects to realize from future work under construction contracts, long-term maintenance contracts, master service agreements and licensing agreements. These estimates include revenues from the remaining portion of firm orders not yet completed and on which work has not yet begun, as well as revenues from change orders, renewal options, and funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent that they are reasonably expected to occur. For purposes of calculating backlog, Quanta includes 100% of estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities. The following tables present Quanta’s total backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, along with an estimate of the backlog amounts expected to be realized within 12 months of each balance sheet date (in millions):

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

For the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 

(In thousands, except per share information) (Unaudited)  

The non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is provided to enable investors to evaluate performance excluding the effects of items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between periods. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s acquisition activity, which can cause these amounts to vary from period to period; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, factors influencing the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted during the period; (iii) acquisition costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s acquisition activity ongoing during the period; and (iv) income tax contingency releases vary period to period depending on the level of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the expiration dates under various federal and state tax statute of limitations periods. Additionally, the following items are not regularly occurring operational items: (i) the charge to provision for long-term contract receivable; (ii) the expense associated with the arbitration decision; (iii) the gain on the sale of an equity ownership interest; and (iv) the charges associated with gross receipts tax.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) To eliminate the charges to provision for long-term contract receivable associated with an electric power infrastructure services project completed in 2012.  

 (b) To eliminate the expense recorded in the first quarter of 2014 resulting from an arbitration decision associated with a contract dispute on a 2010 directional drilling project.  

 (c) To eliminate the gain on sale by Quanta of its equity ownership interest in Howard Midstream Energy Partners, LLC for cash proceeds of approximately $221 million on Dec. 6, 2013.  

 (d) To eliminate tax benefits primarily associated with the expiration of various federal and state tax statute of limitations periods.  

 (e) To eliminate the impact of a revised assessment by Quanta of the applicability of state gross receipts tax requirements on its fiber optic licensing revenues as a result of an industry related legal proceeding.  

 (f) To eliminate non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 includes approximately $4.3 million related to the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards associated with the retirement of Quanta’s former chairman effective May 23, 2013.
