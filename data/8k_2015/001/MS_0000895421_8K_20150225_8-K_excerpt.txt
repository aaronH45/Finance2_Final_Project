Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 

On February 25, 2015, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, Civil Division (collectively, the “Civil Division”) to pay $2.6 billion to resolve certain claims that the Civil Division indicated it intended to bring against the Company.  

In connection with the resolution of this matter, the Company has, subsequent to the announcement of the Company’s 2014 earnings on January 20, 2015, increased legal reserves for this settlement and other legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters by approximately $2.8 billion, which increased Other expenses within the Institutional Securities business segment for year ended December 31, 2014. This decreased income from continuing operations by $2.7 billion and diluted EPS from continuing operations by $1.35 for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

While the Company and the Civil Division have reached an agreement in principle to resolve this matter, there can be no assurance that the Company and the Civil Division will agree on the final documentation of the settlement. 

The information furnished under Item 2.02 of this Report shall be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
