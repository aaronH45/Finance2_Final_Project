 Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement  

On February 25, 2015, Nielsen Finance LLC and Nielsen Finance Co. (the “Issuers”), indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Nielsen N.V. (the “Company”), issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of their 5.000% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “notes”), which mature on April 15, 2022, pursuant to an indenture, dated April 11, 2014 (the “Base Indenture”), among the Issuers, the Guarantors (as defined therein) and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented by the supplemental indenture, dated February 25, 2015, among the Issuers, the Guarantors (as defined therein) and the Trustee (the “Supplemental Indenture” and together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”). The notes are guaranteed by the Company, Valcon Acquisition B.V., The Nielsen Company B.V., VNU Intermediate Holding B.V. (“VNU”), Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. (together with VNU and the Issuers, the “Covenant Parties”) and, subject to certain exceptions, each of the direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. (other than the Issuers), in each case to the extent that such entity is a borrower or provides a guarantee under the Company’s senior secured credit agreements. The notes will trade interchangeably with the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% Senior Notes due 2022 and the $800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% Senior Notes due 2022 (collectively, the “existing notes”) issued by Nielsen Finance LLC and Nielsen Finance Co. on April 11, 2014 and July 8, 2014, respectively.  

The Issuers will pay interest on the notes at a rate of 5.000% per annum, semi-annually on interest payment dates as provided in the Indenture.  

Until April 15, 2017, the Issuers may, at their option, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes and the existing notes at a redemption price equal to 105.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof with the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings so long as at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes and the existing notes originally issued under the Indenture remains outstanding following any such redemption.  

The Indenture contains covenants that limit the Covenant Parties’ ability and the ability of the Covenant Parties’ restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: create liens on certain assets to secure debt; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets and enter into sale-leaseback transactions. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding notes and existing notes to be due and payable immediately.  

The foregoing descriptions of the notes and the Indenture do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Base Indenture, incorporated by reference to Exhibit 4.1 of the current report on Form 8-K of Nielsen N.V., filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 11, 2014, together with the Supplemental Indenture, attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.
