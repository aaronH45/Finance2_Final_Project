Exhibit 99.1

DANAHER REPORTS RECORD FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2014 RESULTS

WASHINGTON, D.C., January 27, 2015 -- Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. 

For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014, adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.04 on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects the adjustments identified in the attached reconciliation schedule. This represents an 8.3% increase over the comparable 2013 amount. On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the fourth quarter were $662 million, or $0.92 per share on a diluted basis. Revenues for the 2014 fourth quarter increased 3.0% to $5.4 billion with core revenues increasing 4.0%.

Net earnings for the full year 2014 were $2.6 billion, or $3.63 per share on a diluted basis. On a non-GAAP basis, which reflects the adjustments identified in the attached reconciliation schedule, full year 2014 adjusted diluted net earnings were $3.68 per share representing an increase of 7.6% over the comparable amount in 2013. Revenues for the full year 2014 increased 4.0% to $19.9 billion with core revenues increasing 3.5%. 

The Company anticipates that non-GAAP, adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter of 2015 will be in the range of $0.90 to $0.94. The Company is also updating its full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which is now expected to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40, reflecting the adjustments identified on the attached reconciliation schedule. The strengthening of the US dollar since December is expected to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.10 per share on a diluted basis. The Company anticipates offsetting $0.05 per share of this currency impact from savings associated with incremental fourth quarter 2014 productivity initiatives, recent acquisitions, and other actions. Core revenue for the full year 2015 is anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%.

Thomas P Joyce, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We delivered a strong finish to the year with core revenue growth exceeding our expectations. Our team executed well, using the tools of the Danaher Business System to gain market share while driving solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow generation. While cognizant of the current macroeconomic challenges, our investments in growth and productivity initiatives combined with a robust balance sheet give us confidence in our ability to outperform in 2015 and beyond.”

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share

We disclose the non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted net earnings per share, which refers to GAAP diluted net earnings per share, excluding the items identified in the reconciliation schedule above. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing aspects of Danaher’s operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, helps our investors to better understand the long-term profitability trends of our business, and facilitates easier comparisons of our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers. The items described above have been excluded from this measure because items of this nature and/or size occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher’s commercial performance during the period and/or we believe are not indicative of Danaher’s ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a given period.

The Company estimates the tax effect of the items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying the Company's overall estimated effective tax rate to the pre-tax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment.

Core Revenue and Core Revenue Growth 

We use the term “core revenue” or “sales from existing businesses” to refer to GAAP revenue from existing operations excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested product lines not considered discontinued operations (“acquisition sales”), and (2) the impact of 

currency translation. The portion of GAAP revenue from existing operations attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term “core revenue growth” to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue with the corresponding period of the prior year. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
