 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

Beginning with the reporting of its second quarter 2014 financial results, Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company (the “Company”) started providing certain financial metrics on an underlying basis. In calculating those financial metrics on an underlying basis, the prior period’s measures, other than earnings per share (“EPS”), were rebased to the current period using the average foreign currency exchange rates for each month in the period to remove the impact of foreign currency movements when comparing periods. Underlying EPS measures were treated differently. The current period underlying EPS excluded the year over year impact of foreign currency movements in order to assist comparability to EPS figures that have been disclosed in prior periods.  

Starting with the reporting of fourth quarter 2014 financial results, for purposes of conforming to all other underlying financial measures, the Company will report underlying EPS on a basis similar to all other underlying measures (i.e., the prior year EPS will be rebased to current period using the average foreign currency exchange rates for each month in the period to remove the impact of foreign currency movements when comparing periods).  

For illustrative purposes, Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto sets forth all quarterly reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information from 2011 through third quarter 2014 including the restated underlying EPS figures.
