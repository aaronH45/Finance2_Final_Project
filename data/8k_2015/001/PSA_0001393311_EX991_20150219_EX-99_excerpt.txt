 Public Storage Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2014   

 GLENDALE, California – Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014.   

 Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2014   

 For the three months ended December 31, 2014, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $284.0 million or $1.64 per diluted common share, compared to $243.7 million or $1.41 per diluted common share for the same period in 2013 representing an increase of $40.3 million or $0.23 per diluted common share. The increase is due to (i) a $41.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) our $36.5 million equity share of PS Business Parks’ (“PSB”) gain on sale of real estate included in our equity in earnings of real estate entities, offset partially by (iii) a $9.8 million increase in earnings allocated to preferred shareholders due to the issuance of additional preferred shares and (iv) a $7.8 million reduction associated with foreign currency exchange gains and losses.    

 The $41.3 million increase in our self-storage net operating income is a result of a $23.2 million increase for our Same Store Facilities and an $18.1 million increase for our non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 5.6% or $24.9 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 1.6% or $1.7 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to increases in advertising and selling expense. The increase in net operating income for the non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of the acquisition of 165 self-storage facilities since January 2013.   

 Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2014   

 For the year ended December 31, 2014, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $908.2 million or $5.25 per diluted common share, compared to $844.7 million or $4.89 per diluted common share for the same period in 2013, representing an increase of $63.5 million or $0.36 per diluted common share. This increase is due primarily to (i) a $157.2 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) our $36.5 million equity share of PSB’s gain on sale of real estate included in our equity in earnings of real estate entities, offset partially by (iii) a $49.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense associated with acquired facilities, (iv) a $24.1 million reduction associated with foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (v) an $28.3 million increase in earnings allocated to preferred shareholders due to the issuance of additional preferred shares and (vi) a $17.7 million decrease in interest and other income due primarily to the disposition of 51% of our loan receivable from Shurgard Europe.   

 The $157.2 million increase in our self-storage net operating income is a result of an $84.0 million increase for our Same Store Facilities and a $73.2 million increase for our non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 5.4% or $93.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 1.9% or $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to increases in property tax expense and snow removal costs, offset partially by lower on-site property manager payroll expense. The increase in net operating income for the non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of the acquisition of 165 self-storage facilities since January 2013.

 Funds from Operations  

 For the three months ended December 31, 2014, funds from operations (“FFO”) was $2.17 per diluted common share, as compared to $2.13 for the same period in 2013, representing an increase of $0.04 per share. FFO is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation, gains and losses and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2014, FFO was $7.98 per diluted common share, as compared to $7.53 for the same period in 2013, representing an increase of $0.45 per share.   

 We also present “Core FFO per share,” a non-GAAP measure that represents FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses and (ii) certain other items such as legal settlements, recognition of deferred tax assets, costs associated with the acquisition of real estate facilities and facility closure charges. We believe Core FFO per share is a helpful measure used by investors and REIT analysts to understand our performance. However, Core FFO per share is not a substitute for net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such a measure, Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.  

 The following table reconciles from FFO per share to Core FFO per share (unaudited):

 Property Operations – Same Store Facilities  

 The Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2012 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2013 and 2014. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,982 facilities (125.4 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 87% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2014.

   (a)    Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales. 

   (b)    See attached reconciliation of Same Store net operating income (“NOI”) to operating income.  

   (c)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.  

   (d)    Contract rent represents the applicable contractual monthly rent charged to our tenants, excluding the impact of promotional discounts, late charges and administrative fees.

Shurgard Europe Same Store Selected Operating Data  

 The Shurgard Europe Same Store Pool represents Shurgard Europe’s 174 facilities (9.2 million net rentable square feet) that have been operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2012 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2013 and 2014. These 174 facilities represent approximately 89% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of Shurgard Europe’s self-storage portfolio. Our pro-rata share of the operating results for these facilities is included in “equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities” on our income statement.

   (b)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins.

   (b)    Net operating income or “NOI” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. We believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, in evaluating property performance and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. This table reconciles from NOI for our self-storage facilities to the operating income presented on our income statement.
