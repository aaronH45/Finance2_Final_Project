  2015 Executive Annual Incentive Plan

On February 11, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the 2015 Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan"), a cash bonus plan in which the Company’s executive officers participate (including the "named executive officers" as defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended). Under the 2015 Plan, each executive officer has an individual incentive target which is expressed as a percentage of base salary. Incentive target percentages for certain executive officers participating in the 2015 Plan are as follows: 

• Rami Rahim: 175%

• Robyn Denholm: 150%

• Pradeep Sindhu: 100%

• Vincent Molinaro: 100%

Under the 2015 Plan, the aggregate pool for executive cash bonuses will be funded if a specified threshold operating income target is achieved. Provided the operating income target is reached, the actual incentive amounts paid under the 2015 Plan after the end of 2015 will depend on the level of achievement of the following objectives:

• 70% based on the Company’s non-GAAP operating margin and revenue growth; and

• 30% based on achievement of other specified strategic goals. 

The aggregate 2015 Plan payout will range between zero and 200%; individual payouts will be determined based on individual performance and will range between zero and 200%.

2014 Executive Annual Incentive Plan

The Compensation Committee also approved cash incentive compensation payouts under the 2014 Annual Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") for certain executive officers for fiscal year 2014 as follows. The cash incentive compensation payouts noted below represent approximately 81% of the executive officer’s respective incentive target opportunity. Further disclosure regarding the 2014 Plan and these payments will be contained in the Company’s proxy statement for its 2015 annual meeting of stockholders.

• Rami Rahim: $1,200,068

• Robyn Denholm: $909,000

• Pradeep Sindhu: $484,800

• Vincent Molinaro: $454,500

2015 Executive Officer Base Salaries and Equity Compensation

As part of its annual executive compensation review, on February 11, 2015, the Compensation Committee considered the annual base salaries of the Company’s executive officers. The annual base salaries for the executive officers listed below were unchanged and are as follows:

• Rami Rahim: $1,000,000

• Robyn Denholm: $750,000

• Pradeep Sindhu: $600,000

• Vincent Molinaro: $575,000

Also as part of its annual executive compensation review, the Compensation Committee approved equity awards for named executive officers to be granted on March 20, 2015. These equity awards are comprised of four types of awards: (i) performance shares that vest based on achievement of performance objectives, (ii) performance share awards that vest based on appreciation of the price of the Company’s common stock over a multi-year period, (iii) service-based RSUs that vest in three annual tranches, and (iv) RSUs that vest over a two year period based on achievement of a 2015 operating income target. 

Departure of Director
