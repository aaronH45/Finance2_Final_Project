Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

Waste Management, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release this morning announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2014, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The Company is holding a conference call to discuss these results beginning at 9:00 a.m. Central Time this morning. The call will be webcast live and may be heard by accessing the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.wm.com. The call may also be heard by dialing (877) 710-6139 and entering access code 64356817. To access a replay telephonically, please dial (855) 859-2056 and use the replay conference ID number 64356817.  

On the call, management of the Company is expected to discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures that are included in the Company’s press release. The Company has provided information regarding its use of the non-GAAP measures contained in its press release and reconciliations of such measures to their most comparable GAAP measures.  

In addition to the non-GAAP measures contained and reconciled in the press release, management is also expected to discuss adjusted income from operations, adjusted income from operations as a percent of revenue, adjusted operating EBITDA, adjusted operating EBITDA as a percent of revenue, further adjusted full year SG&A expenses, and further adjusted full year SG&A expenses as a percent of revenues. Each of these non-GAAP measures excludes certain items noted in the table below. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are helpful to investors evaluating the Company’s performance because certain non-cash costs and other items that management believes are not representative of our performance or indicative of our results of operations are excluded. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are shown below.  

The Company defines operating EBITDA as income from operations before depreciation and amortization; this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses this non-GAAP measure as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance and ability to pay dividends, fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and other investments and, in the absence of refinancing, to repay debt obligations. Adjusted operating EBTIDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, income from operations or net cash provided by operating activities.
