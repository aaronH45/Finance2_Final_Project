On January 19, 2015, the Honorable Leon Panetta accepted an offer to join the Board of Directors of Oracle Corporation. Mr. Panetta is not currently expected to join any committees of the Board.  

Pursuant to our Amended and Restated 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan, on January 19, 2015, Mr. Panetta was automatically granted a stock option to purchase 15,000 shares of our common stock. This stock option represents a pro rata amount of 45,000 shares based on the number of complete calendar months remaining in our fiscal year, and will vest 25% per year over four years. Commencing May 31, 2015, he will be eligible to receive our annual stock grant for non-employee directors. Mr. Panetta will also receive the standard cash compensation for our non-employee directors, as described in more detail in our most recent proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 23, 2014.  

Mr. Panetta is expected to enter into our standard form of indemnification agreement pursuant to which we will indemnify him for certain actions he takes in his capacity as a director.
