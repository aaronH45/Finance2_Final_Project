For the year, the Company reported net income of $498.9 million, or $1.45 per share, which includes a negative impact of $0.16 per share from MEGA Brands acquisition and integration costs2 and a tax benefit of $0.13 per share, compared to net income of $903.9 million, or $2.58 per share, in 2013, which included a tax benefit of $0.09. Worldwide net sales were $6.02 billion, down 7%, including an unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of 2% percentage points, compared to $6.48 billion last year.

The Company’s debt-to-total capital ratio as of December 31, 2014 was 41.6%.
