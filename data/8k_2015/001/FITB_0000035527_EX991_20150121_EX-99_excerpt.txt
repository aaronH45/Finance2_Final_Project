“Fifth Third reported full year net income available to common shareholders of $1.4 billion and earnings per diluted share were $1.66. Full year 2014 earnings included solid performance across our business lines highlighted by growth in corporate banking, payments processing, and investment advisory revenue,” said Kevin T. Kabat, Vice Chairman and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. “Highlights for the year also included 7 percent growth in demand deposits and well-controlled expenses that were down 6 percent. Return on average assets was 1.1 percent and return on average tangible common equity* was 12.2 percent.  

“Fourth quarter earnings of $385 million rounded out a solid year in a very tough operating environment. Average total deposits were up 3 percent sequentially, highlighted by 5 percent average demand deposit growth. Fee income comparisons were led by corporate banking which increased 20 percent sequentially, led by strong results in capital markets fees to close out the year. We continue to make what we believe to be long-term value enhancing decisions when we deploy our shareholders’ equity and maintain our focus on earnings growth as we anticipate a healthier economy in 2015.

“Full year net charge-offs were impacted by our decision to move $720 million of residential mortgage TDRs to held-for-sale, as we look to take advantage of market conditions to reduce our TDR portfolio. This decision increased our charge-offs by $87 million. The intended transaction is in line with our previous statements about our view of the current pricing for risk assets and is another indication of our strong focus to reduce the volatility of our future earnings. Otherwise in credit, nonperforming assets were down 24 percent from last year and remain at very low levels. Our credit metrics are moving in the right direction and provide further support to our positive credit outlook.  

“We continued to prudently and actively manage our capital position, reducing our share count by another 4 percent in 2014. Fifth Third performed very well in 2014, and we made a number of decisions throughout the year to reduce risk and volatility of earnings, and we feel the Company is well positioned as we enter 2015.”  

Income Statement Highlights  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

4  

Net Interest Income  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net interest income of $888 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased $20 million from the third quarter primarily driven by the effects of loan repricing and higher interest expense associated with the debt issuance in the third quarter of 2014 and partially offset by the benefit of loan growth. Additionally, net interest income was negatively impacted by lower average investment securities balances and higher deposit costs in the quarter.  

The net interest margin was 2.96 percent, a decrease of 14 bps from the previous quarter primarily resulting from elevated cash balances due to growth in funding balances. Additionally, the net interest margin was negatively impacted by debt issuances and loan repricing during the quarter.  

Compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, net interest income decreased $17 million and the net interest margin decreased 25 bps. The decrease in net interest income was driven by the effect of loan repricing and higher interest expense resulting from increased long-term debt balances partially offset by higher investment securities balances and loan balances. The decline in the net interest margin was primarily driven by the impact of loan repricing.  

Securities  

Average securities and other short-term investments were $27.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $24.9 billion in the previous quarter and $23.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Average securities of $22.4 billion decreased $216 million from the prior quarter reflecting the decision to not reinvest portfolio cash flows. Other short-term investments average balances of $5.2 billion increased $2.9 billion sequentially while end of period balances increased $4.3 billion reflecting higher cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.

Loans  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average loan and lease balances (excluding loans held-for-sale) increased $242 million sequentially and increased $3.1 billion, or 4 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2013. The sequential increase in average loans and leases was primarily driven by growth in commercial construction and residential mortgage loans. Sequential growth was partially offset by declines in commercial and industrial (C&I), commercial mortgage, and home equity loans. Period end loans and leases (excluding loans held-for-sale) of $90.1 billion decreased $540 million sequentially, reflecting the impact of $720 million residential mortgage loans classified as troubled debt restructurings transferred to held-for-sale during the quarter, and increased $1.5 billion, or 2 percent, from a year ago.  

Average commercial portfolio loan and lease balances were flat sequentially and increased $2.9 billion, or 6 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2013. Average C&I loans decreased $200 million from the prior quarter and increased $2.4 billion from the fourth quarter of 2013. Within commercial real estate, average commercial mortgage balances continued to decline and average commercial construction balances increased for the eighth consecutive quarter.

Period end loans held-for-sale of $1.3 billion increased $620 million from the previous quarter and $317 million from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to the transfer of certain residential mortgage loans classified as troubled debt restructurings to held-for-sale.  

Deposits  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Includes commercial customer Eurodollar sweep balances for which the Bancorp pays rates comparable to other commercial deposit accounts.  

Average core deposits increased $3.2 billion sequentially and increased $7.1 billion, or 8 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2013. Average transaction deposits increased $3.1 billion from the third quarter of 2014 primarily driven by higher money market account, demand deposit, and interest checking balances, partially offset by lower savings and foreign office balances. Year-over-year transaction deposits increased $6.7 billion, or 8 percent, driven by higher money market account, demand deposit, and interest checking balances, partially offset by lower savings and foreign office balances. Other time deposits increased 4 percent sequentially and 12 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2013.  

Average commercial transaction deposits increased 5 percent sequentially and 10 percent from the previous year. Sequential performance reflected higher demand deposit, money market account, and interest checking balances, partially offset by lower foreign office balances.

Wholesale Funding  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average wholesale funding of $19.5 billion decreased $292 million, or 1 percent, sequentially and increased $426 million, or 2 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. The sequential decrease was driven by a decrease in other short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, and certificates $100,000 and over, partially offset by an increase in long-term debt. Average other short-term borrowings decreased $492 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a decrease in FHLB borrowings. The year-over-year increase in average wholesale funding reflected an increase in long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in certificates $100,000 and over and other short-term borrowings. Average long-term debt balances reflected the $1.0 billion on-balance sheet auto securitization executed in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well as the full quarter impact of $850 million of bank senior debt issued in the third quarter of 2014.  

Noninterest Income  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest income of $653 million increased $133 million sequentially and decreased $50 million compared with prior year results. These comparisons reflect the impacts described below.  

For the quarters ending December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the impacts of Vantiv warrant valuation adjustments were positive $56 million, negative $53 million, and positive $91 million, respectively. Quarterly results also included charges related to the valuation of the total return swap entered into as part of the 2009 sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. Valuation adjustments on this swap were a negative $19 million, negative $3 million, and negative $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, the third quarter of 2014, and the fourth quarter of 2013, respectively. Excluding these items and net securities gains in all periods, noninterest income of $612 million increased $39 million, or 7 percent,  

8  

 from the previous quarter and decreased $16 million, or 3 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2013. The sequential increase was primarily due to the $23 million annual payment received from Vantiv pursuant to the tax receivable agreement in the fourth quarter of 2014 and an increase in corporate banking revenue. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower mortgage banking net revenue partially offset by higher corporate banking revenue and higher payments received from Vantiv pursuant to the tax receivable agreement in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, which were $23 million and $9 million, respectively.  

Service charges on deposits of $142 million decreased 2 percent from the third quarter and were flat compared with the same quarter last year. The sequential decline was due to a 2 percent decrease in commercial service charges as well as a 2 percent decrease in retail service charges due to lower overdraft occurrences.  

Corporate banking revenue of $120 million increased 20 percent from the third quarter of 2014 and 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013. The sequential increase was due to higher syndication fees, business lending fees, and foreign exchange fees, partially offset by a decrease in institutional sales revenue. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher syndication fees, lease remarketing fees, letter of credit fees, and foreign exchange fees, partially offset by a decrease in institutional sales revenue.  

Mortgage banking net revenue was $61 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, flat from the third quarter of 2014 and a 51 percent decrease from the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 originations were $1.7 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in the previous quarter and $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 originations resulted in gains of $36 million on mortgages sold, compared with gains of $34 million during the previous quarter and $60 million during the fourth quarter of 2013. The sequential increase was driven by higher gain on sale margins, partially offset by lower production. The decrease from the prior year reflected lower production, including Fifth Third’s exit from the broker channel, partially offset by higher gain on sale margins. Mortgage servicing fees were $60 million this quarter, $61 million in the third quarter of 2014, and $64 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Mortgage banking net revenue is also affected by net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include mortgage servicing rights (MSR) amortization and MSR valuation adjustments (including mark-to-market adjustments on free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio). These net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 (reflecting MSR amortization of $32 million and MSR valuation adjustments of negative $2 million); negative $34 million in the third quarter of 2014 (MSR amortization of $33 million and MSR valuation adjustments of negative $1 million); and positive $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 (MSR amortization of $23 million and MSR valuation adjustments of positive $26 million). The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $856 million at quarter-end on a servicing portfolio of $65 billion.  

Investment advisory revenue of $100 million decreased 2 percent from the third quarter and increased 2 percent year-over-year. The sequential decline reflected a decrease in personal specialty and insurance fees relative to elevated levels in the third quarter, as well as a decrease in securities and brokerage fees due to a continued shift from transaction-based fees to recurring revenue streams. The year-over-year increase reflected an increase in personal asset management fees due to market-related growth, partially offset by a decrease in securities and brokerage fees.  

9  

Card and processing revenue of $76 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 2 percent sequentially and increased 7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013. The sequential and year-over-year increases reflect an increase in the number of actively used cards and an increase in customer spend volume.  

Other noninterest income totaled $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $33 million in the previous quarter and $170 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. As previously described, the results included the impact of Vantiv warrant valuation adjustments and charges related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap. Excluding these items, other noninterest income of $113 million increased approximately $24 million, or 27 percent, from the third quarter of 2014 and increased approximately $16 million, or 16 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2013. The sequential and year-over-year increases were primarily due to payments received from Vantiv pursuant to the tax receivable agreement of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

Net gains on investment securities were $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $3 million in the previous quarter and $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

Noninterest Expense  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth quarter 2014 expenses included a $3 million reversal of litigation reserves, compared with $4 million in charges to litigation reserves in the third quarter of 2014 and $69 million in charges to litigation reserves in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 expenses also included $6 million in severance expense compared with $2 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter of 2013 also included $8 million of debt extinguishment costs associated with the redemption of Fifth Third Capital Trust IV and an $8 million contribution to Fifth Third Foundation. Excluding these items, noninterest expense of $915 million was up $33 million, or 4 percent, sequentially and increased $19 million, or 2 percent, year-over-year. The sequential increase reflected higher credit-related costs and compensation-related expense. The year-over-year increase reflected increased credit-related costs, partially offset by lower compensation-related expense, primarily due to changes in our mortgage and retail staffing.  

10  

Credit costs related to problem assets recorded as noninterest expense totaled $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $13 million in the third quarter of 2014, and a benefit of $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Capital Position  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) The tangible equity, tangible common equity, tier I common equity and tangible book value per share ratios, while not required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), are considered to be critical metrics with which to analyze banks. The ratios have been included herein to facilitate a greater understanding of the Bancorp’s capital structure and financial condition. See the Regulation G Non-GAAP Reconciliation table for a reconciliation of these ratios to U.S. GAAP.  

 (b) Under the banking agencies risk-based capital guidelines, assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is multiplied by the associated risk weight of the category. The resulting weighted values are added together resulting in the Bancorp’s total risk weighted assets.  

 (c) Current period regulatory capital data ratios are estimated.  

Capital ratios remained strong during the quarter, reflecting growth in retained earnings, the payment of preferred dividends, and share repurchase activity. Compared with the prior quarter, the Tier 1 common equity ratio* of 9.65 percent increased 1 bp. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio* was 8.43 percent (excluding unrealized gains/losses) and 8.71 percent (including unrealized gains/losses). The Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.83 percent and was flat compared to the prior quarter. The total risk-based capital ratio decreased 1 bps to 14.33 percent and the Leverage ratio decreased 16 bps to 9.66 percent.  

Our current estimate of the pro-forma fully phased in Tier I common equity ratio at December 31, 2014 under the final capital rule, assuming the Company elected to maintain the current treatment of AOCI components in capital, would be approximately 9.4 percent**. This would compare with 9.7 percent* as calculated under the currently prevailing Basel I capital framework. Were Fifth Third to make the election to include AOCI components in capital, the December 31, 2014 pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio would be increased by approximately 35 bps. Fifth Third’s pro forma Tier 1 common equity ratio exceeds the minimum buffered Tier 1 common equity ratio of 7 percent, comprising a minimum of 4.5 percent plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent. The pro forma Tier 1 common equity ratio does not include the effect of any mitigating actions the Bancorp may undertake to offset any impact of the final capital rules.  

 * Non-GAAP measure; see Reg. G reconciliation on page 33.  

 ** Capital ratios estimated; presented under current U.S. capital regulations. The pro forma Basel III Tier I common equity ratio is management’s estimate based upon its current interpretation of the Basel III Final Rule approved in July 2013.  

15  

Book value per share at December 31, 2014 was $17.35 and tangible book value per share* was $14.40, compared with the September 30, 2014 book value per share of $16.87 and tangible book value per share of $13.95.  

As previously announced, Fifth Third entered into a share repurchase agreement with a counterparty on October 20, 2014, whereby Fifth Third would purchase approximately $180 million of its outstanding common stock. This transaction reduced Fifth Third’s fourth quarter share count by 8.34 million shares on October 23, 2014. Settlement of the forward contract related to this agreement occurred on January 5, 2015 and an additional 0.79 million shares were repurchased upon completion of the agreement. In addition, the settlement of the forward contract related to the July 21, 2014 $225 million share repurchase agreement occurred on October 14, 2014. An additional 1.90 million shares were repurchased upon completion of the agreement. In total, the incremental impact to the average diluted share count in the fourth quarter of 2014 was approximately 10.53 million shares due to share repurchase transactions in the third and fourth quarters of 2014.  

Tax Rate  

The effective tax rate was 25.9 percent this quarter compared with 26.7 percent in the third quarter of 2014 and 28.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

Other  

Fifth Third Bank owns 43 million units representing a 22.8 percent interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC, convertible into shares of Vantiv, Inc., a publicly traded firm (NYSE: VNTV).

Next month in our 10-K, we will update our disclosure of the carrying value of our interest in Vantiv stock, which was $388 million as of September 30, 2014. The difference between the market value and the book value of Fifth Third’s interest in Vantiv’s shares is not recognized in Fifth Third’s equity or capital. Additionally, Fifth Third has a warrant to purchase additional shares in Vantiv which is carried as a derivative asset at a fair value of $415 million as of December 31, 2014.
