BNY Mellon Announces Adjustment to Fourth Quarter 2014 Financial Results

Records Additional $598 Million After-Tax Litigation Expense

For Anticipated Resolution of Previously Disclosed Matters

New York, February 17, 2015 - The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE: BK) today announced that it is adjusting its financial results for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014 to include an additional after-tax litigation expense of $598 million in anticipation of the resolution of several previously disclosed matters, including substantially all of the foreign exchange-related actions. As a result, BNY Mellon expects that there will be a significant decline in the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses for legal proceedings for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014.

BNY Mellon is adjusting its fourth quarter financial results to net income of $209 million or $0.18 per share in recognition of the after-tax litigation expense. The Company’s amended and restated earnings release for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014 reflecting these adjustments is below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled $151 million in 4Q14 compared with $146 million in 4Q13 and $153 million in 3Q14. In 4Q14, foreign exchange revenue totaled $165 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Both increases reflect higher volumes and volatility, partially offset by lower Depositary Receipts-related activity. 

Other trading loss was $14 million in 4Q14, compared with other trading revenue of $20 million in 4Q13 and other trading loss of $1 million in 3Q14. Both decreases primarily reflect lower fixed income derivatives trading revenue due to exiting the derivatives sales and trading business and losses on hedging activities within one of the Investment Management boutiques, partially offset by the positive impact of interest rate hedging (which is offset in net interest revenue).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investment and other income was $78 million in 4Q14 compared with a loss of $43 million in 4Q13 and income of $890 million in 3Q14. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects a loss related to an equity investment recorded in 4Q13 and lower seed capital gains. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the gains on the sales of our equity investment in Wing Hang Bank and our One Wall Street building, both recorded in 3Q14.

KEY POINTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

- The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from lower asset yields, higher premium amortization on agency mortgage backed securities, lower accretion and the impact of interest rate hedging (which is primarily offset in foreign exchange and other trading revenue). The decrease was partially offset by a change in the mix of assets and higher average interest-earning assets driven by higher deposits. 

- The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the impact of interest rate hedging of approximately $13 million (which is primarily offset in foreign exchange and other trading revenue) and lower accretion. 

•In the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed our plan to reduce interbank placement assets and increase our high quality liquid assets in the securities portfolio.

KEY POINTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

- Both comparisons primarily reflect lower staff expense, the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower asset-based taxes, partially offset by higher professional, legal and other purchased services. 

--The decrease in staff expense primarily reflects lower headcount as a result of streamlining actions, the benefit of replacing technology contractors with permanent staff and lower healthcare costs.

--The increase in professional, legal and other purchased services was driven by higher expenses related to the implementation of strategic platforms. 

- The year-over-year decrease also reflects lower business development expense as a result of discretionary expense control. 

- The sequential decrease was partially offset by higher business development expense due to seasonality and higher legal fees.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

At Dec. 31, 2014, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $119.1 billion. The net unrealized pre-tax gain on our total securities portfolio was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2014 compared with $1.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2014. The increase in the net unrealized pre-tax gain was primarily driven by a decline in market interest rates. During 4Q14, we received $115 million of paydowns of sub-investment grade securities and sold $116 million of sub-investment grade available-for-sale securities. 

The following table shows the distribution of our investment securities portfolio.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Nonperforming assets were $128 million at Dec. 31, 2014, a decrease of $19 million from $147 million at Sept. 30, 2014. The decrease primarily resulted from repayments in the commercial and other residential mortgage portfolios and charges-offs in the commercial real estate portfolio.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PROVISION AND NET CHARGE-OFFS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The allowance for credit losses was $280 million at Dec. 31, 2014, a decrease of $8 million compared with $288 million at Sept. 30, 2014. The decrease primarily reflects charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio.

CAPITAL

Our consolidated capital ratios are shown in the following table. At Sept. 30, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2014, the common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”), Tier 1 and Total risk-based regulatory capital ratios are based on Basel III components of capital, as phased-in, and asset risk-weightings using the Advanced Approach framework under the final rules released by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) on July 2, 2013 (the “Final Capital Rules”). The leverage capital ratios for Sept. 30, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2014 are based on Basel III components of capital and quarterly average total assets, as phased-in. The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for Dec. 31, 2013 are based on Basel I rules (including Basel I Tier 1 common in the case of the CET1 ratio).

(a)Dec. 31, 2014 consolidated regulatory capital ratios are preliminary. See “Capital Ratios” beginning on page 29 for more detail.

(b)Risk-based capital ratios at Sept. 30, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2014 include the net impact of including the total consolidated assets of certain consolidated investment management funds in risk-weighted assets. These assets were not included in the Dec. 31, 2013 risk-based ratios. The leverage capital ratio was not impacted. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Impact of Adopting New Accounting Guidance

In the first quarter of 2014, BNY Mellon elected to early adopt the new accounting guidance included in Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-01, “Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects - a Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.” This ASU allows companies that invest in qualified affordable housing projects to elect the proportional amortization method of accounting for these investments, if certain conditions are met. In the first quarter of 2014, we restated the prior period financial statements to reflect the impact of the retrospective application of the new accounting guidance.

BNY Mellon 4Q14 Earnings Release

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION – EXPLANATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Release certain Non-GAAP financial measures based on fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios, SLR, Basel I CET1 and tangible common shareholders’ equity. BNY Mellon believes that the Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, the SLR on a fully phased-in basis, the ratio of Basel I CET1 to risk-weighted assets and the ratio of tangible common shareholders’ equity to tangible assets of operations are measures of capital strength that provide additional useful information to investors, supplementing the capital ratios which are, or were, utilized by regulatory authorities. The tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio includes changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in total shareholders’ equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its reconciliation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes and the assets of consolidated investment management funds to which BNY Mellon has limited economic exposure. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income. BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of such assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding.

BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures which exclude the effect of noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds, a gain on the sale of our investment in Wing Hang Bank, a gain on the sale of the One Wall Street building, and a loss related to an equity investment; and expense measures which exclude M&I expenses, litigation charges, restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets and the charge (recovery) related to investment management funds, net of incentives. Earnings per share, return on equity measures and operating margin measures, which exclude some or all of these items, are also presented. Earnings per share and return on equity measures also exclude the tax benefit primarily related to a tax carryback claim and the net charge related to the disallowance of certain foreign tax credits. Operating margin measures may also exclude amortization of intangible assets and the net negative impact of money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period-to-period comparisons, which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon’s control. The excluded items, in general, relate to certain ongoing charges as a result of prior transactions or where we have incurred charges. M&I expenses primarily relate to acquisitions and generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction. M&I expenses can vary on a year-to-year basis depending on the stage of the integration. BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion of M&I expenses provides investors with a focus on BNY Mellon’s business as it would appear on a consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I expenses have ceased. Future periods will not reflect such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily compared to our current results if M&I expenses are excluded. Litigation charges represent accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees. Restructuring charges relate to our streamlining actions, Operational Excellence Initiatives and migrating positions to Global Delivery Centers. Excluding these charges permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with how management views the business. 

The presentation of income from consolidated investment management funds, net of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related to the consolidation of certain investment management funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with how management views the business. BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, give investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses. 

In this Earnings Release, the net interest margin is presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business-level basis.

Capital Ratios

BNY Mellon has presented its estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and SLR based on its interpretation of the Final Capital Rules, which are being gradually phased-in over a multi-year period, as supplemented by the Federal Reserve’s final rules concerning the SLR published on Sept. 3, 2014, and on the application of such rules to BNY Mellon’s businesses as currently conducted. Management views the estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and SLR as key measures in monitoring BNY Mellon’s capital position and progress against future regulatory capital standards. Additionally, the presentation of the estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and SLR are intended to allow investors to compare these ratios with estimates presented by other companies. The estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios assume all relevant regulatory approvals. The Final Capital Rules require approval by banking regulators of certain models used as part of risk-weighted asset calculations. If these models are not approved, the estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios would likely be adversely impacted. 

Risk-weighted assets at Sept. 30, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2014 for credit risk under the transitional Advanced Approach do not reflect the use of a simple value-at-risk methodology for repo-style transactions (including agented indemnified securities lending transactions), eligible margin loans, and similar transactions. BNY Mellon has requested written approval to use this methodology.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things, BNY Mellon’s further review of applicable rules, anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of risk-weighted asset calculations, other refinements, further implementation guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any changes BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. Consequently, our capital ratios remain subject to ongoing review and revision and may change based on these factors.

The following are the primary differences between risk-weighted assets determined under fully phased-in Basel III-Standardized Approach and Basel I. Credit risk is determined under Basel I using predetermined risk-weights and 

Page - 29

BNY Mellon 4Q14 Earnings Release

asset classes and relies in part on the use of external credit ratings. Under fully phased-in Basel III, the Standardized Approach uses a broader range of predetermined risk-weights and asset classes and certain alternatives to external credit ratings. Securitization exposure receives a higher risk-weighting under fully phased-in Basel III than Basel I, and fully phased-in Basel III includes additional adjustments for market risk, counterparty credit risk and equity exposures. Additionally, the Standardized Approach eliminates the use of the VaR approach, whereas the Advanced Approach permits the VaR approach but requires certain model qualifications and approvals, for determining risk-weighted assets on certain repo-style transactions. In 2014, Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach risk-weighted assets include transitional adjustments for intangible assets, other than goodwill, and equity exposure.

The following table presents the reconciliation of our estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio under the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Dec. 31, 2014 information is preliminary. 

(b)Tier 1 capital at Dec. 31, 2013 is based on Basel I rules. Tier 1 capital at Sept. 30, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2014 are based on Basel III rules, as phased-in.

(c)Risk-based capital ratios at Sept. 30, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2014 include the net impact of including the total consolidated assets of certain consolidated investment management funds in risk-weighted assets. These assets were not included in the Dec. 31, 2013 risk-based ratios.
