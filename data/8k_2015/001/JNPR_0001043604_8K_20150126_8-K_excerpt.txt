Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On January 27, 2015, Juniper Networks, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our” or “the Company”) issued a press release (the “press release”) in which we announced preliminary financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed as “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.  

Item 2.06 Material Impairments.  

On January 26, 2015, the Company concluded that a material impairment charge was required to the carrying value of the Company’s Security reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge estimated at $850 million and reduced the carrying value of goodwill for its Security reporting unit for the year ending December 31, 2014. No cash expenditures are expected from the impairment charge. There were several factors that contributed to this impairment, including the underperformance of the Security reporting unit in 2014 as well as the change in the Company’s security strategy and product rationalizations. Combined, these factors have resulted in a delay in achieving the Company’s revenue and profit forecasts for the Security reporting unit needed to support the historical carrying value of the Security reporting unit’s goodwill valuation.
