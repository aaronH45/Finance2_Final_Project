NEW YORK, February 10, 2015 – Willis Group Holdings plc (NYSE: WSH), the global risk advisor, insurance and reinsurance broker, today reported results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.  

Dominic Casserley, Willis Group Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We finished 2014 with strong top-line growth driven by both another quarter of mid-single digit organic growth in commissions and fees and the impact of our recent acquisitions. We continued to make good progress on managing our organic cost growth and implementing our Operational Improvement Program. We achieved all this despite some ongoing challenging markets, demonstrating the strength of Willis’ diversified business model and our intense focus on executing our strategy. Importantly, we delivered growth in key underlying earnings metrics, including EPS, EBITDA and operating margin.  

“We continued to reshape Willis to improve earnings, both organically and through acquisition. During the quarter, we welcomed new colleagues from Max Matthiessen, SurePoint Reinsurance, and IFG into Willis and, early in 2015, reached an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Miller Insurance Services.”

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Underlying measures exclude the impact of certain adjusting items and period over period foreign exchange movements.

Please refer to supplemental financial information attached to this press release for detailed definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and accompanying reconciliations.  

Fourth Quarter 2014 Financial Results  

Willis Group reported net income of $76 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to net income of $68 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. Items which affected the year-on-year movement in net income included restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program of $0.06 per diluted share, unfavorable foreign currency movements of $0.03 per diluted share, and a gain on disposal of operations of $0.02 per diluted share.  

Underlying diluted EPS were $0.46 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014, up 17.9% compared to $0.39 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

Revenues  

Total reported commissions and fees increased 3.1% to $939 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, from $911 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Total commissions and fees growth included $35 million of unfavorable foreign currency movements, and a $32 million net increase in commissions and fees from acquisitions and disposals.  

2  

Underlying commissions and fees, which exclude the net impact of foreign currency movements, grew 7.2%.  

Organic commissions and fees, which exclude both the net impact of foreign currency movements and the net impact of acquisitions and disposals, grew 3.6%, driven by strong growth in Willis International (see Segment Revenue Results below).  

Other income was $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $11 million from the prior year period. The increase reflected a $12 million settlement related to a specialty book of business within the Global segment.  

Expenses  

Total Expenses  

On a reported basis, total expenses increased 5.8% to $819 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, from $774 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Total reported expense growth included $16 million of restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program, $24 million of favorable foreign currency movements, and a $33 million net increase in expenses from acquisitions and disposals.  

Underlying total expenses, which exclude the restructuring costs and the impact of foreign currency movements, grew 7.1%. Included in this growth is the $33 million period-over-period net increase in total expenses from acquisitions and disposals which accounted for 440 basis points of the growth.  

Organic total expense growth, which excludes restructuring costs, the impact of foreign currency movements, and the net impact of acquisitions and disposals, was 2.7%, down significantly from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by expense management initiatives including the Operational Improvement Program.  

Salaries and Benefits  

Reported salaries and benefits were $600 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 5.4% from $569 million in the prior year quarter. The growth in salaries and benefits included $19 million of favorable foreign currency movements and a $20 million net increase in expenses from acquisitions and disposals.  

Underlying salaries and benefits, which exclude the impact from foreign currency movements, grew 9.1%. Included in this growth is the $20 million period-over-period net increase in salaries and benefits from acquisitions and disposals which accounted for 360 basis points of the growth.  

Organic salaries and benefits, which exclude the impact from foreign currency movements and net expenses from acquisitions and disposals, grew 5.5%, primarily driven by period-over-period headcount growth of approximately 1%, annual salary increases, and increased production incentives driven by improved commissions and fees growth in the International segment during the quarter.  

3  

Other operating expenses  

Reported other operating expenses were $165 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 0.6% from $166 million in the prior year quarter. The decline in other operating expenses included $5 million of favorable foreign currency movements and a $9 million net increase in expenses from acquisitions and disposals.  

Underlying other operating expenses, which exclude the impact from foreign currency movements, increased 2.5%. Included in this growth is the $9 million period-over-period net increase in other operating expenses from acquisitions and disposals which accounted for 560 basis points of growth.  

Organic other operating expenses, which exclude the impact from foreign currency movements and net expenses from acquisitions and disposals, declined 3.1% driven by company-wide cost management initiatives and reflecting the non-recurrence of certain branding-related expenses that were incurred in the prior period.  

Operating margin  

Willis Group reported operating margin was 14.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 130 basis points compared to the fourth quarter 2013 margin.  

Underlying operating margin, which excludes the restructuring costs and the net impact from foreign currency movements, was 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the fourth quarter 2013.  

Organic operating margin, which further excludes the net impact of revenues and expenses from acquisitions and disposals, was 16.6% in the fourth quarter 2014, an increase of 170 basis points from 14.9% in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by improved organic revenue growth and expense management initiatives.  

Taxes  

The reported tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 was approximately 28%. The full year 2014 reported tax rate was approximately 31%. After excluding the impact of certain items as described in note 6, the tax rates for the quarter and full year were approximately 24% and 25%, respectively. The most significant underlying adjustment for the full year was a non-cash adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  

Segment Revenue Results  

Willis North America  

Organic commissions and fees in the Willis North America segment declined 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. Organic growth was negatively impacted by the non-recurrence in the current quarter of a $5 million revenue recognition adjustment that positively impacted revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact from this one-time adjustment, organic commissions and fees would have been down 0.5%.  

4  

The modest decline was largely driven by the Construction and Real Estate/Hospitality practices both being down mid-single digits in the quarter. These practices were impacted by reduced project-driven revenues partly due to timing of such projects moving to past and future quarters.  

Notwithstanding the weakness in those two practices, the North America segment continued to generate solid levels of new business and retention levels were consistent with the prior year. The Human Capital and FINEX practices performed well during the quarter, delivering mid-single digit and high-single digit growth, respectively.  

Willis North America organic commission and fees for the full year 2014 grew 2.8%.  

Willis International  

The Willis International segment achieved 15.9% organic growth in commissions and fees in the fourth quarter 2014 compared with the same period in 2013. Organic growth benefited from the non-recurrence in the quarter of a revenue recognition adjustment in China that negatively impacted revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of this change in revenue recognition, organic growth in International would have been 11.0%.  

Growth in Willis International came from all regions. Despite challenging economic conditions, operations in Western Europe grew double digits, with growth across most markets in the region. Eastern Europe also grew double digits, with significant growth in Russia. Latin America grew high single digits, led by Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. Asia grew double digits, with growth across most countries in the region.  

Willis International organic commission and fees for the full year 2014 grew 9.0%.  

Willis Global  

Organic commissions and fees in the Willis Global segment, which comprises Willis Re, Willis Insurance UK, Facultative, Risk, and Willis Capital Markets & Advisory, declined 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with the fourth quarter of 2013.  

This performance reflects varied results across the segment’s businesses. Willis Re grew mid-single digits in what is seasonally its quietest quarter, with good growth in both the North America and International businesses. Willis Insurance UK was down low single digits. Natural Resources, FAJS/Hughes-Gibb and UK Large Accounts showed solid growth, but this growth was offset by revenue decreases in the Transport, Construction, Real Estate and Insolvency businesses.  

Willis Global organic commission and fees for the full year 2014 grew 1.4%.  

Operational Improvement Program  

Willis generated savings from the operational improvement program of $9 million in the fourth quarter and $11 million for the full year 2014, modestly better than anticipated.  

Restructuring costs from the program were $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Restructuring costs for the full year 2014 were $36 million. Details of the costs by segment and type of expense are included in note 7 of the supplemental financial information attached to the release.  

5  

The Company will provide an update on the progress of the Program and associated spend and savings estimates when it reports its second quarter 2015 results.  

Full Year 2014 Financial Results  

Reported net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was $362 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, compared with $365 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Underlying earnings per diluted share were $2.33 for full year 2014, compared with $2.45 in 2013.  

Total commissions and fees were $3,767 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3,633 million for 2013. Organic growth in commissions and fees was 3.8% over the same period.  

Reported operating income and reported operating margin were $647 million and 17.0%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, compared with $663 million and 18.1%, respectively, for the prior year. Underlying operating margin was 18.0% in 2014, a decrease of 60 basis points from 18.6% in 2013. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and disposals, organic operating margin was 18.2%, a decrease of 20 basis points from 18.4% in 2013.  

Balance Sheet Highlights  

As of December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents were $635 million, total debt was $2,309 million and total equity was $2,007 million. As of December 31, 2013, cash and cash equivalents totaled $796 million, total debt was $2,326 million and total equity was $2,243 million.  

Dividends  

At its February 2015 Board meeting, the Board of Directors approved a 3.3% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.31 per share (an annual rate of $1.24 per share). The dividend is payable on April 15, 2015 to shareholders of record at March 31, 2015. 

Share Buyback  

Willis intends to buy back approximately $175 million in shares in 2015 to offset the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. The buybacks will be made in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. The share buyback program may be modified, extended or terminated at any time by the Board of Directors.  

2015 Outlook  

Dominic Casserley stated, “We enter the new year well positioned. We expect to drive our 2015 performance with mid-single digit organic revenue growth, supported by our recent acquisitions which we expect will deliver underlying EBITDA ranging from $55 million to $65 million, depending on when we close the Miller transaction. Finally, we expect that our organic cost management actions, combined with the impact of our Operational Improvement Program, will allow us to deliver at least 130 basis points of positive spread between organic revenue and expense growth in 2015.”

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

(in millions, except per share data) (unaudited)  

 1. Definitions of non-GAAP financial measures  

We believe that investors’ understanding of the Company’s performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures. Our method of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.  

Organic commissions and fees growth  

Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; and (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, from reported commissions and fees growth.  

We believe organic growth in commissions and fees provides a measure that the investment community may find helpful in assessing the performance of operations that were part of our operations in both the current and prior periods, and provides a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.  

Underlying commissions and fees, underlying revenues, underlying total expenses, underlying salaries and benefits, underlying other operating expenses, underlying operating income, underlying operating margin, underlying EBITDA, underlying net income and underlying net income per diluted share (“Underlying measures”).  

Underlying measures are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items, including foreign currency translation, from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We believe that excluding such items provides a more complete and consistent comparative analysis of our results of operations.  

Organic revenues, organic total expenses, organic salaries and benefits, organic other operating expenses, organic operating income, organic operating margin and organic EBITDA (“Organic measures”).  

Organic measures are calculated by excluding the twelve month impact from acquisitions and disposals (together with the impact of certain items, including foreign currency translation noted above), from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We believe that excluding these items provides a more complete and consistent comparative analysis of our results of operations.
