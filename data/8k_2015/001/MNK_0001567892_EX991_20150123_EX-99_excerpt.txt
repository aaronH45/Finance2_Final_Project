"Funding additional initiatives and seeking attractive business development opportunities remain top priorities as we continue to pursue a range of focused growth strategies," said Mark Trudeau, Chief Executive Officer and President of Mallinckrodt. "This authorization reflects our strong financial position and commitment to a disciplined capital allocation strategy while reaffirming our confidence in the company's outlook and long-term potential.
