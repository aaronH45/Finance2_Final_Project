On January 9, 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (the “Company”) and Walgreen Co. (“Walgreens”) entered into a Retirement and Release Agreement with Gregory D. Wasson (the “Retirement Agreement”). Mr. Wasson’s retirement was previously announced by Walgreens and disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Walgreens with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 10, 2014 (the “Previous Form 8-K”). Pursuant to the Retirement Agreement, Mr. Wasson’s retirement from the Company and Walgreens became effective as of January 9, 2015. The Retirement Agreement provides that Mr. Wasson will receive the retirement payments and benefits to which he is entitled under the compensation and benefit plans of the Company and Walgreens, as well as additional vesting of certain restricted stock units and performance shares, as described in Exhibit A to the Retirement Agreement, and continued personal security benefits for twelve months following his retirement. The Retirement Agreement includes a release of claims against the Company, Walgreens and their affiliates, a two-year non-solicit covenant with respect to employees and customers and a mutual non-disparagement covenant, and specifies that the non-competition covenants in Mr. Wasson’s restricted stock unit award agreements will continue to apply, as modified by the Retirement Agreement to limit competing businesses to a specified list of companies. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Retirement Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  

As previously announced by Walgreens and disclosed in the Previous Form 8-K, Stefano Pessina has been appointed to serve as Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company and James A. Skinner has been appointed to serve as Executive Chairman of the Company, in each case pending the completion of the search for a successor to Mr. Wasson as Chief Executive Officer. Messrs. Pessina and Skinner commenced service in such positions on January 9, 2015.
