VOORHEES, N.J., Feb. 24, 2015 – American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE: AWK), the largest and most geographically diverse publicly traded U.S. water and wastewater utility company, today reported strong results for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2014. 

“The people of American Water continued to execute on our strategy and achieved strong results in 2014,” said Susan Story, president and CEO of American Water. “With customers at the center of what we do, we made much-needed and prioritized infrastructure investments to ensure reliable service and meet water quality standards while leveraging technologies and increasing efficiencies to lessen the impact on what our customers pay.  

“We continued to grow our business, completing 13 regulated acquisitions representing an additional 4,500 customers, and we have 11 announced, pending acquisitions representing about 21,500 additional new customers. In our Market-Based businesses, our Military Services Group won two competitively bid contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, and our homeowner services business expanded into eight new states and received a notice of intent to be awarded an exclusive service line protection agreement with the Orlando Utilities Commission,” Story said. 

Continuing Operations 

For the year, the company reported income from continuing operations of $429.8 million, or $2.39 per diluted common share, compared with income from continuing operations of $370.8 million, or $2.07 per diluted common share, in 2013. Excluding the impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia of $0.04 per diluted share in 2014 and the tender offer of $0.14 per diluted share in 2013, adjusted income from continuing operations (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $436.8 million, or $2.43 per diluted share, an increase of 10 percent over $2.21 per diluted share in 2013. This increase was mainly due to continued revenue growth in both the Regulated and Market-Based businesses and lower operating and interest expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and taxes. 

For the fourth quarter of 2014, the company reported income from continuing operations of $93.9 million, or $0.52 per diluted common share, compared to income from continuing operations of $61.1 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share, in the same quarter of the previous year. Excluding the impact of the tender offer of $0.14 per diluted share in 2013, adjusted income from continuing operations (a non-GAAP financial measure) was up $0.04 per diluted share, an increase of 8.3 percent mainly due to continued revenue growth in both the Regulated and Market-Based businesses, partially offset by higher depreciation expense.

AMERICAN WATER REPORTS 2014 FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS 

The company’s capital investment for 2014 was approximately $1 billion, up from $950 million in 2013. The company anticipates investing $6 billion over the next five years, with $5.2 billion aimed at improving the water and wastewater infrastructure that provides reliability and quality to customers.  

Regulated Operations 

For the quarter, American Water’s Regulated Businesses’ revenues increased by $5.2 million, or 0.8 percent, as compared to the same quarter in 2013. Operating revenues increased by $80.4 million, or 3.1 percent, for the year as compared to 2013. The increase in revenues was primarily due to rate authorizations and infrastructure and other surcharges, as well as revenues from acquisitions. The increases were partially offset by lower demand.  

The Regulated Businesses’ operation and maintenance (O&M) expense decreased $0.3 million, or 0.1 percent, for the fourth quarter of 2014, and increased $6.1 million, or 0.5 percent, for the year, compared to the same periods in 2013. The increased costs for the year were mainly due to increased production costs, the impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia and increased uncollectible expense, largely offset by lower pension and other employee-related costs and operational efficiencies. 

American Water continued its focus on operational efficiencies to help make capital investments more affordable for customers. For the year, the adjusted O&M efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was 36.7 percent, compared to 38.5 percent for 2013.  

“Thanks to our continuous improvement measures and the hard work of our employees, we were able to increase our planned capital investment by an additional $100 million, for a total investment of $1 billion in needed upgrades to water and wastewater infrastructure in 2014, while continuing to deliver water for about a penny per gallon or less,” said Story. “According to research from the Water Research Foundation and the Water Environment Research Foundation, every $1 million of investment equals five direct jobs and 11 indirect jobs, which means in addition to ensuring reliability and water quality for our customers, our total investment of $1 billion helped fuel about 16,000 jobs in the communities we serve.”  

As of Feb 20, the company received approximately $88.4 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, step increases and infrastructure surcharges. This includes the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission settlement agreement in the company’s 2014 Indiana rate filing authorizing $5.1 million in additional revenues effective Jan. 29, 2015. 

As of Feb. 20, the company was awaiting final orders and/or proposed settlements for general rate cases in four states, requesting approximately $91.1 million in total additional revenues and $2.4 million in infrastructure charges. The extent to which requested rate increases will be granted by the applicable regulatory agencies will vary. All revenue amounts are based on current usage. 

The company continued to expand its customer base, completing 13 acquisitions within its service areas in seven states, adding approximately 4,500 customers. On Nov. 4, voters in three communities – Haddonfield, N.J., Arnold, Mo., and Russiaville, Ind. – approved referendums for American Water to purchase their water and/or wastewater assets. Following regulatory approval and financial close, these and several other pending acquisitions will add about 21,500 customers to the company’s regulated footprint. 

Market-Based Operations 

For the quarter, Market-Based revenues increased by $20.0 million, or 24.8 percent, and increased $52.1 million, or 17.2 percent, for the year. The increase was mainly due to additional revenues from growth in the homeowner services business and construction activities in the company’s Military Services Group. This increase was partially offset by portfolio optimization efforts, which decreased revenue from discontinued municipal and industrial contracts, as well as additional price redeterminations for some military contracts in 2013. 

The Market-Based Businesses’ O&M expense increased $17.0 million, or 25.0 percent, for the quarter and $48.8 million, or 20.3 percent, for the year. Higher costs were mainly due to an increase in operating supplies and services for construction projects for military contracts and additional repair costs in the homeowner services business due to an increased number of contracts. Also included in the 2013 fourth quarter and year-end results was the release of $3.8 million in loss contract reserves. 

American Water’s Market-Based Businesses continued to grow. The company’s homeowner services business, American Water Resources, expanded its service line offerings into eight new states in 2014, continued to grow its New York City partnership, and also launched its exclusive program with Metro Water Services in Nashville. During the fourth quarter, American Water Resources received notice of intent by the Orlando Utilities Commission to be awarded an exclusive home warranty protection agreement for more than 230,000 customers. The program is expected to launch in the first half of 2015.

2015 Earnings Guidance 

American Water affirmed its 2015 earnings guidance from continuing operations (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share. The company’s earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below and under “Risk Factors” in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. 

Anti-Dilution Share Repurchase Program 

In February 2015, American Water’s Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program (the “Program”) for the specific purpose of providing a vehicle to minimize share dilution that occurs through its dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and executive compensation programs. The Program will allow the company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time to manage dilution. Under the Program, American Water may repurchase its common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Program will be conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and, in order to facilitate the repurchase of the company’s Common Stock under the Program, the company has also entered into a Rule 10b5-1 share repurchase plan with a broker. By having the Program administered through a Rule 10b5-1 plan, the company will be able to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Subject to applicable regulations, the company may elect to amend or cancel the Program or the Rule 10b5-1 parameters at its discretion. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release includes a presentation of adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations. These items are derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but are not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS from continuing operations are defined, respectively, as GAAP income from continuing operations and GAAP diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations excluding the one-time impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia and the company’s tender offer in 2013. These items constitute “non-GAAP financial measures” under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement the company’s GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure. 

Management believes that this adjustment provides the company and its investors with an indication of American Water’s baseline performance excluding items that are not considered to be reflective of ongoing results. Management does not intend results excluding the adjustment to represent results as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider it as an alternative measurement calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of the company’s performance. Accordingly, the measurements have limitations depending on their use. 

This press release also includes a presentation of adjusted O&M efficiency ratio, which excludes from its calculation estimated purchased water revenues and purchased water expenses, the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, and the impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill as well as the estimated impact of weather in the third quarter of 2014. This item is derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The item constitutes a “non-GAAP financial measure” under SEC rules. This non-GAAP financial measure supplements the company’s GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure.

AMERICAN WATER REPORTS 2014 FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS 

Management believes that the presentation of this measure is useful to investors because it provides a means of evaluating the company’s operating performance without giving effect to estimated purchased water revenues and purchased water expenses as well as the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, and the impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill and weather during the quarter, which involve items that are not reflective of management’s ability to increase efficiency of the company’s regulated operations. In preparing operating plans, budgets and forecasts, and in assessing historical performance, management relies, in part, on trends in the company’s historical results, exclusive of estimated revenues and expenses related to purchased water and the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs. 

Set forth below are tables that reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
