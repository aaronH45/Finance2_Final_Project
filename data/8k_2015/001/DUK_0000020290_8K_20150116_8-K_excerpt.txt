On January 16, 2015, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) issued a letter requesting additional information in connection with the application filed on September 11, 2014, by Duke Energy Commercial Asset Management, LLC (“DECAM”), a subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (the “Company”), Duke Energy Retail Sales, LLC, a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation, and Dynegy Resource I, LLC (“Dynegy” and together with DECAM and Duke Energy Retail Sales, LLC, the “Parties”), to approve the sale of the Company’s Midwest commercial generation business to Dynegy. The letter seeks further economic analysis, including (1) a delivered price test, to assess the combined market power impacts of the proposed transaction and Dynegy’s simultaneous acquisition of the Energy Capital Partners assets in the PJM interconnection, L.L.C. market, and (2) certain information relating to how Dynegy customers will be protected from any adverse effect on rates that might result from its purchase of the Company’s Midwest commercial generation business. The Parties intend to fully respond to the request for additional information within 30 days. As a result of this additional request of FERC, the Parties do not expect the transaction to close by the end of the first quarter of 2015 but remain committed to closing the transaction as quickly as possible after receipt of FERC approval, which is the final regulatory approval required to close.
