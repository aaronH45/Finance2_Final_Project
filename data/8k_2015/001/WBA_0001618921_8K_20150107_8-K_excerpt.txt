Commercial Paper Program  

On January 8, 2015, the Company entered into a new commercial paper program (the “Program”) on a private placement basis, pursuant to which the Company may issue up to $3.0 billion of short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) outstanding at any time.  

Under the Program, the Company may issue the Notes from time to time and use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Program is backed by the Company’s $3.0 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility and will initially be guaranteed (the “Guarantee”) by Walgreens. The Notes will be sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and the Notes and Guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and Walgreens, respectively. The Notes will be sold at a negotiated discount from par or will bear interest at a negotiated rate on a fixed or floating basis. The maturities of the Notes will vary but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue.

The definitive documents regarding the Program contain customary representations, warranties, covenants, defaults and indemnification provisions, and provide the terms under which the Notes will be sold pursuant to an exemption from the federal and state securities laws.  

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws. The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.
