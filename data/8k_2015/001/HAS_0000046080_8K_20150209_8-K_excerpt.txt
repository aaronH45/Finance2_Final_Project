Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 

On February 9, 2015, Hasbro, Inc. ("Hasbro" or "we") announced our financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 28, 2014, and certain other financial information. The press release, attached as Exhibit 99.1, includes a financial measure, Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that EBITDA is one of the appropriate measures for evaluating our operating performance, because it reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet and make strategic acquisitions. However, this measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP as more fully discussed in our financial statements and filings with the SEC. The EBITDA measures included in the press release have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as is required under SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures.  

The press release also includes the Company's costs and expenses, operating profit, net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of charges related to restructuring of the Company's investment in a television network joint venture in 2014, charges related to restructuring activities in both 2014 and 2013, restructuring related pension charges in 2013, product-related charges in 2013 associated with brands which the Company exited or for which the Company has reduced its future expectations, charges related to the settlement of an adverse arbitration award in 2013, a gain on sale of intellectual property license rights in 2014 and certain favorable tax adjustments in both 2014 and 2013 related to the settlement of tax examinations. Management believes that presenting this data excluding these charges and tax benefits assists investors' understanding of the performance of the Company's underlying business. 

As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The information furnished in Item 2.02, including the Exhibit attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for any purpose, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
