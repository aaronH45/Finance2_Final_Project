CROWN CASTLE REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 

FULL YEAR 2014 RESULTS; RAISES FULL YEAR 2015 OUTLOOK

2014 HIGHLIGHTS

•Delivered Organic Site Rental Revenue growth of $156 million in 2014

•Increased our annual dividend on our common stock to $3.28 per share

•Significantly increased our small cell networks to over 7,000 miles of fiber supporting 14,000 nodes on-air or under construction

•Successfully completed the integration of approximately 9,700 towers from the AT&T tower transaction

January 21, 2015 - HOUSTON, TEXAS - Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) ("Crown Castle") today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. 

"We delivered another quarter of great results during the fourth quarter, wrapping up a very strong year in 2014," stated Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We continue to demonstrate our ability to grow our business, generating Organic Site Rental Revenue growth of $156 million in 2014. In addition to the excellent financial results achieved during the year, 2014 was a pivotal year on many fronts. In 2014, we commenced operations as a REIT, meaningfully increased our common stock dividend, substantially grew our small cell networks, and integrated the AT&T tower portfolio. I believe these accomplishments position our portfolio of US-focused, mission-critical wireless infrastructure to deliver significant shareholder value through long-term growth in our dividend and AFFO. Looking at 2015, as evidenced by our increased full year Outlook, we expect all four major US wireless carriers to continue to make investments to upgrade and enhance their networks to meet growing consumer demand."

FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES 

During the fourth quarter of 2014, Crown Castle invested approximately $267 million in capital expenditures, comprised of $35 million of land purchases, $40 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $192 million of revenue generating capital expenditures.

During fourth quarter 2014, Crown Castle also invested approximately $286 million in acquisitions, primarily related to acquisitions of ground interests underneath towers. 

On December 31, 2014, Crown Castle paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.82 per common share, or approximately $274 million in aggregate. Diluted common shares outstanding at December 31, 2014 were 333.6 million.

As of December 31, 2014, Crown Castle's outstanding debt had a weighted average coupon of 4.1% per annum and a weighted average maturity of six years. Further, Crown Castle's net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to fourth quarter annualized Adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 5.4x.

As of December 31, 2014, Crown Castle had approximately $176 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash). Subsequent to fourth quarter 2014, Crown Castle Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Crown Castle, increased the size of its $1.5 billion Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility ("Revolver") by $630 million to a total capacity of $2.13 billion. All other existing terms of the Revolver remain unchanged. After giving effect to the increase in the Revolver, Crown Castle has approximately $1.4 billion of availability under its Revolver.

"Our strong finish to 2014 allows us to increase our full year 2015 Outlook for site rental revenues, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share," stated Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. "As we enter 2015, I am excited about our ability to deliver attractive long-term total shareholder returns given our significant common stock dividend, the growth from the contracted escalation in our tenant leases, and the growth opportunities that lie ahead of us as US wireless carriers continue to invest to meet consumer demand. We believe our strategy of investing in the US, which is the largest wireless market in the world, will drive growth in AFFO and dividend per share over the long-term."

OUTLOOK

This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The following Outlook is based on current expectations and assumptions and assumes a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.81 US dollars to 1.0 Australian dollar ("Exchange Rate") for first quarter 2015 and full year 2015.

As reflected in the table below, Crown Castle has increased the midpoint of its full year 2015 Outlook for site rental revenues, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by approximately $11 million, $13 million, $14 million and $8 million, respectively. The increased midpoint of full year 2015 Outlook for site rental revenues, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO reflects the results and aforementioned completed acquisitions from fourth quarter 2014 and includes the negative impact of approximately $9 million, $7 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively, from a decrease in the Exchange Rate compared to the previously provided Outlook. The completed acquisitions during fourth quarter 2014 did not materially contribute to full year 2014 results and are expected 

The Foundation for a Wireless World.

News Release continued: Page 4

to contribute $5 million to full year 2015 AFFO. The increase in full year 2015 Outlook assumes an increase of approximately $5 million in Organic Site Rental Revenue growth as compared to the previously provided Outlook.

Crown Castle expects 2015 new leasing activity to be similar to 2014, offset by an increased level of tenant non-renewals. The midpoint of 2015 Outlook reflects Organic Site Rental Revenue growth of approximately 4% compared to 2014, or approximately $125 million. The Organic Site Rental Revenue growth of approximately $125 million in 2015 is comprised of approximately $150 million from new leasing activity and $90 million from escalations on existing tenant lease contracts, less approximately $115 million from non-renewals. Of the approximately $150 million in new leasing activity, expected contributions from tower leasing and small cells leasing are $100 million and $50 million, respectively.

The midpoint of 2015 Outlook for site rental revenue growth is expected to be approximately $60 million, after adjusting Organic Site Rental Revenue growth of approximately $125 million by $65 million for straight-line accounting and exchange rates and other items. The adjustment for straight-line accounting removes the benefit of approximately $90 million in contractual escalators on existing tenant leases and adds approximately $30 million in straight-line revenues related to new leasing activity, including tenant lease renewals. See chart below for reconciliation of 2015 Outlook for Organic Site Rental Revenue and site rental revenues. 

As previously disclosed, based on Sprint's stated intention to decommission its iDEN network and Crown Castle's contractual terms with Sprint, Crown Castle expects site rental revenues to be negatively impacted by approximately $60 million to $70 million in 2015. Additionally, during 2015, Crown Castle expects site rental revenues to be impacted by non-renewals of $35 million to $45 million as a result of the decommissioning of the LEAP, MetroPCS and Clearwire networks. 

The Foundation for a Wireless World.

CrownCastle.com

News Release continued: Page 5

Over the last two years, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint acquired LEAP, MetroPCS, and Clearwire ("Acquired Networks"), respectively. Crown Castle currently expects potential non-renewals from the decommissioning of the Acquired Networks in aggregate to be approximately $200 million in current run-rate site rental revenues, the majority of which Crown Castle expects to occur between 2015 and 2018 at a rate of approximately 1% to 2% of consolidated site rental revenues in any given year. Depending on the eventual network deployment and decommissioning plans for the Acquired Networks, the impact and timing of such non-renewals may vary from Crown Castle's expectations. Additional information regarding non-renewals from carrier consolidation is available in Crown Castle's quarterly Supplemental Information Package posted in the Investors section of its website. 

The midpoint of full year 2015 Outlook for Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO assumes network services gross margin contribution remains consistent with the levels achieved in 2014; however, on a sequential basis, the midpoint of first quarter 2015 Outlook for Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO assumes a decrease of $5 million in network services gross margin contribution from fourth quarter 2014. 

Compared to fourth quarter 2014, the midpoint of first quarter 2015 Outlook for AFFO benefits from lower sustaining capital expenditures. The expected sequential decrease in sustaining capital expenditures in first quarter 2015 is attributable to seasonality and timing, as a portion of sustaining capital expenditures previously expected in the 2015 Outlook occurred in fourth quarter 2014.

The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current Outlook for first quarter 2015 and full year 2015:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Calculations

This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations, Organic Site Rental Revenues, and Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")). Each of the amounts included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO, Organic Site Rental Revenues, and Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of: (1) sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP and (2) our adjustment to the income tax provision in calculations of AFFO for periods prior to our REIT conversion. 

Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO, Organic Site Rental Revenues and Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector or those reported by other REITs. Our FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to those reported in accordance with National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, including with respect to the impact of income taxes for periods prior to our REIT conversion.

Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO, Organic Site Rental Revenues and Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. 

During the first quarter of 2014, Crown Castle updated its definitions of FFO and AFFO. The updated definitions of FFO and AFFO are intended to reflect the recurring nature of Crown Castle's site rental business and assist in comparing Crown Castle’s performance with the performance of its public tower company peers. Under the updated calculation of AFFO, Crown Castle reflects the benefit of prepaid rent from customers over the weighted-average life of customer contracts rather than in the period in which the prepaid rent was received. The updates to the definition of FFO were primarily made to present the periods shown in a manner which is consistent with our commencement of operations as a REIT on January 1, 2014. These measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, FFO and AFFO as set forth in this release and the supplemental information package are presented based on the updated definitions. Crown Castle has provided reconciliations of the updated definitions of FFO and AFFO to the prior definitions below. 

Adjusted EBITDA. Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation expense.

Funds from Operations ("FFO"). Crown Castle defines Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends, and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders. 

FFO per share. Crown Castle defines FFO per share as FFO divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 

FFO, as previously defined. Crown Castle defines FFO, as previously defined, as FFO plus non-cash portion of tax provision, less asset write-down charges and noncontrolling interest. 

Adjusted Funds from Operations ("AFFO"). Crown Castle defines Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-line revenue, straight-line expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and less capital improvement capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures.

AFFO per share. Crown Castle defines AFFO per share as AFFO divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 

AFFO, as previously defined. Crown Castle defines AFFO, as previously defined, as AFFO plus prepaid rent received less amortization of prepaid rent.

Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted. Crown Castle defines Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, as site rental revenues, as reported, less straight-line revenues. 

Organic Site Rental Revenues. Crown Castle defines Organic Site Rental Revenues as site rental revenues, as reported, less straight-line revenues, the impact of tower acquisitions and construction, foreign currency adjustments and certain non recurring items.

Sustaining capital expenditures. Crown Castle defines sustaining capital expenditures as either (1) corporate related capital improvements, such as buildings, information technology equipment and office equipment or (2) capital improvements to tower sites that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the tower.

The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management's current expectations. Such statements include, but are not limited to, plans, projections, Outlook and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, returns and shareholder value which may be derived from our business and assets, our investments and our acquisitions, (2) demand for our sites and services, (3) our growth, (4) leasing activity, including new tenant installations and amendments and the impact of such leasing activity on our results and Outlook, (5) carrier network investments and upgrades, and potential benefits derived therefrom, (6) our dividends, including our dividend plans, the amount and growth of our dividends, and the potential benefits therefrom, (7) small cells, including growth and margin contribution, (8) our strategy, (9) currency exchange rates, (10) non-renewal of leases and the timing and impact thereof, including with respect to the Acquired Networks, (11) the iDEN network decommissioning, including the impact and timing thereof, (12) capital expenditures, including sustaining capital expenditures, (13) timing items, (14) operating and general and administrative expenses, (15) site rental revenues and Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, (16) site rental cost of operations, (17) site rental gross margin and network services gross margin, (18) Adjusted EBITDA, (19) interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (20) FFO, including on a per share basis, (21) AFFO, including on a per share basis, (22) Organic Site Rental Revenues and Organic Site Rental Revenue growth, (23) net income (loss), including on a per share basis, (24) our common shares outstanding, including on a diluted basis, (25) the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures, and (26) the utility of our updated definitions of FFO and AFFO. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including but not limited to prevailing market conditions and the following:

•Our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and wireless infrastructure, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for new tenant additions and network services).

•A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services.

•Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments and 4.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated. 

•We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.

•Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

•As a result of competition in our industry, including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have, we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing customer contracts.

•The business model for our small cell operations contains differences from our traditional site rental business, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate that business model or identify or manage those operational risks, such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated.

•New technologies may significantly reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and negatively impact our revenues.

•New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected.

•If we fail to retain rights to our wireless infrastructure, including the land under our sites, our business may be adversely affected.

•Our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.

•The expansion and development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings, or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.

•If we fail to comply with laws and regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.

•If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.

•Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.

The Foundation for a Wireless World.

•We may be adversely affected by our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our operations in Australia.

•Future dividend payments to our common stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.

•Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the US Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.

•Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.

•If we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the 4.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in cash, common stock or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our Common Stock, which may jeopardize our status as a REIT.

•We have limited experience operating as a REIT. Our failure to successfully operate as a REIT may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flow, the per share trading price of our common stock, or our ability to satisfy debt service obligations.

•REIT ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock. 

Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC.
