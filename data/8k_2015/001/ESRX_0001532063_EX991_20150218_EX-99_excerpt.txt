Express Scripts Announces 4th Quarter Results; Provides Initial 2015 Earnings Guidance  

ST. LOUIS, February 23, 2015 — Express Scripts Holding Company (Nasdaq: ESRX) announced 2014 fourth quarter and full year net income attributable to Express Scripts stockholders of $581.8 million and $2,007.6 million, or $0.79 and $2.64 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, as detailed in Table 4, were $1.39 and $4.88 for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively.1  

“While we are proud of our heritage and the work we have done for clients, we are even more excited about the future we have ahead of us,” stated George Paz, chairman and chief executive officer. “We believe our growth and focused acquisition approach has positioned us uniquely in the healthcare services landscape to improve health outcomes and lower cost in an aligned model that keeps our clients and patients first, but also returns exceptional results to our shareholders.”  

“We believe no one drives market change like we do, and no one matches our focus on serving patients and plan sponsors,” stated Tim Wentworth, president. “That combination is unique and creates significant value for our clients.”

Table 3  

Express Scripts Holding Company EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation  

(in millions, except per claim data)  

The following is a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations attributable to Express Scripts to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations attributable to Express Scripts. The Company believes net income is the most directly comparable measure calculated under U.S. GAAP.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: See Appendix for Footnotes   

The Company is providing EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA excluding the impact of certain charges (both of which are non-GAAP financial measures) in order to compare the underlying financial performance to prior periods.  

EBITDA from continuing operations is earnings before interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and equity income from joint venture, or alternatively calculated as operating income plus depreciation and amortization. EBITDA from continuing operations is presented because it is a widely accepted indicator of a company’s ability to service indebtedness and is frequently used to evaluate a company’s performance. EBITDA from continuing operations, however, should not be considered as an alternative to net income from continuing operations, as a measure of operating performance, as an alternative to cash flow, as a measure of liquidity or as a substitute for any other measure computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, our definition and calculation of EBITDA from continuing operations may not be comparable to that used by other companies.  

Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations per adjusted claim is a supplemental measurement used by analysts and investors to help evaluate overall operating performance. We have calculated adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations excluding transaction and integration costs recorded each year, as these charges are not considered an indicator of ongoing company performance. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations per adjusted claim is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations by the adjusted claim volume for the period. This measure is used as an indicator of EBITDA performance on a per-unit basis. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, and as a result, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations per adjusted claim, are each affected by the changes in claim volumes between retail and home delivery, the relative representation of brand-name, generic and specialty pharmacy drugs, as well as the level of efficiency in the business.  

 * Depreciation and amortization for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014 presented above includes $46.0 million and $92.1 million, respectively, of depreciation related to the integration of Medco Health Solutions, Inc. (“Medco”) which is not included in transaction and integration costs. Depreciation and amortization for the three months and year ended December 31, 2013 presented above includes $20.5 million and $31.6 million, respectively, of depreciation related to the integration of Medco, which is not included in transaction and integration costs.

GAAP items not included in guidance (*) 

The Company anticipates full-year 2015 integration costs to be approximately $250 million, but the exact amount is indeterminable. Accordingly, the Company is unable to include these charges in the list of GAAP items not included in guidance for 2015 full-year earnings per diluted share attributable to Express Scripts, adjusted selling, general and administrative, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per adjusted claim or to provide a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure. 2015 Adjusted EPS will exclude amortization of intangible assets per diluted share in the range of $1.51 to $1.55.  

 ** Approximately $305 to $325 million of this depreciation guidance is included in the guidance for adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses. The remainder of the depreciation guidance is reported in cost of goods sold.
