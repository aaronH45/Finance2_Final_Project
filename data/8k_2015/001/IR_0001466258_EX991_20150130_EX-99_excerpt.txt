“We continued to create value in 2014 through growth, operational excellence and balanced capital allocation,” said Michael W. Lamach, chairman and chief executive officer. “Revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share exceeded guidance despite uneven markets, and international currency declines late in the year. Throughout the year, we made investments into the businesses consistent with driving organic growth and earnings improvements, maintained a strong balance sheet and initiated disciplined acquisitions that fit within our core businesses. We have a multi-year record of executing on our strategy and I am confident we can continue to deliver value in 2015.”

Additional Highlights from the 2014 Fourth Quarter

Revenues: The company’s reported revenues increased 5 percent (up 7 percent excluding the impact of currency) to $3,241 million, compared with revenues of $3,099 million for the 2013 fourth quarter. Total U.S. revenues were up 7 percent compared to 2013, and revenues from international operations increased 2 percent (up 7 percent excluding the impact of currency).

Operating Margin: The fourth-quarter operating margin was 10.7 percent compared with 7.0 percent in 2013. Adjusted for restructuring charges, the operating margin for fourth-quarter 2014 was 10.8 percent, up 2.3 percentage points on a comparable basis with 2013. Increased volume, price and productivity savings were partially offset by inflation, an increase in investment spending and negative currency.

Other income totaled $10 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with other expense of $(1) million for the 2013 fourth quarter primarily due to higher earnings from equity investments and foreign exchange gains.

Taxes: Excluding restructuring, and one-time items, the company had an effective tax rate of approximately 25 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014. The comparable effective rate for the fourth quarter of 2013 was 11 percent.

Fourth-Quarter Business Review

[Note: Adjusted margins for 2013 and 2014 exclude restructuring and other onetime costs - see attached tables for additional details]

The Climate Segment delivers energy-efficient solutions globally and includes Trane® and American Standard® Heating and Air Conditioning which provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and commercial and residential building services, parts, support and controls; and Thermo King®, the leader in transport temperature control solutions. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 were

$2,446 million, an increase of 5 percent (up 7 percent excluding currency) compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. Bookings increased 6 percent (up 8 percent excluding currency) year-over-year.

On a year-over-year basis, total commercial HVAC revenues increased by a mid-single digit percentage with a low-single digit percentage increase in equipment revenues and a high-single digit increase in revenues for parts, service and solutions. Commercial HVAC revenues increased by a mid-single digit percentage in the Americas; up by a mid-teens percentage in Europe and declined in Asia during the quarter compared with last year. Currency had a negative 2 percentage point impact on fourth-quarter commercial HVAC results. Fourth-quarter 2014 HVAC bookings reflect a mid-single digit increase compared with last year.

Total Thermo King refrigerated transport revenues increased by a mid-single digit percentage in the fourth quarter compared with last year, as strong revenue gains in North America offset weakness in overseas operations. Bookings increased by a high single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter of 2014, mainly due to sharp gains in North American trailer orders. Currency had a negative 3 percentage point impact on Thermo King fourth-quarter year-over-year revenue comparisons.

Residential HVAC bookings increased by a low-single digit percentage in the fourth quarter compared with 2013 and revenues increased by a high-single digit percentage with volume gains in all major product categories.

Fourth-quarter 2014 segment operating margin was 12.2 percent (excluding restructuring costs, adjusted operating margin was also 12.2 percent). The adjusted margin improved 2.1 percentage points on a comparable basis with 2013 due to higher volumes and productivity gains, partially offset by inflation and negative currency impacts.

The Industrial Segment delivers products and services that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. It includes Ingersoll Rand® compressed air systems and services, power tools, material handling systems, and ARO® fluid management equipment, as well as Club Car® golf, utility and rough terrain vehicles. Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $795 million and increased 3 percent (up 6 percent excluding currency) compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. Bookings increased 3 percent compared with 2013 (up 6 percent excluding currency).

Revenues for air compressors and industrial products were up low-single digits overall, with mid-single digit year-over-year improvements in the Americas, and low-single digit percentage declines in both Europe and in Asia. Currency had a negative 3 percentage point impact on fourth-quarter results.

Club Car revenues increased by a mid-single digit percentage compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, with gains in both golf car and utility vehicle sales.

Fourth-quarter segment operating margin was 15.7 percent (excluding restructuring costs, adjusted operating margin was 15.8 percent). The adjusted operating margin was down slightly on a comparable basis with 2013, as the benefits from volume and improved productivity were offset by inflation, negative currency impacts and investments.

Balance Sheet 

At the end of the fourth quarter, working capital was 3.1 percent of revenues, compared with 2.1 percent in 2013. Cash balances and total debt balances were $1.7 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.

Share Repurchase 

During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares for approximately $200 million as part of a $1.5 billion program approved by the board of directors in February 2014. The company repurchased approximately 22 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion during full-year 2014.

Acquisition of Cameron’s Centrifugal Compressor Business

On January 1, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of the assets of Cameron International Corporation’s (NYSE:CAM) Centrifugal Compression division for $850 million.

The division provides centrifugal compression equipment and aftermarket parts and services for global industrial, air separation, gas transmission and process gas applications. Ingersoll Rand will welcome the Turbo-Air® and MSG® brands into the Ingersoll Rand family of brands.

“Acquiring Cameron’s Centrifugal Compression division and its exceptional line of products has provided Ingersoll Rand the opportunity to expand our industrial segment, allowing us to better serve our industry, shareholders and employees,” said Lamach. “We’re pleased to expand Ingersoll Rand’s compressed air and gas offerings into areas such as air separation, petrochemical, chemical and process gas.” The asset acquisition strengthens Ingersoll Rand’s Compressed Air Systems and Services business, which now provides a comprehensive range of centrifugal, reciprocating and rotary air compressor products, systems and services for a wide variety of industrial, manufacturing, air separation, and process gas applications.
