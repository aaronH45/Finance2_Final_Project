On January 30, 2015, Duke Energy Florida, Inc. (“DEF”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation, filed a request with the Florida Public Service Commission (“FPSC”) for approval of an agreement entered into by DEF to purchase the 599 MW Osprey Energy Center, a combined cycle plant located in Auburndale, Florida, from Osprey Energy Center, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Calpine Corporation (“Calpine”). Under the terms of the agreement, DEF will purchase the Osprey Energy Center for approximately $166 million. DEF has also requested the FPSC to approve, in the alternative, the 320 MW Suwannee combustion turbine peaking generation project if the Osprey transaction is not timely approved. 

Closing is subject to the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FPSC and the expiration of the Hart Scott Rodino waiting period. The targeted closing date for the acquisition of the Osprey unit is January 2017, after the termination of DEF’s Power Purchase Agreement with Calpine.
