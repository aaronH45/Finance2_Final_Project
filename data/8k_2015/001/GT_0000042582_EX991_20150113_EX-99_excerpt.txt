Preliminary View of 2014 Results 

7 

• 

Record total company and North America segment operating income 

• 

Now expect 2014 FY SOI growth slightly below original 10-15% range,  

primarily due to a more challenging industry environment in Europe in Q4  

and stronger dollar globally 

– 

Expect global volume to be essentially flat 

– 

Expect Q4 impact of these developments to be $0.15-$0.20 per share  

below our expectations at time of Q3 call 

• 

Expect free cash flow to be slightly better than anticipated at time of Q3  

call; capital allocation plan remains on track 

Record earnings and strong free cash flow
