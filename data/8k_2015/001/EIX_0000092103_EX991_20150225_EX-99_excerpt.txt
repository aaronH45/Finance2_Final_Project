February 25, 2015 32 Fixed Charge vs. Minimum Bill AB 327 permits the CPUC to authorize up to a $10/month fixed charge, and the Commission may consider whether minimum bills are appropriate as a substitute for any fixed charges • SCE has proposed a $10/month fixed charge while some parties have proposed a “minimum bill” of $10 instead of a fixed charge • Vast majority of SCE’s customers would avoid the minimum bill, given their usage, at the levels proposed by other parties SCE proposes a fixed charge because it begins to mitigate intra-class subsidies from high-usage to low-usage customers and would reduce bill volatility Fixed Charge Minimum Bill • Collected from all customers every month regardless of usage • Triggered only if the customer’s usage falls below a threshold number of kWh $10/month fixed charge recovers 8% of authorized revenue $10 minimum bill recovers 1% of authorized revenue

February 25, 2015 41 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Management uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (or losses) are defined as earnings or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as: exit activities, including sale of certain assets, and other activities that are no longer continuing; asset impairments and certain tax, regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
