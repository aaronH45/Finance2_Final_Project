Election of Officers. On February 19, 2015, Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. (the “Company”) announced that Joseph G. NeCastro had been elected by the Board of Directors as the Company’s Chief Development Officer, reporting to the Chief Executive Officer. In his new position, Mr. NeCastro will oversee and manage the Company’s International and Business Development business units. Mr. NeCastro previously served as the Company’s Chief Financial and Administrative Officer.  

On February 19, 2015, the Company also announced that Lori A. Hickok had been elected by the Board of Directors as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Ms. Hickok had served as the Company’s Executive Vice President, Finance since February 2010; was the Company’s Senior Vice President, Finance from 2008 to 2010 and was Vice President and Controller of The E. W. Scripps Company from 2002 to 2008.  

Amendment to Mr. NeCastro’s Employment Agreement. Effective February 19, 2015, the Company and Mr. NeCastro entered into Amendment No. 3 dated February 19, 2015 to Mr. NeCastro’s Employment Agreement to reflect his new position with the Company. The amendment increases Mr. NeCastro’s base salary to $904,000. The amendment also modifies the multiple of Mr. NeCastro’s annual salary and annual incentive he is entitled to receive upon termination of his employment in certain events, with 2.5 times his annual salary and annual incentive payable in the event his employment terminates by reason of his death or disability, but with a reducing multiple (starting at 2.5 times and reduced proportionately based on the time elapsed to the date of termination over the period from January 1, 2015 through the December 31, 2016 termination date of his employment agreement) in the event his employment is terminated without cause or he terminates his employment for good reason.  

Employment Agreement with Ms. Hickok. The Company and Ms. Hickok also have agreed to the terms of an Employment Agreement to be effective as of February 19, 2015. The term of Ms. Hickok’s employment agreement will continue until December 31, 2017. Under the employment agreement, Ms. Hickok will receive an annual base salary of not less than $675,000, with a target annual incentive opportunity of 65% of her base salary. The Company also agreed to grant Ms. Hickok a time-based restricted share unit award covering a number of shares with a value of $1 million, which generally will vest in equal parts on December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, provided that Ms. Hickok remains in the continuous employment of the Company or a subsidiary. Ms. Hickok will receive certain other benefits under her employment agreement, including a lump sum pension enhancement payable if her employment terminates before she has attained both age 55 and at least 10 years of service that is intended to provide her with the retirement benefits she would have received if she had attained both age 55 and at least 10 years of service before the termination. Ms. Hickok also will be entitled to severance benefits under her employment agreement in the event of an involuntary termination of her employment without cause, a termination of employment by her for good reason or her death or disability in an amount generally equal to at least 1.5 times her base pay and annual incentive. In consideration for these benefits, Ms. Hickok has agreed not to: (i) disclose the Company’s confidential information; (ii) compete against the Company for 12 months after termination, (iii) solicit the Company’s employees, customers and certain others with whom the Company has a business relationship for one year after termination; or (iv) disparage the Company for one year after termination.
