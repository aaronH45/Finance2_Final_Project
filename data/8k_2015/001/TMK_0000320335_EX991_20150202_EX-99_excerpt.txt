FINANCIAL SUMMARY  

Net operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, has long been consistently used by Torchmark’s management to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized investment gains and losses and certain nonrecurring items which are included in net income. Management believes that an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company’s business.

For GAAP reporting, Medicare Part D premiums are recognized evenly throughout the year when they become due, and benefit costs are recognized when the costs are incurred. Due to the design of the product, premiums are evenly distributed throughout the year, but benefit costs are higher earlier in the year. As a result, under GAAP, benefit costs can exceed premiums in the first part of the year but be less than premiums during the remainder of the year. For net operating income purposes, Torchmark defers excess benefits incurred in earlier interim periods to later periods in order to more closely match the benefit cost with the associated revenue. For the full year, the total premiums and benefits are the same under this alternative method as they are under GAAP. The Company reports this difference between GAAP and management’s non-GAAP disclosures, net of tax, as a reconciling item for the interim periods in the Financial Summary included in this release. A chart reconciling the Company’s non-GAAP financial presentation to a GAAP presentation may be viewed on the Company’s website at www.torchmarkcorp.com on the Investor Relations page at Financial Reports.  

Administrative Expenses were $45 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter.

EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2015:  

Torchmark projects that for the year ending December 31, 2015, net operating income per share will be in a range of $4.20 to $4.40. The five cent reduction of the midpoint from the previous guidance is due primarily to an increase in pension expense and to a lesser extent, a reduction in expected Part D margin and a reduction in the expected earnings from our Canadian operations due to the recent change in the Canadian exchange rate.
