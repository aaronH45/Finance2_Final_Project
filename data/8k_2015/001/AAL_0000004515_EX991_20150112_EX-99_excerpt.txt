Exhibit 99.1  

Investor Relations Update  

January 12, 2015  

On December 9, 2013, the Plan of Reorganization of AMR Corporation became effective and the related merger transaction was completed. As a result, US Airways Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the reorganized AMR Corporation (renamed American Airlines Group Inc., or AAG). AAG is providing guidance on a combined basis for 2014. In addition, this guidance reflects certain reclassifications to conform to the new American Airlines Group Inc. financial statement presentation and excludes special items.  

General Overview  

   •   Pre-tax Margin - The Company expects its fourth quarter pre-tax margin (excluding special items) to be approximately 10.0 percent to 11.0 percent.  

   •   Capacity - 2014 total system capacity was up 2.2 percent vs. 2013 primarily due to more active aircraft and larger gauge aircraft replacing smaller gauge legacy aircraft. Full year mainline capacity was up 2.4 percent year-over-year, of which international capacity was up 4.4 percent and domestic capacity was up 1.3 percent vs. 2013.  

   •   Cash - As of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $8.1 billion in total cash and short-term investments, of which $774 million was restricted. The Company also had an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1.8 billion. Approximately $656 million of the Company’s unrestricted cash balance was held in Venezuelan bolivars. This cash balance includes approximately $621 million valued at 6.3 bolivars and approximately $35 million valued at 12.0 bolivars, with the rate depending on the date the Company submitted its repatriation request to the Venezuelan government. The Company’s cash balance held in Venezuelan bolivars decreased $65 million from the September 30, 2014 balance of $721 million. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company incurred an $11 million foreign currency loss related to the receipt of $23 million at a rate of 6.3 bolivars to the dollar for one of its 2012 repatriation requests originally valued at a rate of 4.3 bolivars to the dollar. Accordingly, the Company revalued its remaining pending 2012 repatriation requests from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the dollar resulting in additional foreign currency losses of $19 million. The Company will recognize a $30 million special charge for these foreign currency losses in the fourth quarter of 2014. This balance also reflects the Company’s significant reduction in capacity in this market, pending further repatriation of funds and due to a decrease in demand for air travel resulting from the effective devaluation of the bolivar. The Company is continuing to work with Venezuelan authorities regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency. The Company is monitoring this situation closely and continues to evaluate its holdings of Venezuelan bolivars for additional impairment.  

   •   Fuel - For the fourth quarter 2014, AAG expects to pay an average of between $2.51 and $2.56 per gallon of mainline jet fuel (including taxes). Forecasted volume and fuel prices are provided in the tables below.  

   •   Cargo / Other Revenue - Includes cargo revenue, frequent flyer revenue, ticket change fees, excess/overweight baggage fees, first and second bag fees, contract services, simulator rental, airport clubs and inflight service revenues.  

   •   Taxes / NOL - As of December 31, 2013, AAG had approximately $10.6 billion of net operating losses (NOLs) available to reduce future federal taxable income, the majority of which are expected to be available for use in 2014. The Company also had approximately $4.7 billion of NOLs available to reduce future state taxable income, all of which are expected to be available for use in 2014. The Company’s net deferred tax asset, which includes the NOLs, is subject to a full valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2013, the tax affected valuation allowances associated with federal and state NOLs approximate $4.6 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, utilization of NOLs to offset book taxable income reduces the net deferred tax asset and results in the release of corresponding valuation allowances, which offsets the tax provision on our income statement dollar for dollar. The Company may be obligated to record and pay income tax related to certain states and foreign jurisdictions where NOLs may be limited or not available to be used. The Company currently expects this cash tax expense to be approximately $5 million or less per quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company expects to record a $24 million tax benefit resulting from a legislative change (the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014) which allows for the recovery of certain AMT amounts paid in prior years.  

   •   Labor update - On December 13, 2014 the Company reached a five-year joint collective bargaining agreement (JCBA) with its flight attendants. On December 23, 2014, the JCBA pay rates were increased by 4% due to a corporate wide initiative announced on that day. The new pay rates were effective beginning on January 1, 2015. The Company estimates that its total flight attendant costs in 2015 will be approximately $200 million higher as a result of this new agreement, of which $120M was included in prior guidance.  

On January 3, 2015, the Company reached an agreement in principle regarding a tentative agreement (TA) with its pilots on a five-year JCBA. That TA is currently subject to a membership ratification vote now scheduled to be completed by January 30. If the TA is ratified by January 30, 2015, new, higher pay rates would be implemented retroactive to December 2, 2014. The Company estimates that a ratified contract by January 30 would increase its 2015 cost of pilot compensation and benefits by approximately $650 million ($50 million for December 2014 which will be a special charge in the first quarter of 2015). If the pilots do not ratify the TA, a JCBA would be determined through binding arbitration scheduled to begin in late February. In that case, the Company would anticipate no increase in its 2015 costs of pilot compensation and benefits resulting from the new contract because the agreement between the Company and the union that represents the pilots provides that the arbitration would be limited to the determination of a cost neutral JCBA including no adjustments to pilot pay.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation  

January 12, 2015  

The Company is providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors the ability to measure financial performance excluding special items, which is more indicative of the Company’s ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. The Company believes that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel and special items and regional CASM excluding fuel and special items is useful to investors because both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond the Company’s control.
