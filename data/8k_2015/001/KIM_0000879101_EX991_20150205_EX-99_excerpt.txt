 Investment Activity  

 United States   

 As previously announced, the company purchased the interest in nine shopping centers during the fourth quarter for its wholly owned portfolio, totaling more than 1.4 million square feet, for a gross purchase price of $245.0 million. Kimco’s share of the purchase price was $158.8 million. In addition, the company acquired several land parcels totaling $114.2 million as part of four future ground-up development projects.  

 For the full year 2014, Kimco acquired interests in 60 retail properties, including 33 acquired from existing joint venture partners, totaling 6.7 million square feet. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was $1.4 billion. Kimco’s share of the purchase price was $1.1 billion.  

 During the fourth quarter, Kimco sold ownership interests in 41 properties (30 wholly owned and 11 joint ventures) in the U.S., totaling 4.5 million square feet, for a gross sales price of $492.3 million. The company’s pro-rata share from these sales was $332.2 million.  

 For the full year 2014, the company sold 91 U.S. shopping centers (62 wholly owned properties and 29 unconsolidated properties), totaling 9.6 million square feet, for a gross sales price of $1.0 billion. Kimco’s pro-rata share from these sales was $717.1 million.   

 Kimco initiated its portfolio transformation strategy in September 2010 to acquire high-quality properties with value creation opportunities in strong demographic trade areas in core markets, while disposing of assets in tertiary locations with low growth profiles. During this time, the company has successfully acquired interests in 142 shopping centers while disposing of 234 properties, leading to a 340 basis-point increase in pro-rata occupancy and an 18.2% growth in the average base rent per square foot for the portfolio.   

 Subsequent to the year end, Kimco completed the acquisition for the remaining 66.7% interest in the 39-property Kimstone portfolio from its joint venture partner, a subsidiary of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VII (BREP), for $925 million, which includes the assumption of $426.7 million in mortgage debt.  

 In January 2015, the company invested $85.3 million of new equity in the consortium that owns AB Acquisition LLC (Albertsons) to facilitate Albertsons’ recent acquisition of Safeway Inc. Kimco holds a 9.94% ownership interest in the combined company which operates 2,230 stores across 34 states and the District of Columbia operating under Safeway, Vons, Pavilions, Randalls, Tom Thumb, Carrs, Albertsons, ACME, Jewel-Osco, Lucky, Shaw’s, Star Market, Super Saver, United Supermarkets, Market Street and Amigos.   

 Mexico and South America (Latin America)   

 In the fourth quarter of 2014, Kimco sold a total of 25 properties in Latin America totaling $205.2 million with the company’s pro-rata share from these sales totaling approximately $171.9 million.  

 For the full year 2014, Kimco completed the sale of 41 properties in Latin America, totaling approximately 7.5 million square feet, for a gross sales price of $622.3 million. The company’s pro-rata share from these sales was $475.4 million.   

 These sales reflect Kimco’s strategy to simplify its operations by exiting Latin America. With the consummation of these sales, the company has substantially liquidated its portfolio in Mexico, marking the significant completion of Kimco’s goal to exit Latin America.

  FFO is a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). Given the company’s business as a real estate owner and operator, Kimco believes that FFO and FFO as adjusted is helpful to investors as a measure of its operating performance. NAREIT defines FFO as net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and (ii) extraordinary items, plus (iii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (iv) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments. Included in these items are also the company’s share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships. FFO as adjusted excludes the effects of non-operating impairments, transactional income and expenses.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  Same Property Net Operating Income ("Same Property NOI") is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance. Same Property NOI is considered by management to be an important performance measure of Kimco's operations and management believes that it is helpful to investors as a measure of Kimco's operating performance because it includes only the net operating income of properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods and excludes properties under development and pending stabilization. As such, Same Property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of Kimco's properties.   

  Same Property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rents, lease termination fees and above/below market rents) less operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense, plus Kimco's proportionate share of Same Property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. Same Property NOI includes all properties that are owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods and excludes properties under development and properties pending stabilization. Properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a projects inclusion in operating real estate.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  Projections involve numerous assumptions such as rental income (including assumptions on percentage rent), interest rates, tenant defaults, occupancy rates, foreign currency exchange rates (such as the US-Canadian rate), selling prices of properties held for disposition, expenses (including salaries and employee costs), insurance costs and numerous other factors. Not all of these factors are determinable at this time and actual results may vary from the projected results, and may be above or below the range indicated. The above range represents management’s estimate of results based upon these assumptions as of the date of this press release.
