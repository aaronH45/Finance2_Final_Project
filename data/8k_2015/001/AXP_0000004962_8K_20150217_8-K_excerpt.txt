American Express Company (the “Company”) is hereby furnishing below delinquency and write-off statistics for the lending portfolio of its U.S. Card Services (“USCS”) operating segment for the months ended November 30 and December 31, 2014 and January 31, 2015.

Delinquency and Write-off Rate Statistics 

As of and for the months ended November 30 and December 31, 2014 and January 31, 2015 

(Billions, except percentages) 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)    Net write-off rate based on principal only (i.e., excluding interest and /or fees).    

  (b)    Reflects a change in timing of charge-offs for loans in certain modification programs from 180 days past due to 120 days past due beginning January 2015. Excluding the impact of the change, the net write-off rate – principal only for the month ended January 31, 2015 was 1.3%.    

Note: The statistics presented above are based on the USCS operating segment’s total portfolio of Card Member loans determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which includes all securitized and non-securitized Card Member loans. 

The statistics presented above provide information that is additional to the data reported by the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the “Lending Trust”) in its monthly Form 10-D report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”). The Card Member loans that have been securitized through the Lending Trust do not possess identical characteristics with those of the total portfolio of USCS loans, which reflects the aggregate of securitized and non-securitized loans. Thus, the reported credit performance of the Lending Trust may, on a month-to-month basis, be better or worse than the credit performance of the total portfolio. Reported differences may arise as a result of, among other things, differences in the mix and vintage of loans between the Lending Trust and the total portfolio (including, among other things, the larger proportion of small business loans in the non-securitized portion of the total portfolio), the number of days in the reporting period covered by the Form 10-D being filed by the Lending Trust, the use of end-of-period principal loan balances to calculate write-off statistics in the Lending Trust compared to the use of average loan balances over the reporting period used in the total portfolio statistics, as well as other mechanics of the calculation for the lending trust net write-off rate, which is impacted by any additions to the securitization trust within a particular period. In addition, the reporting period for the total portfolio is based on a calendar month, as compared to the reporting period covered by the Form 10-D reports for the Lending Trust, which is generally based on a monthly period beginning on or around the 25th day of each calendar month.
