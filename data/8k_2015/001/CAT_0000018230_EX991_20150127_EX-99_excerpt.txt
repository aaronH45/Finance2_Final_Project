FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Caterpillar Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results 

PEORIA, Ill. — Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) today announced fourth-quarter 2014 sales and revenues of $14.244 billion, slightly down from $14.402 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Profit per share in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.23, compared with profit per share of $1.54 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding restructuring costs, fourth-quarter 2014 profit per share was $1.35, compared with profit per share of $1.68 in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

Sales and revenues for the full-year 2014 were $55.184 billion, down slightly from $55.656 billion in 2013. Profit per share was $5.88, up from $5.75 per share in 2013. Excluding restructuring costs, 2014 profit per share was $6.38, up from $5.97 per share in 2013. 

“Overall, we had many positives and a better year in 2014 than 2013,” said Caterpillar Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman. “Our emphasis on cost management, operational execution and cash flow helped us deliver better profit per share than both 2013 and the 2014 outlook we provided at the start of the year. At the mid-point of our original 2014 outlook, we anticipated sales and revenues of $56 billion and profit of $5.30 per share, or $5.85 per share excluding restructuring costs. We ended the year with sales and revenues within 2 percent of $56 billion and delivered much better profit per share. In addition to improved profit, Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) operating cash flow was higher than we expected and the third best year in our history,” Oberhelman said. 

“It was a great year for Energy & Transportation with record sales and profit. Sales were also up and profit improved substantially in Construction Industries. The increase in Construction Industries’ sales was primarily in North America and was partially offset by sales declines in other regions. While our construction sales were up in 2014, the industry is still well below prior peaks in every major region due to relatively weak economic growth for most of the world. Prices for key mined commodities, particularly copper, coal and iron ore, declined in 2014. Weakening commodity prices, along with improved mine productivity, led to lower sales for Resource

Industries. We haven’t seen evidence of an upturn in equipment orders yet—and sales of mining equipment remain depressed,” Oberhelman added. 

“We are disappointed that we missed our profit outlook in the fourth quarter. That said, 2014 overall was a successful year as we continued to execute on the things we can control. Our overall market position for machines improved for the fourth consecutive year; the quality of the machines delivered to customers was better; safety in our factories continued to improve and inventory turns were better. Our balance sheet is strong, and we repurchased $4.2 billion of stock in 2014 and raised the quarterly dividend by 17 percent,” Oberhelman said. 

2015 Outlook 

We expect world economic growth to only improve modestly in 2015. The relatively slow growth in the world economy and continued weakness in commodity prices—particularly oil, copper, coal and iron ore—are expected to be negative for our sales. We expect sales and revenues in 2015 to be about $50 billion. To provide a better understanding of our expectations for 2015 profit, we are providing our outlook with and without anticipated restructuring costs. Over the past two years, we have undertaken restructuring activities designed to lower our long-term cost structure. Additional restructuring actions are anticipated in our outlook for 2015. In total, we expect the cost of these restructuring actions in 2015 to be about $150 million or about $0.15 per share. Our profit outlook for 2015 is about $4.60 per share, or $4.75 per share excluding restructuring costs. 

“The recent dramatic decline in the price of oil is the most significant reason for the year-over-year decline in our sales and revenues outlook. Current oil prices are a significant headwind for Energy & Transportation and negative for our construction business in the oil producing regions of the world. In addition, with lower prices for copper, coal and iron ore, we’ve reduced our expectations for sales of mining equipment. We’ve also lowered our expectations for construction equipment sales in China. While our market position in China has improved, 2015 expectations for the construction industry in China are lower,” Oberhelman said. 

“While we are, without a doubt, facing a tough year in 2015, we’re driving cost management through additional restructuring actions and continued operational improvements gained from our focus on Lean Management. While 2015 will be difficult, the work we’ve done to improve our cost structure, market position and quality will position us for better results when the world economy and the key industries we serve improve,” Oberhelman added.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 

Consolidated Sales and Revenues 

The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between the fourth quarter of 2013 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2014 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. 

Sales and Revenues 

Total sales and revenues were $14.244 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $14.402 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013, a decline of $158 million or 1 percent. The decrease was primarily due to currency impacts from weakening of the euro and Japanese yen. The impacts from sales volume, price realization and Financial Products’ revenues were not significant. While sales for new equipment were slightly lower, aftermarket parts sales were slightly higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. 

While the overall sales change was not significant, sales in North America improved and were about offset by declines in Asia/Pacific and Latin America. In North America, sales increased 10 percent due to higher demand primarily for transportation and oil and gas applications, and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Asia/Pacific sales declined 16 percent primarily due to lower demand for construction equipment and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Sales decreased 14 percent in Latin America primarily due to lower end-user demand for construction and mining equipment, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Sales in EAME were about flat as increases in deliveries to end users were about offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories and the impact of currency as our sales in euros translated into fewer U.S. dollars. 

By segment, sales decreases in Construction Industries and Resource Industries were about offset by increased sales in Energy & Transportation. Construction Industries’ sales decreased 9 percent primarily due to lower dealer deliveries to end users. Resource Industries’ sales declined 10 percent primarily due to lower end-user demand for mining equipment, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Energy & Transportation’s sales increased 11 percent primarily due to higher demand for oil and gas, transportation and power generation applications, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Financial Products’ segment revenues were about flat.

Consolidated Operating Profit 

The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between the fourth quarter of 2013 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2014 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses. 

Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.063 billion, down $389 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline was primarily due to increased selling, general and administrative and research and development (SG&A and R&D) expenses and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable price realization. 

A majority of the increase in SG&A and R&D expenses was for new product introduction programs and higher incentive compensation expense. In addition, SG&A expenses were higher as a result of the timing of spending on company-wide initiatives. 

About two-thirds of the unfavorable change in manufacturing costs was related to inventory—the absence of LIFO inventory decrement benefits of $115 million from the fourth quarter of 2013 and the unfavorable impact of cost absorption, as inventory declined more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 than in the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, incentive compensation expense and warranty, as well as spending on growth-related programs in Energy & Transportation, increased. These items were partially offset by favorable material costs. 

Restructuring costs of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 were related to a reduction in workforce at our Gosselies, Belgium, facility and several other restructuring programs across the company. In the fourth quarter of 2013, restructuring costs were $130 million, primarily related to our mining business. 

Fourth-quarter 2013 operating profit included a gain on a legal settlement of $68 million. 

Other Profit/Loss Items 

· Other income/expense was income of $3 million compared with income of $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The unfavorable change was primarily due to lower gains on the sale of securities in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2014 included losses on commodity forward contracts. 

· The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2014 reflects an effective tax rate of 28 percent, compared with 28.5 percent for fourth quarter of 2013, excluding the items discussed below. 

The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2014 also includes benefits of $62 million. This is related to a decrease from the third-quarter estimated annual effective tax rate of 29.5 percent primarily due to 

7 

the renewal in the fourth quarter of the U.S. research and development tax credit for 2014 and $23 million for the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a non-U.S. subsidiary. This compares to a $19 million benefit recorded for the fourth quarter of 2013 related to a decrease from the third-quarter 2013 estimated annual effective tax rate. 

Global Workforce 

Caterpillar worldwide full-time employment was 114,233 at the end of 2014, compared with 118,501 at the end of 2013, or a decrease of 4,268 full-time employees. The flexible workforce increased 1,657, resulting in a total decrease in the global workforce of 2,611. The decrease was primarily the result of restructuring programs.

1 Does not include inter-segment sales of $52 million and $73 million in the fourth quarter 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Construction Industries’ sales were $4.420 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $449 million, or 9 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease in sales was due to lower volume and the unfavorable impact of currency primarily the Japanese yen and the euro. These unfavorable items were partially offset by improved price realization. Sales of new equipment decreased, while sales of aftermarket parts were about flat. 

· The sales volume decrease was primarily related to lower deliveries to end users. About one-third of the decline in sales volume was due to the absence of a large government order in Brazil that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013. 

· Price realization was favorable. About half of the overall improvement was due to the absence of the same large government order in Brazil that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013. 

Sales decreased in all regions except North America. 

· In Asia/Pacific, the sales decline was primarily due to lower sales in China and Japan. In China, the lower sales resulted from weaker construction activity. In Japan, sales during the fourth quarter of 2013 were favorably impacted by customer demand in advance of a 2014 emissions change. Sales in Japan also declined due to a weaker Japanese yen as sales in yen translated into fewer U.S. dollars. 

· Decreases in Latin America were primarily related to the absence of a large government order in Brazil that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 and weak construction activity. 

· In EAME, the sales decline was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as dealers reduced inventory more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 than in the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, the impact of currency was unfavorable as sales in euros translated into fewer U.S. dollars. 

· Sales increased in North America primarily due to higher end-user demand as construction-related spending increased in the United States. Although still below prior peaks, construction-related spending continues to improve. In addition, the impact of changes in dealer inventories was favorable. 

11 

Construction Industries’ profit was $362 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $489 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Profit decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, increased incentive compensation expense and higher spending on new product introduction programs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the favorable impacts of currency and price realization.

1 Does not include inter-segment sales of $183 million and $109 million in the fourth quarter 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Resource Industries’ sales were $2.385 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $264 million, or 10 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to lower sales volume. While sales of new equipment continued to decline, sales of aftermarket parts improved. 

The sales volume decrease was primarily related to lower end-user demand. This decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. While dealers continued to reduce inventories during the fourth quarter of 2014, the reductions were less significant than in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

Sales decreased in all geographic regions except Asia/Pacific. Sales in Asia/Pacific were about flat, reflecting continued weak end-user demand. Although prices of some mined commodities remained above investment thresholds, customers in most geographic regions continued to reduce spending. We believe that mining companies are increasing productivity at existing mines and improving their transportation infrastructure rather than investing in expansions or new mine openings, which results in lower demand for our mining products. In addition, projects started in prior years have led to an increased supply of coal and iron ore which has outpaced demand and resulted in prices below investment thresholds for those commodities. As a result, new orders for mining equipment continued to be weak in the quarter. 

Resource Industries’ profit was $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $217 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease was primarily the result of increased SG&A and R&D expenses, mostly due to higher spending for new product introduction programs and increased incentive compensation expense. In addition, sales volume and currency impacts were unfavorable. These items were partially offset by favorable material costs. 

12 

Inter-segment sales of components to Energy & Transportation increased substantially and about $45 million of Resource Industries’ profit in the fourth quarter of 2014 was related to these inter-segment sales, an increase of about $40 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. 

Segment profit for 2014 is based on fixed exchange rates set at the beginning of 2014, while segment profit for 2013 is based on fixed exchange rates set at the beginning of 2013. The difference in these fixed exchange rates resulted in an unfavorable currency impact for Resource Industries.

1 Does not include inter-segment sales of $542 million and $567 million in the fourth quarter 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Energy & Transportation’s sales were $6.191 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $626 million, or 11 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales increased for oil and gas, power generation and transportation applications and decreased for industrial applications. 

· Oil and Gas — Sales increases in North America and EAME were partially offset by declines in Latin America and Asia/Pacific. In North America, sales increased primarily due to higher end-user demand and the favorable impact from changes in dealer inventory. Increases in end-user demand were primarily for equipment used in well servicing, gas compression and drilling applications. The sales increase in EAME was primarily due to the timing of large projects. In Latin America, lower sales were primarily due to weaker end-user demand. Sales declined in Asia/Pacific primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventory, partially offset by higher deliveries to end users. 

· Power Generation — Sales increased in EAME and North America and were about flat in Latin America and Asia/Pacific. Sales improved in EAME primarily due to sales recognition for a large project. In North America, sales increased primarily due to higher end-user demand. 

· Transportation — Sales increased in EAME and North America and were about flat in Latin America and Asia/Pacific. In EAME, sales increased as we continue to focus on expansion of our rail business. In North America, sales strengthened due to customer demand in advance of the 2015 emissions change for locomotives. 

13 

· Industrial — Sales decreased in EAME and were about flat in all other geographic regions. In EAME, sales decreased primarily due to lower demand for engines used by original equipment manufacturers for agriculture applications. 

Energy & Transportation’s profit was $1.077 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $982 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The improvement was primarily due to higher sales volume, which included negative product mix due to sales recognition for a large power generation project in EAME. In addition, price realization was favorable. These favorable items were partially offset by increased spending on growth-related programs. 

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS SEGMENT 

(Millions of dollars) 

Revenues by Geographic Region 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Profit 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Financial Products’ revenues were $811 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $5 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline was primarily due to lower average financing rates in North America and Europe and lower average earning assets in Asia/Pacific, partially offset by higher average earning assets in North America. 

Financial Products’ profit was $197 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with $266 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The unfavorable change was primarily due to a $25 million increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial (largely a result of the absence of a favorable adjustment that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013), a $17 million decrease in gains on sales of securities at Caterpillar Financial Insurance Services and the absence of a $17 million currency gain that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 at Cat Financial. 

At the end of 2014, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.17 percent compared with 2.81 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2014 and 2.37 percent at the end of 2013. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $104 million for the full-year 2014, compared with $123 million for the full-year 2013. 

As of December 31, 2014, Cat Financial’s allowance for credit losses totaled $401 million, or 1.36 percent of net finance receivables, compared with $378 million or 1.30 percent of net finance receivables at year-end 2013. 

Corporate Items and Eliminations 

Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $742 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $165 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for ME&T, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates and inter-segment eliminations. 

14 

The increase in expense from the fourth quarter of 2013 was primarily due to higher corporate costs, the absence of a LIFO inventory decrement benefit of $115 million and a gain on a legal settlement of $68 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by lower retirement benefits and other methodology differences. 

2015 Outlook 

From an economic perspective, the company does not anticipate significant improvement in the world economy. The company expects world GDP growth of about 2.7 percent in 2015, up from about 2.5 percent in 2014. The company believes that the improvement will come primarily from developed countries and that economies in developing countries will, overall, grow at a rate similar to 2014. 

Despite our outlook for modest improvement in global economic growth, significant risks and uncertainties remain that could temper growth in 2015. Political conflicts and social unrest continue to disrupt economic activity in several regions, in particular, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa and the Middle East. The Chinese government’s push for structural reforms is slowing growth, and the ongoing uncertainty around the direction and timing of U.S. fiscal and monetary policy actions may temper business confidence. In addition, over the last several months, the price of oil has declined substantially. The depth and duration of the price decline will influence the impact of our 2015 results. 

Sales and Revenues Outlook 

While we anticipate modest improvement in world economic growth, we expect our sales and revenues to decline from $55.2 billion in 2014 to about $50 billion in 2015. The primary factors contributing to the decline include: 

· Lower oil prices are the most significant reason we expect lower sales in 2015. About one-third of Energy & Transportation’s sales in 2014 were related to oil and gas. Based on the recent sharp decline in oil prices, we expect sales of reciprocating engines will be significantly lower than in 2014. In addition to the impact in Energy & Transportation, we expect lower oil prices will be negative for Construction Industries’ sales in oil-producing countries around the world, including some regions of the United States that rely heavily on oil revenues to drive economic growth. 

· We believe lower oil prices will be positive for consumers around the world and act like a fiscal stimulus for net oil importing countries. While this should be positive for world economic growth, we do not believe it will occur soon enough to have a significant impact on our 2015 sales. 

· In addition to oil, prices for many mined commodities have also declined. Copper, coal and iron ore prices have continued to decline. Order rates for mining equipment have remained at low levels and we do not expect recovery in 2015. Because of the weakening commodity prices and low order rates, we expect our mining sales will be lower in 2015. 

· The U.S. dollar has strengthened over the past several months and is expected to negatively impact 2015 sales. 

· We also expect that sales in our rail business will be lower. As a result of a strong rail industry and customers purchasing locomotives in advance of the 2015 emissions change in North America, 2014 was a particularly good year for locomotive sales. We expect that locomotive sales in 2015 will be lower. 

· We have also lowered our expectations for construction equipment sales in China. While our market position in China has improved, 2015 expectations for the construction industry in China are lower. 

· By segment, we expect sales to decline from 2014 by 5 to 10 percent for Construction Industries, about 10 percent for Resource Industries and 10 to 15 percent for Energy & Transportation. 

Profit Outlook 

As a result of the expected decline in sales and revenues, we expect lower profit in 2015. Our outlook for profit is about $4.60 per share, or $4.75 per share excluding restructuring costs of about $150 million or about $0.15 per share. That compares to profit of $5.88 per share, or $6.38 excluding restructuring costs in 2014.

Our target for incremental operating profit as a percent of incremental sales is 25 percent, and our target “decremental margin” rate when sales decline is a range of 25 to 30 percent. The 2015 outlook excluding restructuring costs is within the 25 to 30 percent range. 

While the profit outlook is consistent with our decremental operating profit target range, there are a number of positive and negative factors. 

Positive Factors: 

· Lower incentive compensation expense — in 2014 incentive compensation expense was significantly higher than target as we substantially exceeded our 2014 incentive compensation metrics. 

· Lower variable costs — as a result of our continuing work improving costs and efficiency, material and variable labor and overhead costs are expected to be favorable. 

· Lower restructuring costs — while we are continuing restructuring actions in 2015 to improve our long-term cost structure, the costs expected in 2015 are lower than the $441 million of restructuring costs in 2014. In 2015, we are expecting restructuring costs of about $150 million. 

· The strength of the U.S. dollar, while negative for sales, is positive for costs and overall is expected to be positive to profit. 

· We expect a small improvement in price realization (less than 0.5 percent of sales). 

Negative Factors: 

· Higher R&D expense. 

· Unfavorable cost absorption — we expect more reduction in inventory in 2015 than in 2014. While positive for cash flow, it would have a negative impact on costs. 

· With a greater proportion of the expected decline in sales occurring in higher margin products for the oil and gas and mining industries, we anticipate an unfavorable impact on operating margin. 

· Higher pension expense. 

· Higher tax rate - We had $44 million of net favorable discrete tax items in 2014 that we do not expect in 2015. Our outlook for 2015 assumes a tax rate of 29 percent. Excluding the discrete items, the tax rate was 28 percent in 2014. The increase in the rate is primarily related to the expiration of the U.S. research and development tax credit.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

Q1: Oil and gas prices have changed dramatically over the last six months. Can you discuss how these changes are impacting your sales? 

A: Caterpillar sells products that are used in a variety of different oil and gas applications, including offshore and land drilling, well servicing, oil and gas production and gas compression. The products we sell to the oil and gas industry include gas turbines and centrifugal natural gas compressors, reciprocating engines, transmissions and well stimulation pumps. Although we are confident in the long-term fundamentals of the oil and gas industry, in the near term and especially in the latter part of 2015, we expect the substantial decline in oil prices will have a negative impact on our sales. We expect that well servicing and drilling will be impacted the earliest and to the greatest magnitude. Gas compression, due to the continued need for global infrastructure build, is expected to remain relatively strong in 2015 and sales related to large projects that take years to execute will likely be impacted to a lesser extent in the short-term. 

In addition to Energy & Transportation, we support the oil and gas industry directly with construction and mining equipment—such as sales of equipment for drill site preparation and infrastructure development and sales of mining equipment to the Canadian oil sands. There are also a variety of indirect exposures, as countries that depend on oil revenues may reduce expenditures for roads and other infrastructure projects. 

Lower oil and gas prices are having a substantial negative impact on our outlook for sales and revenues. While we believe lower oil prices will be positive for consumers around the world and act like a fiscal stimulus for net oil importing countries, we do not think the positive impact to the overall economy will occur soon enough to have a significant impact on our 2015 sales. 

Q2: Can you discuss changes in dealer inventories—for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014 and your expectations for 2015? 

A: Dealer machine and engine inventories decreased about $600 million in both the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year of 2014, dealer machine and engine inventories decreased about $1 billion compared with a decrease of more than $3 billion during 2013. 

We expect that dealers will continue to reduce inventories in 2015 as they align inventory levels with expected demand. 

Q3: Can you comment on the substantial decline in your inventory in the fourth quarter of 2014 and your expectations for 2015? 

A: Our inventory declined $1.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2014. A fourth-quarter decline is not unusual as some of our businesses have seasonally higher sales in the fourth quarter. 

While an inventory decline in the fourth quarter is not unusual, the magnitude of the fourth-quarter decline in 2014 was larger than we expected. This contributed to our profit being lower than our outlook as we experienced a more significant unfavorable impact from inventory cost absorption. 

During the quarter, production levels were lower than previously expected as we began preparing for weakening macro-economic factors in several of our businesses. In addition, year-end inventory in our Product Distribution Centers (PDCs) was lower than we expected. 

For 2015, we are anticipating lower sales, which is expected to lead to a larger inventory reduction in 2015 than in 2014. That said, as we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014, our inventory balance is impacted by future expectations. While we are expecting 2015 inventory to decline, as the year unfolds and we have a better view of 2016, it could affect our ending inventory in 2015. 

17 

Q4: Can you comment on expense related to your short-term incentive compensation plans and your expectations for 2015? 

A: Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually. The fourth-quarter 2014 expense was about $310 million and was about $1.3 billion for the full year. Short-term incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2013 was about $200 million, and full-year 2013 was about $545 million. 

For 2015, our outlook reflects short-term incentive compensation expense of about $900 million. 

Q5: Can you comment on your year-end 2014 order backlog? 

A: At the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, the order backlog was $17.3 billion. This represents a $2.4 billion reduction from the end of the third quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily in Energy & Transportation. In addition, the order backlog for both Resource Industries and Construction Industries declined. 

Compared to year-end 2013, the order backlog declined about $700 million. Decreases in Resource Industries were partially offset by increases in Energy & Transportation. 

Q6: Can you comment on your balance sheet and ME&T operating cash flow in 2014? 

A: ME&T operating cash flow for the full year of 2014 was $7.5 billion compared with $9.0 billion in 2013. The decrease was primarily the result of the absence of the significant inventory decline that occurred during 2013. 

Our top cash deployment priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of our “mid-A” credit rating. The ME&T debt-to-capital ratio was 37.4 percent, up from 29.7 percent at the end of 2013 but within our target range of 30 to 45 percent. The increase was primarily due to a return of capital to stockholders of $5.8 billion ($4.2 billion stock repurchase and $1.6 billion dividends) and an unfavorable year-end adjustment to equity of $1.6 billion for retirement benefits. These items were partially offset by profit. Our cash and liquidity positions remained strong with an enterprise cash balance of $7.3 billion at December 31, 2014. 

Our priorities for the use of cash are to maintain a strong financial position in support of our credit rating, provide capital to support growth, appropriately fund employee benefit plans, pay dividends and repurchase common stock. During the year, capital expenditures totaled $1.6 billion and funding for defined benefit pension plans was $0.7 billion. 

Q7: What are your plans for share repurchases in 2015? 

A: In the first quarter of 2014, the Board of Directors approved a $10 billion authorization which expires in December 2018. At the end of 2014, we had $7.5 billion remaining in the authorization. Our strong balance sheet and cash position provide us with the ability to repurchase additional stock. We expect our repurchase activity to be consistent with our stated cash deployment priorities and are considering additional repurchases in 2015. 

Q8: What were your total restructuring costs in 2014? What are plans for 2015? 

A: Restructuring costs for 2014 were $441 million, the most significant item was related to a reduction in workforce at our Gosselies, Belgium, facility. The remaining costs were for a wide range of actions across the company as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations. 

In 2015, we will continue to incur costs related to programs started in 2014 and we expect to take additional actions to further improve our long-term cost structure. Our 2015 outlook assumes restructuring costs of about $150 million. 

18 

Q9: In your third-quarter financial release, you announced a 2015 preliminary sales and revenues outlook of flat to slightly up from 2014. In your fourth-quarter financial release, you lowered your outlook for 2015 sales and revenues. What is driving this change? 

A: The substantial and continued decline in oil prices is the most significant reason for the decrease in our sales and revenues outlook. Lower oil prices are negative for Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries. In addition, prices for mined commodities such as copper, coal and iron ore have continued to decline, and order rates for mining equipment have remained at low levels. As a result, we have reduced our expectations for Resource Industries. We have also lowered our forecast for the China construction industry and our expectation for sales in China. Lastly, the U.S. dollar has strengthened over the last three months and is expected to negatively impact 2015 sales.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The following definition is provided for “non-GAAP financial measures” in connection with Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This non-GAAP financial measure has no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore is unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend this item to be considered in isolation or substituted for the related GAAP measure. 

Profit Per Share Excluding Restructuring Costs 

We incurred significant restructuring costs in 2014 and expect to incur additional restructuring costs in 2015. We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit per share impact of restructuring costs in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. We have also provided 2013 profit per share excluding restructuring costs comparable to the 2014 and 2015 presentation. Reconciliation of profit per share excluding restructuring costs to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, profit per share is as follows: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]
