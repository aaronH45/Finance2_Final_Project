 —   Diluted earnings per share of $2.36  

 —   Net sales of $3.2 billion  

 —   Net cash from operating activities of $520 million  

 —   Book-to-bill ratio of 1.05x on a 14% increase in funded orders to $3.4 billion  

 —   Updated 2015 financial guidance  

NEW YORK, January 29, 2015 – L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LLL) today reported diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) of $2.36 for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 (2014 fourth quarter), compared to $2.04 for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 (2013 fourth quarter). The 2014 fourth quarter included: (1) tax benefits of $0.26 per diluted share related to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. Federal research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit in December 2014 and (2) a charge of $0.17 per diluted share in the Electronic Systems segment related to a product specifications matter. Net sales of $3.2 billion for the 2014 fourth quarter decreased by 1% compared to the 2013 fourth quarter.  

“Across L-3, our dedicated employees contributed to a solid fourth quarter by focusing on program execution and productivity improvements,” said Michael T. Strianese, chairman, president and chief executive officer. “We penetrated new markets and capitalized on emerging opportunities, as evidenced by strong funded orders of $3.4 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05x.”  

“We also continued to execute our disciplined portfolio reshaping and cash allocation strategy. During the quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Hamburg-based Marine Systems International (L-3 MSI) business to Wärtsilä Corporation. We continue to evaluate our portfolio to address the needs of a dynamic and demanding marketplace and to strengthen our core business as demonstrated by our acquisition of MITEQ, Inc. in January 2015, which adds key products to our Communication Systems segment and further expands our customer base. We also delivered value to our shareholders during 2014 by repurchasing $823 million of our common stock and paying dividends of $208 million, for a total of $1 billion of cash returned to our shareholders.”  

Key competitive wins for the quarter included contracts: (1) with the National Security Agency’s (NSA) Enterprise Program Management (EPM) to provide systems engineering, acquisition planning, program management and financial management for two of NSA’s major mission areas, (2) to provide the U.S. Army Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) with engineering and logistics support, (3) with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) – United Nations to design, manufacture and install a Hydrographic Data Acquisition System (HDAS) range off of Crozet Island, France, (4) to provide the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Presidential Guard with MX-15D Targeting Systems for Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Armament Control System (ACS) in support of its border patrol program and (5) to provide a digital cockpit upgrade for the U.S. Army’s UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter.

L-3 Consolidated Results  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth Quarter Results of Operations: For the 2014 fourth quarter, consolidated net sales of $3.2 billion decreased $26 million, or 1%, compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Sales to the U.S. Government, including sales from acquired businesses(1) of $20 million, declined 2%, or $46 million, to $2,208 million in the 2014 fourth quarter, compared to $2,254 million in the 2013 fourth quarter. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net sales to international and commercial customers of 2%, or $20 million, to $1.0 billion in the 2014 fourth quarter, compared to $980 million in the 2013 fourth quarter. Net sales to international and commercial customers, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, increased to 31% for the 2014 fourth quarter as compared to 30% for the 2013 fourth quarter.  

Operating income for the 2014 fourth quarter of $303 million decreased $3 million, or 1%, compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Operating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin) decreased by 10 basis points to 9.4% for the 2014 fourth quarter compared to 9.5% for the 2013 fourth quarter. Operating margin decreased by 60 basis points due to a charge of $18 million in the Electronic Systems segment related to a product specifications matter and 20 basis points primarily due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments in the Aerospace Systems segment. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 70 basis points due to lower pension expense of $23 million. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends.  

Interest and other income, net, decreased due to a loss recorded on the sale of a business within the Warrior Systems sector of the Electronic Systems segment of $3 million.  

The effective tax rate for the 2014 fourth quarter decreased to 19.8% from 29.3% primarily due to $22 million for the retroactive reinstatement in December 2014 of the U.S. Federal R&E tax credit.  

Net income attributable to L-3 in the 2014 fourth quarter increased 10% to $203 million compared to the 2013 fourth quarter, and diluted EPS increased 16% to $2.36 from $2.04. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the 2014 fourth quarter declined by 5% compared to the 2013 fourth quarter primarily due to repurchases of L-3 common stock.  

Full Year Results of Operations: For the year ended December 31, 2014, consolidated net sales of $12.1 billion decreased $498 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Sales to the U.S. Government, including sales from acquired businesses of $78 million, declined 7%, or $602 million, to $8,584 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $9,186 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net sales to international and commercial customers of 3%, or $104 million, to $3,540 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $3,436 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. Net sales to international and commercial customers, as a percentage of consolidated net sales,  

 (1)  Net sales from acquired businesses are comprised of: (i) net sales from business acquisitions that are included in L-3’s actual results for less than 12 months, less (ii) net sales from business and product line divestitures that are included in L-3’s actual results for the 12 months prior to the divestitures.  

 L-3 Announces Results for the 2014 Fourth Quarter    Page 3  

 increased to 29% for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2013.  

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $1,085 million decreased $127 million, or 10%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 8.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating margin decreased by: (1) 120 basis points due to lower sales and mix changes and unfavorable contract performance adjustments in the Aerospace Systems segment, and $25 million of outside accounting and legal advisory costs incurred in connection with the previously disclosed internal review of the Aerospace Systems segment (Internal Review), (2) 20 basis points due to a charge of $18 million in the Electronic Systems segment related to a product specifications matter and (3) 10 basis points due to higher overhead expenses and lower sales in the National Security Solutions (NSS) segment. These decreases were partially offset by lower pension expense of $94 million, which increased operating margin by 80 basis points. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends.  

Interest and other income, net, decreased due to a loss recorded on the sale of a business within the Warrior Systems sector of the Electronic Systems segment of $3 million.  

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased to 26.8% from 28.0% primarily due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings.  

Net income attributable to L-3 in the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased 12% to $664 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, and diluted EPS decreased 8% to $7.56 from $8.24. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2014 declined by 4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to repurchases of L-3 common stock.  

Orders: Funded orders for the 2014 fourth quarter were $3.4 billion, an increase of 14% compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Funded orders for the year ended December 31, 2014 remained substantially the same at $12.1 billion. Funded backlog decreased 1% to $10.2 billion at December 31, 2014 compared to $10.4 billion at December 31, 2013.  

Cash Flow and Cash Returned to Shareholders: Net cash from operating activities decreased by $126 million, or 20%, to $520 million for the 2014 fourth quarter, compared to $646 million for the 2013 fourth quarter. The decrease in net cash from operating activities was due to a lower decrease in working capital in the 2014 fourth quarter compared to the 2013 fourth quarter, primarily related to billed receivables and contracts in process.  

Net cash from operating activities decreased by $138 million, or 11%, to $1,125 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1,263 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in net cash from operating activities was due to the decrease in net income and an increase in working capital, partially offset by lower payments for income taxes. The increase in working capital is primarily due to a use of cash for trade accounts payable.  

The table below summarizes the cash returned to shareholders during the 2014 and 2013 fourth quarters and the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less net capital expenditures (capital expenditures less cash proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment) plus income tax payments attributable to discontinued operations. Free cash flow represents cash generated after paying for interest on borrowings, income taxes, pension benefit contributions, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, but before repaying principal amount of outstanding debt, paying cash dividends on common stock, repurchasing shares of our common stock, investing cash to acquire businesses, and making other strategic investments. Thus, a key assumption underlying free cash flow is that the company will be able to refinance its existing debt. Because of this assumption, free cash flow is not a measure that should be relied upon to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.

Reportable Segment Results  

Electronic Systems  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth Quarter: Electronic Systems net sales for the 2014 fourth quarter increased by $80 million, or 6%, compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Sales increased: (1) $40 million for Warrior Systems primarily due to increased deliveries of night vision goggles to foreign militaries and the U.S. Army, (2) $25 million for Sensor Systems due to increased deliveries of EO/IR turrets primarily to international customers and (3) $18 million for Precision Engagement & Training primarily due to timing of deliveries of ordnance products to the U.S. military. The Mustang Technology Group acquisition in December 2013 increased sales by $13 million. These increases were partially offset by sales decreases of $16 million primarily for Power & Propulsion Systems due to lower sales volume for undersea warfare products and maritime automation systems to foreign ministries of defense.  

Electronic Systems operating income for the 2014 fourth quarter increased by $9 million, or 6%, compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Operating margin of 11.6% remained the same. Operating margin decreased by 130 basis points due to a charge of $18 million related to a product specifications matter. This decrease was partially offset by increases of: (1) 70 basis points primarily due to higher sales and mix changes, primarily for Aviation Products, Warrior Systems and Marine Systems International and (2) 60 basis points due to lower pension expense of $8 million.  

Full Year: Electronic Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $19 million, or 0.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Sales increased: (1) $38 million for Security & Detection Systems due to increased volume for airport security system products from international customers and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), (2) $28 million for Marine Systems International due to timing of deliveries of shipbuilding products to a foreign navy and commercial customers, (3) $27 million for Power & Propulsion Systems primarily due to increased volume on certain contracts including an engine production contract to a foreign military and missile targets to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), partially offset by lower volume on undersea warfare products and (4) $14 million primarily for Warrior Systems due to increased deliveries of night vision goggles to foreign militaries and the U.S. Army, partially offset by lower demand for holographic weapons sights for the commercial sporting and recreational markets. The Mustang Technology Group acquisition increased sales by $41 million. These increases were partially offset by sales decreases of: (1) $65 million for Precision Engagement & Training due to reduced deliveries of U.S. Army rotary wing training systems for the Flight School XXI program, lower volume for upgrades for F/A-18 flight simulator trainers and completed contracts for guidance products for the U.S. Army, and (2) $64 million for Sensor Systems primarily due to lower volume for airborne EO/IR turrets to the U.S. military due to the drawdown from Afghanistan, and the completion of a contract for force protection products for a foreign ministry of defense.  

Electronic Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $4 million, or 0.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating margin of 11.6% remained the same.

Fourth Quarter: Aerospace Systems net sales for the 2014 fourth quarter increased by $13 million, or 1%, compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Sales increased $8 million for Platform and Logistics Solutions and $5 million for ISR Systems. Platform and Logistics Solutions sales increased due to higher volume for foreign military aircraft modification contracts, including the Australia C-27J aircraft, partially offset primarily by lower volume for: (1) the U.S. Air Force (USAF) due to the Department of Defense’s (DoD) retirement of the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) and the DoD’s planned reduction of the Compass Call aircraft fleet and (2) reduced deliveries of aircraft cabin assemblies and subassemblies. The increase in sales for ISR Systems was primarily due to higher volume for small ISR aircraft systems to a foreign government.  

Aerospace Systems operating income for the 2014 fourth quarter increased by $2 million, or 2%, compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Operating margin increased by 10 basis points to 8.0%. Operating margin increased by 80 basis points due to lower pension expense of $9 million. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable contract performance adjustments primarily on an international head-of-state aircraft modification contract, which decreased operating margin by 70 basis points.  

Full Year: Aerospace Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $230 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Sales decreased $205 million for Platform and Logistics Solutions and $25 million for ISR Systems. Platform and Logistics Solutions sales decreased: (1) $89 million due to lower volume to the USAF from the DoD’s retirement of the JCA and the DoD’s planned reduction in the Compass Call aircraft fleet, (2) $89 million due to lower volume for aircraft modifications for the U.S. Navy maritime patrol aircraft due to the transition to a new aircraft platform and international head-of-state aircraft, (3) $59 million primarily due to lower volume for the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) and commercial contracts nearing completion, (4) $48 million due to reduced deliveries of aircraft cabin assemblies and subassemblies and (5) $7 million primarily due to decreased volume for field maintenance and sustainment services for USAF training aircraft. These decreases were partially offset by a sales increase of $55 million for the Australia C-27J aircraft and $32 million primarily due to higher volume for foreign military aircraft modification contracts. ISR Systems sales declined primarily due to lower sales and volume for small ISR aircraft and aircraft systems due to the U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan.  

Aerospace Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $138 million, or 32%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating margin declined by 270 basis points to 6.7%. Operating margin declined by: (1) 170 basis points primarily due to lower sales and mix changes, (2) 80 basis points due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments on modification contracts for international head-of-state and search and rescue aircraft, (3) 60 basis points due to $25 million of charges for outside accounting and legal advisory costs incurred in connection with the Internal Review and (4) 40 basis points primarily due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments on a number of contracts for aircraft cabin assemblies.

NSS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth Quarter: NSS net sales for the 2014 fourth quarter decreased by $46 million, or 15%, compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Sales declined by: (1) $33 million for Defense Solutions primarily due to lower demand and contracts nearing completion, (2) $14 million for Federal Solutions primarily due to completed contracts and (3) $8 million primarily for Intelligence Solutions due to work scope reductions on a technical support contract for a U.S. Government agency as a result of U.S. Government budget reductions. The Data Tactics acquisition increased sales by $9 million.  

NSS operating income for the 2014 fourth quarter decreased by $11 million, or 58%, compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Operating margin decreased by 310 basis points to 3.0%. Operating margin decreased by: (1) 200 basis points due to higher business development, marketing and selling expenses, and lower sales and higher overhead expense rates caused by delayed contract awards for international contracts and protests on contracts with the U.S. Government, (2) 70 basis points due to favorable contract performance adjustments in the 2013 fourth quarter not recurring in the 2014 fourth quarter and (3) 40 basis points primarily due to lower margins on new business and recompetitions due to competitive pricing pressure.  

Full Year: NSS net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $86 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.

Financial Guidance  

Based on information known as of today, the company has updated its consolidated and segment financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2015. A 2015 preliminary outlook was previously provided on October 30, 2014. All financial guidance amounts are estimates subject to change in the future, including as a result of matters discussed under the “Forward-Looking Statements” cautionary language beginning on page 10 and the impact, if any, of the litigation and investigations relating to the matters subject to our Internal Review. The company undertakes no duty to update its guidance.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The consolidated 2015 guidance assumes:  

   —   Sales of $55 million from the acquisition of MITEQ on January 21, 2015,  

   —   A net pension expense increase of $59 million to $29 million for 2015 compared to $30 million net pension income for 2014. This estimated increase in net pension expense will reduce 2015 operating margin by approximately 50 basis points and diluted EPS by $0.45. The increase in pension expense is due to: (i) $50 million related to an 89 basis point decline in the estimated weighted average discount rate to 4.14% from 5.03% at December 31, 2013 and (ii) $12 million due to the reduction of 2015 recoverable pension costs under Government Cost Accounting Standards as a result of the passage of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014, partially offset by a decrease of $3 million primarily due to other changes in assumptions,  

 L-3 Announces Results for the 2014 Fourth Quarter   Page 9  

   —   The increase in the net pension expense in the 2015 segment financial guidance is a reduction in operating income and margin of: (i) $13 million and 30 basis points for Electronic Systems, (ii) $27 million and 70 basis points for Aerospace Systems, (iii) $18 million and 90 basis points for Communication Systems and (iv) $1 million and 10 basis points for NSS,  

   —   The R&E tax credit that expired on December 31, 2014 is not re-enacted for 2015. If re-enacted for 2015, the annual R&E tax credit would reduce the effective tax rate by 220 basis points and increase diluted EPS by $0.24,  

   —   Share repurchases of $500 million,  

   —   Excludes any potential non-cash goodwill impairment charges for which the information is presently unknown,  

   —   Excludes potential litigation charges and additional expenses relating to the Internal Review at Aerospace Systems, which was completed in October 2014, and  

   —   Excludes the impact of the divestiture of L-3 MSI, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015.  

Additional financial information regarding the 2014 fourth quarter and full year results and the 2015 financial guidance is available on the company’s website at www.L-3com.com.
