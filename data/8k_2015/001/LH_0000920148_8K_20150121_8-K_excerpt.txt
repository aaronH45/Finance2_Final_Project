The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt. A copy of the press release is being furnished with this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.  

LabCorp intends to use the net proceeds of the Notes offering to pay a portion of the cash consideration and the fees and expenses in connection with its pending acquisition of Covance Inc.
