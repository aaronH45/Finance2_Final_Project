      NEWS RELEASE 

For the year, net cash flows from operating activities were approximately $889 million, an increase of $191 million compared with approximately $698 million in 2013. The increase was primarily driven by reductions in working capital, partially offset by lower net income. Cash flows used for investing activities were approximately $709 million, an increase of $467 million, compared to approximately $242 million in 2013, driven primarily by the acquisition of MEGA Brands. Cash flows used for financing activities and other were approximately $248 million, a decrease of $504 million, compared with approximately $752 million in 2013. The change was primarily due to lower repayments of long-term debt and lower share repurchases, partially offset by lower proceeds from stock option exercises. 

Capital Deployment  

The Board of Directors declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the first quarter of 2014. The dividend will be payable on March 6, 2015 to stockholders of record on February 19, 2015.  

For 2014, a portion of Mattel’s dividend will be classified as a non-dividend distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although Mattel has significant retained earnings, these earnings do not constitute “earnings and profits” as defined in U.S. Federal tax rules. Non-dividend distributions are considered a return of capital and are generally not taxable; however, the recipient must adjust their cost basis to reflect the distribution. For 2014, approximately 80% of the distribution is a non-dividend distribution. Please visit http://investor.shareholder.com/mattel/ for more information.  

In the fourth quarter 2014, the Company repurchased 1.6 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $49 million, and, for the year, the Company repurchased 4.9 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $177 million.
