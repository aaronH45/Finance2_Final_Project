At the Expiration Time, valid tenders had been received with respect to approximately $1,146.501 million of the $1,226.6 million aggregate principal amount of 7¾% Notes outstanding and approximately $305.866 million of the $377.01 million aggregate principal amount of the 7⅞% Notes outstanding (which excludes 7¾% Notes and 7⅞% Notes subject to the guaranteed delivery procedures, respectively).

On February 18, 2015, the issuers also completed their previously announced offering of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). Wynn Las Vegas, LLC used a portion of the net proceeds of the 2025 Notes offering to purchase the 2020 Notes tendered and accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC intends to satisfy and discharge the Indentures governing each of the 7¾% Notes and 7⅞% Notes and use the remaining net proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering to redeem the 7¾% Notes and 7⅞% Notes not tendered and for general corporate purposes.

The 2025 Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or under any state securities laws. Therefore, the issuers may not offer or sell the 2025 Notes within the United States to, or for the account or benefit of, any United States person unless the offer or sale would qualify for a registration exemption from the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the 2025 Notes described in this press release, nor shall there be any sale of the 2025 Notes in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
