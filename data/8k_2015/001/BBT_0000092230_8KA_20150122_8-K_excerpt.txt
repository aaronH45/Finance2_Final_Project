Explanatory Note 

This Form 8-K/A is filed as an amendment (“Amendment No. 1”) to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by BB&T Corporation on January 22, 2015 under Items 2.02 and 9.01 (the “Original 8-K”). Amendment No. 1 is being filed solely to correct a typographical error in the fourth quarter 2014 Earnings Release, which was furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to the Original 8-K (the “Original Earnings Release”). The Original Earnings Release included a quotation which erroneously stated that BB&T sold approximately $140 million of residential mortgage loans at an after-tax gain of $24 million, however, the $24 million gain was actually a pre-tax item. A corrected version of the Earnings Release is included herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is being posted on BB&T Corporation’s website. 

There are no additional changes to the Original Earnings Release, the Original 8-K or the exhibits thereto.

On January 22, 2015, BB&T Corporation issued a press release reporting fourth quarter 2014 results and posted on its website its fourth quarter 2014 Earnings Release, Quarterly Performance Summary and Earnings Release Presentation. The release contains forward-looking statements regarding BB&T and includes a cautionary statement identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. The Earnings Release, Quarterly Performance Summary and Earnings Release Presentation are furnished as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3, respectively.
