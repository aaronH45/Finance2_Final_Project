(WARSAW, IN) January 29, 2015—Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and SIX: ZMH) today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. The Company reported fourth quarter net sales of $1.22 billion, a decrease of 1.4% reported and an increase of 2.4% constant currency over the fourth quarter of 2013. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.91 reported and $1.71 adjusted, an increase of 3.0% adjusted over the prior year period. Full year net sales were $4.67 billion, an increase of 1.1% reported and 2.4% constant currency over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the year were $4.19 reported and $6.06 adjusted, an increase of 5.4% adjusted over the prior year.  

“In the fourth quarter, Zimmer delivered solid growth across several of our product categories, with impressive contributions from our Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa sales regions,” said David Dvorak, President and CEO of Zimmer. “Our commitments to innovation and focused execution have positioned Zimmer to act on the transformational opportunity to combine with Biomet. The combined entity will offer a more comprehensive and diversified musculoskeletal portfolio for our customers, as well as create operational synergies that will enhance value for our stockholders. We look forward to the expected closing of this transaction later this quarter.”  

Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $156.6 million on a reported basis and $295.6 million on an adjusted basis, an increase of 2.4% adjusted over the prior year period. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $354.2 million.  

During the quarter, the Company paid $37.2 million in dividends and declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.22 per share, an increase of 10.0% over the prior year period.

Guidance  

The Company expects revenues for the first quarter of 2015 to increase between 1.5% and 2.5% on a billing day and constant currency basis over the prior year period. The Company estimates that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 6.0% for the first quarter of 2015. First quarter 2015 diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $1.12 to $1.14 on a reported basis and $1.58 to $1.60 on an adjusted cash basis. This adjusted range reflects estimated charges for amortization, inventory and manufacturing related expenses, quality and operational excellence initiatives, expenses related to the pending Biomet merger and special items of $107.0 million on a pre-tax basis, or approximately $0.46 per diluted share, on an after-tax basis in the first quarter of 2015. This guidance does not contemplate the projected accretion associated with the pending Biomet merger. Guidance for the full year 2015 will be provided after the closing of the transaction with Biomet, expected before the end of this quarter.
