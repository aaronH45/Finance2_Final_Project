 Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement  

On November 19, 2010, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (the “Company”) entered into an Indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Indenture”). On January 30, 2015, the Company entered into supplemental indentures to the Indenture under which the Company issued $2.9 billion in debt securities, consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”), $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.200% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”), $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.600% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.700% Senior Notes due 2045 (the “2045 Notes,” and collectively with the 2020 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the “Notes”). The 2020 Notes were issued pursuant to the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 30, 2015, under the Indenture (the “2020 Notes Supplemental Indenture”), the 2022 Notes were issued pursuant to the Eighth Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 30, 2015, under the Indenture (the “2022 Notes Supplemental Indenture”), the 2025 Notes were issued pursuant to the Ninth Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 30, 2015, under the Indenture (the “2025 Notes Supplemental Indenture”) and the 2045 Notes were issued pursuant to the Tenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 30, 2015, under the Indenture (the “2045 Notes Supplemental Indenture, and collectively with the 2020 Notes Supplemental Indenture, the 2022 Notes Supplemental Indenture and the 2025 Notes Supplemental Indenture, the “Supplemental Indentures”).  

The Notes were issued in a public offering pursuant to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200740) and the base prospectus included in that registration statement as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement dated January 21, 2015, as filed January 22, 2015 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the base prospectus, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, the “Prospectus”). The terms of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures, and the Notes are described in the section of the Prospectus entitled Debt Securities, as supplemented by the section entitled Description of the Notes, and those sections of the Prospectus are incorporated in this Form 8-K by reference.  

The Company expects that the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be approximately $2,868.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated expenses of the offering.
