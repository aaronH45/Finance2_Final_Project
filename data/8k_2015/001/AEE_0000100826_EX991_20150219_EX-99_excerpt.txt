EXPLANATORY NOTE: Ameren Missouri sent the following cover note and attachment to Missouri Public Service Commission staff and intervenors on February 15, 2015:  

Although we appreciate all parties’ efforts to work on and discuss the possibility of a global settlement, given the counter-offer we received on Friday it does not appear to us that further discussions about a global settlement would be productive. Since the hearings in our case begin in just over a week, we have turned our attention to partial settlements in order to resolve some of the less material issues, and clean up the case so that the major issues can be presented to the Commission in an orderly manner. To that end I am attaching a proposed partial settlement offer that would resolve 16 of the smaller revenue requirement issues and establish base amounts for the trackers that are not at issue in the case. The document also memorializes a number of revenue requirement items which we believe have been resolved. In addition to this proposed partial settlement, we are also working with the parties with positions on fuel issues to develop a separate settlement which we believe can address most or all of those issues. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow morning.

EXPLANATORY NOTE: Ameren Missouri sent the following cover note and attachment to Missouri Public Service Commission staff and intervenors on February 17, 2015:  

After discussing this settlement at length with our senior management last night, I am authorized to offer $12 million to settle the package of issues, with coal-in-transit and vegetation management/infrastructure inspection trackers and their bases pulled out for us to litigate. See the attached mark-up of the offer we received. We are generally in agreement with the non-revenue requirement proposals, and [Redacted] and his staff are double checking the list of additional items settled, as well as [Redacted]’s list of items and dollar amounts that she sent separately. I don’t believe there is much if anything more we can offer for these issues, but we would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
