The Procter & Gamble Company: Reg G Reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures 

In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in Procter & Gamble's February 19, 2015 CAGNY Conference presentation and associated slides with the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. The measures provided are as follows:  

  1.   Organic Sales Growth—page 1     

  2.   Core EPS and Currency-neutral Core EPS—page 2     

  3.   Core Operating Profit Margin—page 3     

  4.   Core Gross Margin—page 3     

  5.   Adjusted Free Cash Flow—page 4     

  6.   Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity—page 4     

1. Organic Sales Growth: 

Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales is as follows: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

*Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes volume and mix impacts of acquired and divested businesses, as well as rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.  

2. Core EPS and Currency-Neutral Core EPS: Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding current year and prior year charges related to incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings and current year charges for European legal matters and remeasuring certain Venezuela balance sheet items. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. 

Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We believe the currency-neutral Core EPS measure provides a more comparable view of year-on-year earnings per share growth. 

The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS and Core EPS to Currency-neutral Core EPS:

3. Core Operating Profit Margin: This is a measure of the Company's Operating Margin adjusted for charges in both years for incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings and current year charges for European legal matters and remeasuring certain Venezuela balance sheet items:

4. Core Gross Margin: This is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for charges in both years for incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

5. Adjusted Free Cash Flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending excluding tax payments for certain significant divestitures. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. The reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow is provided below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

6. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges and certain significant divestiture gains. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual free cash flow at or above 90 percent of net earnings. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is also a measure used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity is provided below:
