FISCAL YEAR 2015 OUTLOOK

In 2015, Nordstrom plans to continue to invest and build upon its foundation for achieving sustainable growth in sales, earnings and ROIC. The outlook incorporates the impact of the following growth initiatives:

•The Company expects its ongoing expansion into Canada to continue to be dilutive to earnings due to infrastructure and pre-opening costs. The estimated loss before interest and taxes for Canada is expected to be approximately $60 million in fiscal 2015, compared with a loss before interest and taxes of $32 million in fiscal 2014.

•The Company estimates $30 million in expenses associated with initiatives to enable growth, including an additional fulfillment center and an expansion of the Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program, both planned in the second half of 2015.

•The Company expects an estimated loss before interest and taxes of approximately $30 million related to Trunk Club, compared with a loss before interest and taxes of approximately $25 million in fiscal 2014. 

The Company's expectations for fiscal 2015 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 The Company's outlook also incorporates the following assumptions:

•Credit card revenue is expected to increase approximately 5 percent due to volume growth.

•Due to the ongoing growth initiatives, depreciation and amortization expense is expected to increase by approximately 15 percent and rent expense is expected to increase by approximately 35 percent.

•Interest expense is expected to be consistent with fiscal 2014.

•The effective tax rate is expected to be in-line with historical rates.

•Earnings per diluted share growth in the first half of fiscal 2015 is expected to be below the full-year outlook range of a 2 percent decrease and 2 percent increase, primarily due to store pre-opening expenses and the full year impact of the Trunk Club acquisition.

RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)

(unaudited; dollar and share amounts in millions)

We believe ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and believe ROIC is an important component of shareholders' return over the long term. In addition, we incorporate ROIC in our executive incentive compensation measures. For the 12 fiscal months ended January 31, 2015, our ROIC decreased to 12.6% compared with 13.6% for the 12 fiscal months ended February 1, 2014. This decrease reflected the acquisition of Trunk Club in addition to ongoing store expansion and increased technology investments.

ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, return on assets, net earnings, total assets or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to ROIC is return on assets. The following is a reconciliation of the components of ROIC and return on assets:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Capitalized operating leases is our best estimate of the asset base we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease, or we had purchased the property. Asset base is calculated as described in footnote 5 below.

2 Based upon our effective tax rate multiplied by the net operating profit for the 12 fiscal months ended January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014.

3 Based upon the trailing 12-month average.

4 Based upon the trailing 12-month average for accounts payable, accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, and other current liabilities.

5 Based upon the trailing 12-month average of the monthly asset base. The asset base for each month is calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the asset base we would record for our capitalized operating leases described in footnote 1.

ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)

(unaudited; amounts in millions)

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is one of our key financial metrics, and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment-grade credit rating and operate with an efficient capital structure. In evaluating our debt levels, this measure provides a reflection of our credit worthiness that could impact our credit rating and borrowing costs. We also have a debt covenant that requires an adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio of less than four times. As of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR was 2.1.

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, debt to net earnings, net earnings, debt or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is debt to net earnings. The following is a reconciliation of the components of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR and debt to net earnings:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The components of Adjusted Debt are as of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, while the components of EBITDAR are for the 12 months ended January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014.

2 Based upon the estimated lease liability as of the end of the period, calculated as the trailing 12-months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the debt we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease, or we had purchased the property.

FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)

(unaudited; amounts in millions)

Free Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures, and when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, provides investors with a meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash from our business. For the year ended January 31, 2015, Free Cash Flow decreased to $96 compared with $324 for the year ended February 1, 2014.

Free Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:
