"We are pleased to report strong 2014 results that reflect significant progress in the marketplace and exceeded our growth and margin targets. The competitiveness of our agencies, digital capabilities and offerings in key growth markets — combined with our ability to deliver custom integrated solutions to our clients — is evident in the group's continued strong organic growth and positive new business momentum," said Michael I. Roth, Interpublic's Chairman and CEO. "Equally important is the 120 basis points improvement in operating margin that we delivered. This is an area on which we remain closely focused, and represents significant opportunity as we drive toward our goal of fully-competitive 13% operating margins. Going forward, we will continue to invest in talent and behind the growth sectors of our industry, so as to further enhance our portfolio of offerings, which is highly relevant in today's 

dynamic and complex consumer media landscape. We also remain committed to our robust capital return programs, as evident in the actions our Board has taken today to increase the dividend and authorization for share repurchase. These will continue to be drivers of value creation. Looking to 2015, we believe the tone of the business is solid, yet there remains macro uncertainty relating to both the currency environment and Europe. For 2015, we are therefore targeting 3 - 4% organic revenue growth, and 80 - 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. Coupled with strong capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on our strong track record of enhancing shareholder value."
