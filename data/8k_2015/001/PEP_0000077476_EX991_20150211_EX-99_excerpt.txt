Summary of Fourth Quarter Financial Performance:

•Organic revenue grew 5 percent and reported net revenue declined 1 percent. Foreign exchange translation had a 6-percentage-point unfavorable impact on reported net revenue.

•Developing and emerging market organic revenue grew 10 percent. On a reported basis, developing and emerging market net revenue declined 4 percent, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange translation, in particular, significant currency volatility in the Russian ruble and Venezuelan bolivar. 

•During the fourth quarter, we remeasured certain net monetary assets of our Venezuelan entities at the SICAD I auction-based rate of 12 bolivars per U.S. dollar versus the fixed exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar resulting in a $0.07 per share after-tax net charge reflected in our reported results1. In addition, this change in exchange rate had an unfavorable impact on our core operating results. 

•Core gross margin and core operating margin expanded 70 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively, reflecting the implementation of effective revenue management strategies and productivity initiatives. Reported gross margin increased 60 basis points while reported operating margin decreased 175 basis points.

•Core constant currency operating profit increased 7 percent. Results in the current year quarter reflect charges associated with efficiency initiatives, substantially offset by incremental investments in the prior year quarter. Reported operating profit decreased 15 percent and included the impact of restructuring and impairment charges, remeasurement of certain net monetary assets of our Venezuelan entities, a pension lump sum settlement charge and mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges.

•The company’s core effective tax rate was 25.5 percent, which compares to 28.2 percent in the prior-year quarter. The reported effective tax rate was 25.6 percent, above the prior-year quarter of 19 percent. 

•Core EPS was $1.12 and reported EPS was $0.87. Core EPS excludes a negative net impact of $0.08 per share from restructuring and impairment charges, $0.07 per share related to the remeasurement of certain net monetary assets of our Venezuelan entities, $0.06 per share related to a pension lump sum settlement charge and $0.04 per share related to mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges. Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity hedges are subsequently reflected in core division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. 

1 Significant uncertainty exists regarding the exchange mechanisms in Venezuela. In February 2015, the Venezuelan government indicated it would implement further changes to the three existing exchange mechanisms. Any further devaluation of the bolivar or change in the exchange mechanisms could adversely affect our financial results, including resulting in further charges or impairment of our non-monetary assets or a higher than expected unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. See page A-17 for additional information.

Summary of Full Year 2014 Financial Performance:

•Organic revenue grew 4 percent and reported net revenue was even. Foreign exchange translation had over a 3-percentage-point unfavorable impact on reported net revenue.

•Developing and emerging market organic revenue grew 9 percent. On a reported basis, developing and emerging market net revenue declined 1 percent, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange translation, in particular, significant currency volatility in the Russian ruble and Venezuelan bolivar.

•Core gross margin increased 55 basis points and core operating margin increased 30 basis points. Reported gross margin increased 75 basis points and reported operating margin decreased 25 basis points.

•Core constant currency operating profit increased 5 percent. Reported operating profit decreased 1 percent and included the impact of restructuring and impairment charges, remeasurement of certain net monetary assets of our Venezuelan entities, a pension lump sum settlement charge and mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges.

•The company’s core effective tax rate was 25 percent, which compares to 25.7 percent in the prior year. The reported effective tax rate was 25.1 percent, above the prior year of 23.7 percent. 

•Core EPS was $4.63 and reported EPS was $4.27. Core EPS excludes a negative net impact of $0.21 per share from restructuring and impairment charges, $0.07 per share related to the remeasurement of certain net monetary assets of our Venezuelan entities, $0.06 per share related to a pension lump sum settlement charge and $0.03 per share related to mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges. 

•Delivered $1 billion of productivity savings in 2014.

•Cash flow provided by operating activities was $10.5 billion for the year. Free cash flow (excluding certain items) was $8.3 billion for the year.

•Core net return on invested capital was 17.5 percent for the year, an increase of 110 basis points from the prior year. Reported net return on invested capital was 13.2 percent for the year, a decrease of 80 basis points from the prior year. 

•The company returned a total of $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014 through $3.7 billion in dividends and $5.0 billion in share repurchases.

•Low-single-digit commodity inflation, which includes the estimated impact of transaction-related foreign exchange;

•Productivity savings of approximately $1 billion;

•Higher interest expense driven by increased debt balances; and

•A core effective tax rate of approximately 25 percent.

Miscellaneous Disclosures

In discussing financial results and guidance, the company may refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of any such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP can be found in the attached exhibits, as well as on the company’s website at www.pepsico.com in the “Investors” section under “Events & Presentations.” Our non-GAAP measures exclude from reported results those items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflect how management evaluates our operating results and trends.

Glossary

Acquisitions and divestitures: All merger and acquisition activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.

Beverage volume: Volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our bottlers.

Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.

Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. In 2014, core results exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, a pension lump sum settlement charge and a charge related to the 2014 Venezuela remeasurement. In 2013, core results exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, merger and integration charges in connection with our acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods OJSC (WBD), restructuring and impairment charges, a charge related to the 2013 Venezuela currency devaluation and a tax benefit. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” for additional information.

Division operating profit: The aggregation of the operating profit for each of our reportable segments, which excludes the impact of corporate unallocated expenses.

Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.

Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending plus sales of property, plant and equipment. See above for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP (operating cash flow).

Free cash flow, excluding certain items: Free cash flow, excluding: (1) discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions, (2) payments related to restructuring charges, (3) net capital investments related to restructuring plan and (4) the tax impacts associated with each of these items, as applicable. This non-GAAP financial measure is our primary measure used to monitor cash flow performance. See above for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP (operating cash flow). See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” for additional information.

Mark-to-market gain or loss or net impact: Change in market value for commodity contracts that we purchase to mitigate the volatility in costs of energy and raw materials that we consume. The market value is determined based on average prices on national exchanges and recently reported transactions in the marketplace.

Net capital spending: Capital spending less cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.

Organic: A measure that adjusts for impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, and in the case of organic revenue, foreign exchange translation. In excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, we assume constant foreign exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. See the definition of “Constant currency” for additional information.

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information (unaudited)

Division operating profit, core results, core constant currency results and organic results are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain items noted below. These measures are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). However, we believe investors should consider these measures as they are more indicative of our ongoing performance and reflect how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP reporting measures.

Commodity mark-to-market net impact

In the quarter and year ended December 27, 2014, we recognized mark-to-market net losses of $100 million and $68 million, respectively, on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. In the quarter and year ended December 28, 2013, we recognized $2 million of mark-to-market net gains and $72 million of mark-to-market net losses, respectively, on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses, as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.

Merger and integration charges

In the quarter and year ended December 28, 2013, we incurred merger and integration charges of $1 million and $10 million, respectively, related to our acquisition of WBD, all of which were recorded in the Europe segment. 

Restructuring and impairment charges

2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan

In the quarter and year ended December 27, 2014, we incurred restructuring charges of $130 million and $357 million, respectively, in conjunction with the multi-year productivity plan we publicly announced on February 13, 2014 (2014 Productivity Plan). In the quarter and year ended December 28, 2013, we incurred restructuring charges of $53 million in conjunction with our 2014 Productivity Plan. The 2014 Productivity Plan includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our food, snack and beverage businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing 

 A - 16

automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency.

2012 Multi-Year Productivity Plan

In the quarter and year ended December 27, 2014, we incurred restructuring charges of $30 million and $61 million, respectively, in conjunction with the multi-year productivity plan we publicly announced on February 9, 2012 (2012 Productivity Plan). In the quarter and year ended December 28, 2013, we incurred restructuring charges of $73 million and $110 million, respectively, in conjunction with our 2012 Productivity Plan. The 2012 Productivity Plan includes actions in every aspect of our business that we believe will strengthen our complementary food, snack and beverage businesses by: leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo’s operations, go-to-market and information systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing, warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures, with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management.

In the quarter and year ended December 27, 2014, we recorded a pension lump sum settlement charge of $141 million related to payments for pension liabilities to certain former employees who had vested benefits.

Venezuela remeasurement charges

In the quarter and year ended December 27, 2014, we recorded a $105 million net charge related to our remeasurement of the bolivar for certain net monetary assets of our Venezuela businesses. $126 million of this charge was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses, with the balance (equity income of $21 million) recorded in our PAB segment. 

In 2014, our results of operations in Venezuela generated 2% of our net revenue and 4% of our operating profit. As of December 27, 2014, our operations in Venezuela comprised 9% of our cash and cash equivalents balance. Our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets in Venezuela, which primarily include cash and cash equivalents, approximated $480 million at December 27, 2014. Our non-monetary assets in Venezuela, which primarily include equity investments, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and inventory, approximated $650 million at December 27, 2014. As of December 27, 2014, there were three exchange mechanisms in Venezuela (the fixed exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar; the SICAD 1 auction-based exchange rate which as of December 27, 2014 was 12 bolivars per U.S. dollar; and the SICAD 2 auction-based exchange rate which as of December 27, 2014 was 50 bolivars per U.S dollar). In February 2015, the Venezuelan government indicated it would implement further changes to these three existing exchange mechanisms. We continue to monitor developments closely and may determine in the future that rates other than the SICAD 1 rate or the fixed exchange rate, as applicable, are appropriate for remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan entities. If, at December 27, 2014, we had used the SICAD 1 rate to remeasure the net monetary assets that remain at the fixed exchange rate, we would have incurred an additional net charge of approximately $160 million. If, at December 27, 2014, we had remeasured all net monetary assets of our Venezuela businesses at the SICAD 2 rate, we would have incurred an additional net charge of approximately $400 million. Any further devaluation of the bolivar or change in the currency exchange mechanisms could adversely affect our financial results, including resulting in further charges or impairment of our non-monetary assets or a higher than expected unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. 

In the year ended December 28, 2013, we recorded a $111 million net charge related to the devaluation of the bolivar for our Venezuela businesses. $124 million of this charge was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses, with the balance (equity income of $13 million) recorded in our PAB segment. 

Tax benefit

In the quarter and year ended December 28, 2013, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $209 million associated with our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2003 through 2009, which reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions for the tax years 2003 through 2012. 

Free cash flow, excluding certain items

Free cash flow (excluding the items noted in the Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Reconciliation table) is the primary measure management uses to monitor cash flow performance. This is not a measure defined by GAAP. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Additionally, we consider certain other items (included in the Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Reconciliation table) in evaluating free cash flow that we believe investors should consider in evaluating our free cash flow results.

2015 guidance and long-term targets

Our 2015 core tax rate guidance, our 2015 core constant currency EPS growth guidance and our long-term core constant currency EPS growth target exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses and restructuring and impairment charges. Our 2015 organic revenue growth guidance and our long-term organic revenue growth target exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. In addition, our 2015 organic revenue growth guidance, our 2015 core constant currency EPS growth guidance, our long-term organic revenue growth target and our long-term core constant currency EPS growth target exclude the impact of foreign exchange. We are not able to reconcile our full year projected 2015 core tax rate to our full year projected 2015 reported tax rate, our full year projected 2015 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2015 reported EPS growth or our long-term projected core constant currency EPS growth to our long-term projected reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2015 and long-term impacts of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity hedges due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. We are also unable to reconcile our full year projected 2015 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2015 reported net revenue growth or our long-term projected organic revenue growth to our long-term projected reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2015 and long-term impacts of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
