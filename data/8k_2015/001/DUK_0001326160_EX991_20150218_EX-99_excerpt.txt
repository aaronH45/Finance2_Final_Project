Duke Energy reports 2014 adjusted EPS within guidance range and announces 2015 adjusted EPS guidance range  

   •   Company achieves adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.55 in 2014, compared to $4.36 in 2013; reported diluted EPS of $2.66 for 2014, compared to $3.76 in 2013  

   •   Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of 86 cents, compared to $1.00 for the fourth quarter 2013; fourth quarter 2014 reported diluted EPS of 14 cents, compared to 97 cents in 2013  

   •   Company establishes 2015 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 and extends its longer-term 4 to 6 percent average annual growth objective in adjusted diluted EPS through 2017  

   •   After completing a strategic review of International Energy, the company plans to continue to own and operate the business and has developed a plan to access $2.7 billion in undistributed foreign earnings in a tax efficient manner  

   •   Company in settlement discussions with U.S. government to close the federal grand jury investigation of Duke Energy related to the Dan River spill  

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy today announced 2014 full-year adjusted diluted EPS of $4.55, within its adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.65. Adjusted diluted EPS for 2013 was $4.36. Duke Energy’s full-year 2014 reported diluted EPS was $2.66, compared to $3.76 in 2013.  

Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted diluted EPS was 86 cents, compared to $1.00 for fourth quarter 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 reported diluted EPS was 14 cents, compared to 97 cents for fourth quarter 2013.  

On an adjusted EPS basis during the quarter, Regulated Utilities results were impacted by higher operations and maintenance expenses primarily related to nuclear outage cost levelization in the Carolinas, as well as timing of fossil plant outages. In the non-regulated businesses, higher PJM capacity revenues for the Midwest Generation fleet  

 Duke Energy News Release   2  

 and increased results from the renewables business were offset by lower earnings at International Energy resulting from the widespread drought in Brazil.  

The company has completed a strategic review of its International Energy business. As a result, Duke Energy will continue to own, operate and create value with the business. Additionally, a plan has been developed giving the company access to $2.7 billion in foreign earnings through 2022. Reported results for the quarter include a $373 million, or $0.53 per share, tax charge resulting from this plan. This charge has been excluded from the company’s adjusted diluted EPS results for 2014.  

Additionally, the company is in settlement discussions with the U.S. government related to the ongoing federal grand jury investigation of the February 2014 Dan River coal ash spill and ash basin operations at other North Carolina coal plants. The company expects a proposed agreement could be reached and filed in the next several days for consideration by the court. If approved, the proposed agreement would resolve the ongoing grand jury investigation of the company’s coal ash basin management. Reported results for the fourth quarter 2014 include a charge of approximately $100 million, or $0.14 per share, related to the company’s assessment of probable financial exposure related to any agreement. This charge has been excluded from the company’s adjusted diluted EPS results for 2014.  

“2014 was a year of great accomplishment and challenge,” said President and CEO Lynn Good. “Our system reliably met record customer demands during the 2014 polar vortex. Our teams quickly and safely responded to over 1.7 million customer outages following two major ice storms early in the year.  

“We achieved our financial targets for the year and built a platform of growth initiatives to position the company for the future,” Good stated. “We completed the strategic review of our international businesses and entered into an agreement to sell our Midwest commercial generation business. We also strengthened our coal ash management practices in response to the Dan River coal ash incident.  

“We believe we are close to an agreement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the U.S. government’s ongoing grand jury investigation into the February 2014 Dan River coal ash spill and ash basin operations at other North Carolina coal plants,” added Good.  

The company has set its 2015 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range at $4.55 to $4.75 and updated through 2017 its longer-term 4 to 6 percent average annual growth in adjusted diluted EPS based upon the midpoint of the original 2013 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.20 to $4.45.

Business unit results  

In addition to the summary business unit discussion below, a comprehensive table of quarterly and year-to-date adjusted earnings per share drivers compared to the prior year are provided on pages 17 and 18.  

The discussion below of fourth-quarter results includes adjusted segment income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tables on pages 26 through 29 present a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results.  

Regulated Utilities  

Regulated Utilities recognized fourth quarter 2014 adjusted segment income of $551 million, compared to $607 million in the fourth quarter 2013, a decrease of 8 cents per share. These results were driven by higher operations and maintenance expense (-$0.10 per share) primarily due to nuclear outage cost levelization and the timing of fossil plant outages.  

Full-year 2014 adjusted segment income for Regulated Utilities was $2,897 million, compared to $2,776 million in 2013, an increase of $0.17 per share.  

Increased year-to-date results at Regulated Utilities were primarily driven by:  

   •   Favorable weather (+$0.20 per share) across Duke Energy’s service territories  

   •   Higher revenues from increased pricing and riders primarily related to the implementation of revised customer rates, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense (+$0.08 per share)  

These favorable drivers were partially offset by:  

   •   Higher operations and maintenance expense (-$0.10 per share) primarily due to higher storm restoration costs, the timing of fossil plant outages and nuclear outage cost levelization; partially offset by lower employee benefit costs  

International Energy  

International Energy recognized fourth quarter 2014 adjusted segment income of $72 million, compared to $108 million in the fourth quarter 2013, a decrease of $0.05 per share. These results were driven by unfavorable results in Latin America (-$0.06 per share) primarily due to lower volumes and higher purchased power costs resulting from poor hydrology in Brazil.  

Full-year 2014 adjusted segment income for International Energy was $428 million, compared to $408 million in 2013, an increase of $0.03 per share.  

International Energy’s improved year-to-date adjusted earnings were driven by:  

 Duke Energy News Release   4  

   •   Stronger results in Latin America (+$0.03 per share) primarily due to a tax benefit resulting from the reorganization of the company’s operations in Chile, offset by lower volumes and higher purchased power costs resulting from poor hydrology in Brazil  

   •   Higher results at National Methanol Company (+$0.01 per share) due to a prior-year extended planned maintenance outage  

These favorable drivers were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates (-$0.03 per share)  

Commercial Power  

Commercial Power recognized fourth quarter 2014 adjusted segment income of $32 million, compared to a $3 million adjusted segment loss in the fourth quarter 2013, an increase of $0.05 per share.  

Commercial Power’s improved quarterly adjusted earnings were primarily driven by:  

   •   Higher results from the Midwest coal and gas generation fleets (+$0.02 per share) primarily due to higher PJM capacity prices, partially offset by increased outage costs  

   •   Increased results from the renewables business (+$0.02 per share) due to lower costs and additional renewable investments  

Full-year 2014 adjusted segment income for Commercial Power was $109 million, compared to $15 million in 2013, an increase of $0.14 per share.  

Commercial Power’s improved year-to-date adjusted earnings were primarily driven by:  

   •   Higher results from the Midwest coal and gas generation fleets (+$0.10 per share) primarily due to higher PJM capacity prices, partially offset by lower coal margins  

   •   Increased results from the renewables business (+$0.06 per share) due to higher production of the wind and solar portfolio, lower costs, and additional renewable investments  

These results were partially offset by lower earnings from Duke Energy Retail (-$0.03 per share).  

Other  

On an adjusted basis, Other primarily includes corporate interest expense not allocated to the business units, results from Duke Energy’s captive insurance company, other investments, and quarterly income tax levelization adjustments.  

 Duke Energy News Release   5  

Other recognized a fourth quarter 2014 adjusted net expense of $45 million, compared to net expense of $5 million in the fourth quarter 2013. The $0.06 per share decrease was primarily driven by income tax levelization adjustments.  

Full-year 2014 adjusted net expense for Other was $216 million, compared to $119 million for 2013. The $0.15 per share decrease was primarily driven by higher income taxes, including a prior-year state tax benefit.  

On a consolidated basis, the company experienced a fourth-quarter 2014 adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 30 percent, compared to approximately 31 percent in the prior year. The company experienced an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 32 percent for full-year 2014, compared to approximately 33 percent in 2013. Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tables on pages 30 and 31 present a reconciliation of reported effective tax rate to adjusted effective tax rate.  

2014 accounting matters  

Midwest generation sale  

Following the announcement of the sale of the nonregulated Midwest generation business to Dynegy in the third quarter 2014, this business was reclassified as discontinued operations for accounting purposes. Despite this accounting designation, financial results from this business will remain in Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted segment income until the close of the transaction.  

International tax charge  

International Energy has declared a taxable dividend of its historical undistributed foreign earnings in the form of a note distribution of $2.7 billion, providing Duke Energy the ability to repatriate up to $2.7 billion of cash from the International operations to the United States in a tax efficient manner. Duke Energy is required to accrue U.S. income taxes on this dividend declaration. U.S. taxes are computed based upon the 35 percent U.S. federal tax rate offset by any applicable foreign tax credits. As a result of the decision to repatriate historical foreign earnings, Duke Energy recognized a $373 million tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2014. This charge is excluded from the company’s adjusted diluted earnings per share results for 2014.  

U.S. government grand jury investigation  

The company is in settlement discussions with the U.S. government related to the ongoing federal grand jury investigation of the February 2014 Dan River coal ash spill and ash basin operations at other North Carolina coal plants. Reported results for the fourth quarter 2014 include a charge of approximately $100 million, or 14 cents per share, related to the company’s assessment of probable financial exposure related to any agreement. This charge is excluded from the company’s adjusted diluted EPS results for 2014.

Non-GAAP financial measures  

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on the non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). These items are measured as income from continuing operations net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted for dollar and per share impact of mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment and special items including the operating results of the nonregulated Midwest generation business (Disposal Group) classified as discontinued operations for GAAP purposes. Special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis, although it is reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur. As result of the agreement in August of 2014 to sell the Disposal Group to Dynegy, the operating results of the Disposal Group are classified as discontinued operations, including a portion of the mark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative contracts. Management believes that including the operating results of the Disposal Group classified as discontinued operations better reflects its financial performance and therefore has included these results in adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS. Derivative contracts are used in Duke Energy’s hedging of a portion of the economic value of its generation assets in the Commercial Power segment. The mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts is recognized in GAAP earnings immediately and, if associated with the Disposal Group, classified as discontinued operations, as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. The economic value of generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of input and output commodities (e.g. coal, electricity, natural gas). Economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to generation assets. Operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method. Management believes excluding impacts of mark-to-market changes of the derivative contracts from adjusted earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the derivative contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the Board of Directors, employees, shareholders, analysts and investors concerning Duke Energy’s financial performance. Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation and Diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common shareholders, which include the dollar and per share impact of special items, mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment and discontinued operations.  

Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany  

 Duke Energy News Release   9  

 revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management also uses adjusted segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment performance. Adjusted segment income is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it is based upon segment income adjusted for the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment and special items, including the operating results of the Disposal Group classified as discontinued operations for GAAP purposes. Management believes the presentation of adjusted segment income as presented provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment’s performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment income is segment income, which represents segment income from continuing operations, including any special items and the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment.  

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted earnings guidance, information to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to project all special items or mark-to-market adjustments for future periods. The earnings guidance range assumptions for 2015 include a half-year of earnings contributions from the nonregulated Midwest generation business, which management has entered into an agreement to sell. Irrespective of discontinued operations accounting treatment, operating results from the nonregulated Midwest generation business will be included in Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted segment income until the close of the transaction.  

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted segment income or adjusted Other net expenses and any related growth rates for future periods, information to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not available at this time, as the company is unable to forecast all special items, the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment, or any amounts that may be reported as discontinued operations or extraordinary items for future periods.

 (a) Primarily due to the September 2013 implementation of revised base rates for Duke Energy Carolinas (+$0.20), the implementation of the year one and year two step-up from the 2013 rate case for Duke Energy Progress (+$0.08), the January 1, 2014 implementation of revised base rates for Duke Energy Florida (+$0.04), and the May 2013 implementation of revised electric distribution rates for Duke Energy Ohio (+$0.02).  

 (b) Primarily due to higher storm costs (-$0.06), the timing of fossil plant outages (-$0.06) and lower benefit from the prior-year adoption of nuclear outage cost levelization (-$0.05), partially offset by favorable employee benefit costs (+$0.06).  

 (c) Primarily due to higher PJM capacity revenues (+$0.12), partially offset by lower coal generation margins (-$0.05) and lower results at Duke Energy Retail (-$0.03).  

 (d) Primarily due to higher production of the wind and solar portfolio, lower operating costs and additional renewables investments.  

 (e) Amount for Regulated Utilities is primarily due to the discontinuation of booking a post in-service debt return on projects that are now reflected in customer rates.  

 (f) Amount for Regulated Utilities includes an increase in depreciation and amortization expense (-$0.23) due to higher depreciable base and the prior-year reduction in the cost of removal component of amortization expense for Duke Energy Florida, higher non-income taxes (-$0.09) and lower AFUDC-equity (-$0.03), partially offset by increased wholesale net margins, including new contracts (+$0.06).  

 (g) Amount for International Energy is primarily due to higher interest income related to a prior-year leveraged distribution.  

 (h) Amount for Commercial Power is primarily due to prior-year litigation costs (+$0.01) and lower governance costs (+$0.01).  

 (i) Amount for Other is due to unfavorable captive insurance loss experience.

 * Mark-to-market adjustments reflect the impact of derivative contracts, which are used in Duke Energy’s hedging of a portion of the economic value of its generation assets in the Commercial Power segment and also relate to existing derivative positions that may have tenors beyond the planned disposal date of the nonregulated Midwest generation business. The mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts is recognized in GAAP earnings immediately as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. The economic value of generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of input and output commodities (e.g. coal, electricity, natural gas). Economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to generation assets. Operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method. Management believes excluding impacts of mark-to-market changes of the derivative contracts from adjusted earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the derivative contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset. However, due to the divestiture of the nonregulated Midwest generation business as mentioned above, certain derivative positions have tenors beyond the planned disposal date of these assets. As such, management has excluded settlements of these derivative positions from adjusted diluted EPS as these realized gains and losses more closely relate to the loss on disposal of these assets. Management believes that the presentation of adjusted diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy Corporation’s performance across periods.
