AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP REPORTS JANUARY TRAFFIC RESULTS  

FORT WORTH, Texas – American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) today reported January 2015 traffic results.  

American Airlines Group’s total revenue passenger miles (RPMs) for the month were 16.8 billion, down 2.8 percent versus January 2014. Total capacity was 21.5 billion available seat miles (ASMs), down 0.2 percent versus January 2014. Total passenger load factor was 78.2 percent for the month of January, down 2.1 percentage points versus January 2014.  

Based on one month of actual data and two months of forecast, the Company continues to expect its first quarter 2015 consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) to be down approximately two percent to four percent. Due to the recent rise in fuel prices, the Company is currently forecasting its first quarter fuel price to be approximately 10 cents higher than its previous guidance. The Company’s current estimate for first quarter fuel price is $1.81 to $1.86 per gallon versus its previous estimate of $1.71 to $1.76 per gallon. As a result, the Company now expects its first quarter pretax margin excluding special items to be approximately 12 percent to 14 percent versus its previous guidance of 13 percent to 15 percent.  

The following summarizes American Airlines Group traffic results for the month ended January 31, 2015 and 2014, consisting of mainline-operated flights, wholly owned regional subsidiaries and operating results from capacity purchase agreements.
