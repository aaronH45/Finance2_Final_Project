On a GAAP basis, the company reported EPS of $0.74 compared to $0.81 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income, and segment income exclude acquisition and redomicile-related expenses, restructuring costs, "mark-to-market" pension adjustment, impairments, gain on sale of businesses, and certain tax items.

Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted operating income was $274 million, up 10 percent compared to adjusted operating income for fourth quarter 2013, and adjusted operating margins were 15.2 percent, an expansion of 160 basis points when compared to adjusted 2013 operating margins. On a GAAP basis, the company reported operating income of $189 million for the quarter.

For the full year, the company reported sales of $7.0 billion, adjusted operating income of $1.0 billion, and adjusted EPS of $3.78. On a GAAP basis, the company reported operating income of $865 million and EPS of $3.18.

Pentair previously announced on December 10, 2014 that its Board of Directors approved a 16 percent increase in the company's regular annual cash dividend rate for 2015 to $1.28 from $1.10. 2015 will mark the 39th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its dividend.

“We ended 2014 with another strong quarter of robust margin expansion and earnings growth driven by strong internal execution,” said Randall J. Hogan, Pentair Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We delivered 2 percent core sales growth during the year despite some market headwinds that have strengthened, and we believe our diverse portfolio is positioned to deliver accelerating core sales growth in 2015."

OUTLOOK

The company updated its full year 2015 EPS outlook to a range of $4.10 - $4.25 from a range of $4.20 - $4.35 reflecting the anticipated unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. On an adjusted basis, this would represent an increase of 10 percent over 2014 adjusted EPS of $3.78. The company anticipates full year 2015 sales of $6.9 billion, or down approximately 2 percent on a reported basis and up 2 to 3 percent on a core sales basis. The company expects to generate free cash flow in excess of 115 percent of net income in 2015.

“While the stronger dollar has created additional foreign currency translation headwinds, our core business remains positioned to grow low single digits,” said Hogan. "Our cash flow remains strong and we remain committed to delivering more consistent, predictable growth while demonstrating our strong internal execution capabilities."

In addition, the company introduced first quarter 2015 EPS guidance of $0.75 - $0.77, up approximately 7 percent on an adjusted basis versus the same quarter last year's adjusted EPS. The company expects first quarter revenue to be approximately $1.6 billion, which would be down 2 to 3 percent on a reported basis and up 2 to 3 percent on a core basis compared to first quarter 2014 revenue.
