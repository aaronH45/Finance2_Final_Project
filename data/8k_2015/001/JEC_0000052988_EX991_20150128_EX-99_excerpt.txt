Jacobs also announced record total backlog of $19.1 billion at December 26, 2014, including a technical professional services component of $13.2 billion.

Commenting on the results for the first quarter, Jacobs Executive Chairman Noel Watson stated, “We were pleased with the first quarter results. Backlog is at record levels. First quarter sales were strong, and the prospect list for the rest of the year is good. Even so, the oil and commodity prices create a level of uncertainty for our industry, which leads us to be cautious in our outlook."
