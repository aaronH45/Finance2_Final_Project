Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

On February 19, 2015, SCANA Corporation (the Company) issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The press release discloses the following non-GAAP measures: (1) estimated 2015 GAAP-adjusted earnings per share, (2) average annual growth rate target for GAAP-adjusted earnings per share and (3) 2014 GAAP-adjusted weather normalized earnings per share. Each of these non-GAAP measures excludes the effects of abnormal weather in the electric business. In addition, the non-GAAP measure for estimated 2015 GAAP-adjusted earnings per share excludes the estimated earnings per share expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2015 from the sales of two subsidiaries. 

The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a meaningful representation of the Company's fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period-over-period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In management's opinion, these non-GAAP measures serve as useful indicators of the financial results of the Company's primary businesses and as a basis for management's provision of earnings guidance and growth projections. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the GAAP measures of earnings per share or average annual earnings per share growth rate, but are offered as supplements to those GAAP measures.
