Ameren Announces 2014 Results  

and Issues Earnings Guidance  

   •    2014 Diluted Earnings Per Share Were $2.40  

   •    2015 Diluted EPS Guidance Range Established at $2.45 to $2.65  

   •    Continue to Expect Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations to Grow at a 7% to 10% Compound Annual Rate from 2013 through 2018  

   •    Expect Rate Base to Grow at a 6% Compound Annual Rate from 2014 through 2019  

ST. LOUIS (Feb. 25, 2015) — Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2014 net income from continuing operations of $587 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, compared to 2013 net income from continuing operations of $512 million, or $2.10 per diluted share.  

The year-over-year increase in 2014 earnings from continuing operations reflected increased Illinois electric delivery and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-regulated electric transmission services earnings under formula ratemaking driven by infrastructure investments made to better serve customers. This increase in transmission service earnings was partially offset by a reserve for a potential reduction in the allowed return on equity (ROE). The improved earnings were also the result of increased rates for Illinois natural gas delivery service effective January 2014, decreased interest charges and the absence in 2014 of a Missouri fuel adjustment clause (FAC)-related 2013 charge. Factors negatively affecting the earnings comparison included increased depreciation and amortization and operations and maintenance expenses, as well as a higher effective income tax rate.  

“We delivered strong earnings growth in 2014 as we continued to successfully execute our strategic plan, which centers on investing in electric and gas utility infrastructure for the benefit of our customers and shareholders, while exercising disciplined cost management,” said Warner L. Baxter, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. “Construction of the FERC-regulated Illinois Rivers

NEWS RELEASE  

 Transmission Project proceeded as planned. In addition, Ameren Illinois exceeded its first-year goal for installing advanced electric and upgraded gas meters and received a constructive December electric delivery rate decision, demonstrating that Illinois’ formula rate framework is working as intended. Finally, Ameren Missouri installed a new reactor vessel head at the Callaway Nuclear Energy Center, added further environmental controls at the Labadie Energy Center and completed construction of a major substation in St. Louis and the largest investor-owned solar facility in the state. These projects are already serving Missouri customers and are eligible for inclusion in new rates to be effective by June of 2015.”  

Ameren recorded net income from continuing operations for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2014, of $46 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2013, of $48 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. Factors negatively affecting the earnings comparison included a scheduled fourth quarter 2014 nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center and increased depreciation and amortization expenses. The 2013 Callaway refueling and maintenance outage occurred in the spring of that year. In addition, FERC-regulated electric transmission service results decreased due to a reserve for a potential reduction in the allowed ROE, partially offset by the favorable effect of infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking. Further, electric and natural gas sales volumes declined, reflecting milder winter temperatures. Factors having a positive effect on the earnings comparison included decreased interest charges, increased Illinois electric delivery service earnings under formula ratemaking driven by infrastructure investments, and increased rates for Illinois natural gas delivery service effective January 2014.  

Earnings Guidance  

Ameren expects 2015 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 and continues to expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow at a 7% to 10% compound annual rate from 2013 through 2018. In addition, rate base is projected to grow at a 6% compound annual rate over the 2014 through 2019 period.  

Ameren’s earnings guidance assumes normal temperatures and, along with Ameren’s growth expectations, is subject to the effects of, among other things, 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields; regulatory decisions and legislative actions; energy center and energy delivery operations; energy, economic, capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.

Ameren Missouri Segment Results  

Ameren Missouri segment 2014 earnings were $390 million, compared to 2013 earnings of $395 million. This earnings decrease reflected increased operations and maintenance and depreciation and amortization expenses. The earnings comparison benefited from the absence in 2014 of the previously mentioned 2013 FAC-related charge.  

Ameren Illinois Segment Results  

Ameren Illinois segment 2014 earnings were $201 million, compared to 2013 earnings of $160 million. This earnings increase reflected increased Illinois electric delivery and FERC-regulated electric transmission services earnings driven by infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking. This increase in transmission services earnings was partially offset by a reserve for a potential reduction in the allowed ROE. The earnings comparison also benefited from increased rates for Illinois natural gas delivery service effective January 2014 and lower interest charges primarily due to a December 2014 regulatory decision allowing recovery of the majority of debt redemption costs initially disallowed and charged to earnings in 2013.  

Parent Company and Other  

The Parent Company and Other loss from continuing operations for 2014 was $4 million, compared to a loss of $43 million for 2013. This decreased loss reflected lower other operations and maintenance expenses, primarily due to the substantial elimination of business and administrative costs previously incurred in support of the divested merchant generation business, and decreased interest charges resulting from the May 2014 maturity of $425 million of parent company 8.875% senior notes that were repaid with lower-cost short-term debt. In addition, earnings from FERC-regulated Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois increased as a result of infrastructure investments made under formula ratemaking. This increase in transmission service earnings was partially offset by a reserve for a potential reduction in the allowed ROE. Finally, the earnings comparison was negatively affected by a higher effective income tax rate.
