JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - January 13, 2015 - CSX Corporation (NYSE: CSX) today announced record fourth-quarter 2014 net earnings of $491 million, a 15 percent increase from $426 million for the same period last year.

“CSX is capturing broad-based market strength, completing strategic infrastructure projects and adding resources to further improve service performance and leverage growth opportunities,” said Michael J. Ward, chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Building on a foundation of strong safety and customer service, we expect to continue growing our intermodal and merchandise businesses faster than the economy, pricing above inflation, and driving efficient asset utilization.”

Fourth-quarter revenue increased 5 percent to $3.2 billion, with strength across merchandise, intermodal and coal. The timely addition of operating resources enhanced service through the fall peak shipping season and supported volume growth. As a result, operating income increased 11 percent to $901 million, and the operating ratio improved 140 basis points to 71.8 percent.

For the full-year, CSX produced new all-time records for revenue of $12.7 billion, operating income of $3.6 billion, net earnings of $1.9 billion and earnings per share of $1.92. At the same time, the operating ratio remained relatively stable at 71.5 percent.

VOLUME AND REVENUE

Revenue increased 5% from the prior year's fourth quarter primarily driven by the 6% increase in volume from growth across most markets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Same store sales is defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity and car type, and the same origin and destination.

While revenue per unit was down slightly reflecting lower fuel recoveries, same store sales pricing increased as gains in merchandise and intermodal were partially offset by a decline in coal. Declines in coal pricing are due to continued rate pressure in the export markets and the impact of fixed/variable contracts in the domestic utility market where volume is increasing.

MERCHANDISE

Agricultural Sector

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

% of Carloads

Agricultural Products - Volume declined due to lower shipments of export grain and soybeans driven by market losses and resource constraints. 

Phosphates and Fertilizers - Volume growth was driven by an increase in phosphate rock, which increased as a result of capacity at a customer facility returning to normal levels, and potash shipments, which increased due to an extended shipping season during the mild winter in the quarter as well as the continued recovery from production and shipping delays earlier in 2014. 

Food and Consumer - Volume declined primarily due to lower shipments of appliances resulting from production changes at a customer location. These declines were partially offset by growth in alcoholic beverage shipments due to a customer’s gain in market share.

CSX Corporation

Industrial Sector

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

% of Carloads

Chemicals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in energy-related shipments that included crude oil, LPG and frac sand. The rise in crude oil shipments to east coast refineries was due to increased supply of crude oil from domestic shale drilling activity.

Automotive - Volume increased in finished vehicle shipments as North American light vehicle production grew. This growth was partially offset by customer transportation modal changes.

Metals - Volume growth was driven by an increase in sheet steel shipments due to higher automotive production and market gains.

Housing and Construction Sector

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

% of Carloads

Forest Products - Volume increased due to higher shipments of building products driven by the continued recovery in the residential housing market and pulpboard growth resulting from modal conversions and higher export shipments.

Minerals - Volume increased due to growth in aggregates (which includes crushed stone, sand and gravel) driven by the continued recovery in construction activity and the mild winter weather during the quarter.

Waste and Equipment - Volume increased due to growth in municipal solid waste shipments from a new service offering to a customer location. This growth was partially offset by lower industrial waste shipments due to the completion of a one-time remediation project.

COAL

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

% of Tons

Domestic Utility Coal - Volume increased 22% driven by utilities replenishing stockpiles ahead of winter heating season and market gain.

Domestic Coke, Iron Ore and Other - Volume increased 16% driven by stronger iron ore shipments associated with a new customer facility and stronger lake shipments.

Export Metallurgical Coal - Volume was up slightly on increased production from Southern Appalachian producers and increased demand for cheaper, high-volatility coals for steel production. 

Export Thermal Coal - Volume declined 20% as global market conditions continued to weaken.

INTERMODAL

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

% of Units

Domestic - Domestic volume increased 9% as a result of growth with existing customers and continued success with highway-to-rail conversions.

International - International volume increased 1% due to growth in global container shipments moving to inland destinations, partially offset by market losses.

EXPENSE

Expenses increased 3% or $72 million from the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher labor and fringe expense partially offset by lower fuel costs. Significant variances are described below. 

LABOR AND FRINGE

•During the fourth quarter, the Company initiated a management workforce reduction program which resulted in an initial charge of $39 million for the quarter. 

•Volume-related costs were $21 million higher primarily due to increased workforce levels to help capture strong customer demand.

•Inflation resulted in $21 million additional cost, driven mainly by union wage inflation.

•Labor costs were $15 million higher due to an amended locomotive maintenance agreement in mid-2014 where CSX now provides oversight of the labor force. Outside service costs shifted from materials, supplies and other to labor and fringe and overall expense is neutral for the quarter.

•Other costs were $10 million higher primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by reduced pension and post-retirement benefit costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND OTHER

•Volume-related costs rose $16 million to help capture strong customer demand.

•Inflation resulted in $11 million additional cost.

•Train accidents and other costs were $20 million lower primarily due to prior year train accident costs that did not repeat in the current period. 

•The amended locomotive maintenance agreement shifted $15 million to labor and fringe as referenced above.

CSX Corporation

FUEL 

•Volume-related costs were $25 million higher.

•Lower price (see chart below) decreased expense by $63 million. 

•Improved efficiency reduced expense by $7 million.

•Other fuel savings of $2 million were due to lower non-locomotive fuel costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

DEPRECIATION

Depreciation expense increased $9 million primarily due to a larger asset base partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from a periodic review of asset useful lives.

EQUIPMENT AND OTHER RENTS

•Car hire costs were $6 million higher due to volume and longer car cycle times.

•Inflation resulted in $4 million additional cost related to rates on automotive, intermodal and coal cars.

•Other costs rose $2 million.

OPERATING STATISTICS (Estimated)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SAFETY AND SERVICE

CSX remains an industry leader in employee safety. The FRA reportable personal injury frequency index improved 8 percent year over year to 0.81, and the reported FRA train accident frequency rate improved 15 percent to 1.8. Safety programs continue to focus on avoiding catastrophic events and minimizing the impact on the communities we serve.

Despite significant volume growth, CSX’s operations were stable and the company expects service to gradually improve to superior levels with the addition of strategic infrastructure investments, locomotives and operating employees coming online. While on-time originations decreased year over year to 52 percent and on-time arrivals declined to 43 percent, both were consistent with third quarter levels. Year over year, average train velocity declined to 20.4 miles per hour, and dwell worsened to 26.3 hours although both remain stable since last quarter.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED](a) Cars-on-line increased approximately 14,000 or 7.5% in 2014 due to a calculation error correction made by the American Association of Railroads in February 2014. This error impacted the industry cars-on-line since 2011. Previously reported amounts have not been adjusted to reflect this correction.
