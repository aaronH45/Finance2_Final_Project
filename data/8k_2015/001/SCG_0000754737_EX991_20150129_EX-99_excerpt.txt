(a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Alternate Base Rate Loan and LIBOR Rate Loan from the date of such Loan until such Loan shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

(i) if such Loan is an Alternate Base Rate Loan, a variable rate per annum equal at all times to the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Percentage, payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter commencing on March 31, 2015 while such Alternate Base Rate Loan is

20

outstanding and on the date such Alternate Base Rate Loan shall be Converted or paid in full; and

(ii) if such Loan is a LIBOR Rate Loan, a fixed rate per annum during the Interest Period equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Percentage, payable on the last day of the Interest Period and on the date such LIBOR Rate Loan shall be Converted or paid in full.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, for each day following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the outstanding principal of and (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) overdue interest on the Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the Default Rate, payable on demand.

(c) Interest with respect to Alternate Base Rate Loans due and payable in accordance with clause (a)(i) above shall accrue from the first day of such quarter until the last day of such quarter. Interest with respect to LIBOR Rate Loans due and payable in accordance with clause (a)(ii) above shall accrue from the first day of such Interest Period to but excluding the last day of such Interest Period, or, if applicable, to the end of each such three-month interval.

SECTION 2.08. [Reserved]. SECTION 2.09. [Reserved]. SECTION 2.10. [Reserved].

SECTION 2.11. Optional Prepayments.

The Borrower may, (a) upon at least one Business Day’s written notice to the Agent in the case of any Alternate Base Rate Loan and (b) upon at least three LIBOR Business Days’ notice in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loan, prepay any Alternate Base Rate Loan or LIBOR Rate Loan in whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating at least

$5,000,000 (and in increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof), by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment and any compensation payable pursuant to Section 2.12. The Agent shall deliver a copy of such notice to each Lender promptly upon receipt thereof.

SECTION 2.12. Compensation after Prepayment or Conversion.

The Borrower shall pay to such Lender any amounts which are required to compensate such Lender for any losses, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of any prepayment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.18(d).

SECTION 2.13. General Provisions as to Payments.

(a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York, New York time) on the date when due in federal or other funds immediately available to the Agent for each Lender at its Lending Office without setoff or counterclaim.

21

(b) Subject to subsection (c) of this Section 2.13, whenever any payment shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.

(c) Whenever any payment to be made hereunder in respect of any LIBOR Rate Loan, or in respect of interest computed at the LIBOR Rate, shall be stated to be due on a day other than a LIBOR Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding LIBOR Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of the payment of interest; provided that, if such extension of time would cause any such payment to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made, and the last day of the applicable Interest Period shall occur, on the next preceding LIBOR Business Day.

(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Agent on demand that amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

SECTION 2.14. Computation of Interest and Fees.

(a) The fees payable hereunder and interest on LIBOR Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed.

(b) Interest on Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of a 365- or

366-day year for the actual number of days elapsed for so long as the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate and on the basis of a 360-day year and paid for the actual number of days elapsed so long as the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Federal Funds Rate or LIBOR.

SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs.

(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or advances, loans or other credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate);

(ii) subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any LIBOR Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 2.16 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender); or

22

(iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting into or maintaining any LIBOR Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon written request of such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly pay to any such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time upon written request of such Lender the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. Such certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.

(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

(e) If any Lender shall subsequently recoup any costs (other than from the Borrower) for which such Lender has theretofore been compensated by the Borrower, such Lender shall remit to the Borrower an amount equal to the amount of such recoupment.

SECTION 2.16. Taxes.

23

(a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required by Applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Agent, the applicable Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.

(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.

(c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and each Lender, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.

(d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

(e) Status of Lenders. Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Applicable Law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below shall

24

not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally required to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

(i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY with attachments (to the extent such Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner) claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,

(ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,

(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of section

881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in section

881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service

Form W-8BEN, or

(iv) any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.

(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of- pocket expenses of the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Agent or such Lender in the event the Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (f) to the extent the payment of which would place the Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Agent or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be

25

construed to require the Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

(g) Survival. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Commitment.

(h) USA Patriot Act Notice; Compliance. In order for the Agent to comply with the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-56), prior to any Lender or Participant that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America becoming a party hereto, the Agent may request, and such Lender or Participant shall provide to the Agent, its name, address, tax identification number and/or such other identification information as shall be necessary for the Agent to comply with federal law.

SECTION 2.17. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or Section 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 7.05, all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:

(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee specified in

Section 7.05;

(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.18(d)) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

26

(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section

2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and

(iv) such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. An assignee Lender shall not constitute a Defaulting Lender pursuant to the terms hereof solely by virtue of an assignment in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.17(b).

SECTION 2.18. Interest Rate Determination; Changed Circumstances.

(a) Interest Rate Determination. Upon the request of the Borrower, each Lender agrees to furnish to the Borrower timely information sufficient to permit determination of an Alternate Base Rate or LIBOR Rate, as applicable; provided, however, that such information shall not be binding upon such Lender in determining any Alternate Base Rate or LIBOR Rate applicable to any Loan.

(b) Circumstances Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability. In connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or an Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR or a conversion to or continuation thereof, if for any reason (i) the Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, (ii) the Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan or any Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR or (iii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period, then the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower. Thereafter, until the Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans or an Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan or an Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR shall be suspended, and (i) in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans, the Borrower shall either (A) repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full) the then outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan together with accrued interest thereon (subject to Section 2.14), on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan; or (B) convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan to an Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR as of the last day of such Interest Period; or (ii) in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR, the Borrower shall convert the then outstanding principal

27

amount of each such Loan to an Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR as of the last day of such Interest Period.

(c) Laws Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability. If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in, any Applicable Law or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any LIBOR Rate Loan or any Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Agent and the Agent shall promptly give notice to the Borrower and the other Lenders. Thereafter, until the Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans or Alternate Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR, and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan or an Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR shall be suspended and thereafter the Borrower may select only Alternate Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR hereunder, (ii) all Alternate Base Rate Loans shall cease to be determined by reference to LIBOR and (iii) if any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable Loan shall immediately be converted to an Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR for the remainder of such Interest Period.

(d) Indemnity. The Borrower hereby indemnifies each of the Lenders against any loss or expense which may arise or be attributable to each Lender’s obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or maintain any Loan (a) as a consequence of any failure by the Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with a LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or notice of Conversion/Continuation in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D-2 (the “Notice of Conversion/Continuation”), (c) due to any payment, prepayment or conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor or (d) the assignment of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period or maturity date applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.17(b). The amount of such loss or expense shall be determined, in the applicable Lender’s sole discretion, based upon the assumption that such Lender funded its Commitment Percentage of the LIBOR Rate Loans in the London interbank market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical. A certificate of such Lender setting forth the basis for determining such amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error. Such certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.

SECTION 2.19. Conversion of Loans.

28

(a) The Borrower may on any Business Day (in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans) and on any LIBOR Business Day (in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans), upon notice given to the Lender not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York, New York time) on the second LIBOR Business Day prior to the date of any proposed Conversion into LIBOR Rate Loans and on the Business Day prior to the date of any proposed Conversion into Alternate Base Rate Loans subject to the provisions of Section 2.14, Convert any Loans of one Type into Loans of another Type or Types or Loans of the same Type having a new Interest Period; provided that any Conversion of, or with respect to, any LIBOR Rate Loan into Loans of another Type or Loans of the same Type having new Interest Periods shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Rate Loan, unless the Borrower shall also reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.12 on the date of such Conversion; provided further, that no Loan shall be converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan if any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. No LIBOR Rate Loan shall be in an aggregate principal amount of less than

$5,000,000. Each such Notice of a Conversion/Continuation, within the restrictions specified above, specifying therein (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Loans to be Converted and (iii) if such Conversion is into, or with respect to LIBOR Rate Loans, the duration of the Interest Period for each such Loan.

(b) If the Borrower shall fail to select the Type of any Loan or the duration of any Interest Period for any LIBOR Rate Loan in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of “Interest Period” in Section 1.01 and subsection (a) of this Section 2.19 or if any proposed Conversion of a Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan upon Conversion shall not occur as a result of the circumstances described in subsection (b) and (c) of Section 2.16 or subsection (c) of this Section 2.19, such Loan will automatically, on the last day of the then-existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into an Alternate Base Rate Loan.

(c) Each Notice of Conversion/Continuation given pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2.19 shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Loan that is to be converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan, the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders against any loss, cost or expense incurred by the Lenders as a result of any failure to fulfill on the date specified for such Conversion the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by the Lenders to fund such LIBOR Rate Loan, as the case may be, upon such Conversion, when such Conversion, as a result of such failure, does not occur. The Borrower’s obligations under this subsection (c) shall survive the repayment of all other amounts owing to the Lenders under this Agreement and the Notes and the termination of the Commitment.

(d) No more than six LIBOR Rate Loans may be outstanding at any time.

SECTION 2.20. Set-off.

(a) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the

29

Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or any such Affiliate, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or any such Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or any such Affiliate different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

(b) In addition to clause (a) above, with respect to any principal or interest payment, fee, or any other cost or expense (including legal fees and expenses), due and payable to the Agent or the Lenders under the Loan Documents, the Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Agent to debit any deposit account of the Borrower with the Agent (as one of the Lenders) in an amount such that the aggregate amount debited from all such deposit accounts does not exceed such payment, fee or other cost or expense. If there are insufficient funds in such deposit accounts to cover the amount of the payment, fee or other cost or expense then due, such debits will be reversed (in whole or in part, in the Agent’s sole discretion) and such amount not debited shall be deemed to be unpaid.

SECTION 2.21. Pro Rata Treatment.

Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

(a) Loans. Each Loan, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Loan, and each payment of interest on the Loans shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans. Each conversion or extension of any Loan shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans.

(b) Advances. Unless the Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a Borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its ratable share of such Borrowing available to the Agent, the Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Agent, and the Agent shall, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Agent by such Lender within the time period specified therefor hereunder, such Lender shall pay to the Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Agent, at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate; provided, however, that if payment is not made within three Business Days of demand, interest shall accrue at the rate applicable at that time to the Loans made in connection with such Borrowing. If such Lender’s pro rata share of such Borrowing is not made available to the Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of the date of such Borrowing, the Agent also shall be entitled to recover from the Borrower, within one Business Day after written demand, such amount with interest thereon, for the period until the Borrower makes such repayment amount immediately available to the Agent, at the rate applicable at that time to the Loans made in connection with such Borrowing. A certificate of the Agent submitted to any

30

Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

SECTION 2.22. Sharing of Payments.

The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan or any other obligation owing to such Lender under this Agreement through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker’s lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for in this Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a participation interest (a “Participation Interest”) in such Loans and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Agreement. The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker’s lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a Participation Interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a Participation Interest may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker’s lien or counterclaim, with respect to such Participation Interest as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such Participation Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if any Lender or the Agent shall fail to remit to the Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Agent to the Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 2.22 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 2.22 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

SECTION 2.23. [Reserved]. SECTION 2.24. Defaulting Lender.

(a) Waivers and Amendments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.

(b) Reallocation of Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 2.21(a), if any Defaulting Lender shall have failed to fund all or any portion of any Loan (each such Loan, 

31

an “Affected Loan”), each payment by the Borrower with respect to such Affected Loan hereunder shall be applied first to such Affected Loan and the principal amount and interest with respect to such payment shall be distributed (i) to each Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender (each, a “Non-Defaulting Lender”) pro rata based on the outstanding principal amount of Affected Loans owing to all Non-Defaulting Lenders, until the principal amount of all Affected Loans has been repaid in full and (ii) to the extent of any remaining amount of such payment, to each Lender as set forth in Section 2.21(a). Each payment made by the Borrower on account of the interest on any Affected Loans shall be distributed to each Non-Defaulting Lender pro rata based on the outstanding principal amount of Affected Loans owing to all Non-Defaulting Lenders.

(c) Fees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this section are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrower, the Agent or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.

(d) Termination. During any period that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower may terminate in full the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender by giving notice to such Defaulting Lender and the Agent (such termination, a “Defaulting Lender Termination”) so long as on the effective date of such Defaulting Lender Termination and after giving effect thereto and to any repayment of Loans in connection therewith: (i) no Default or Event of Default exists (unless the Required Lenders otherwise consent to such Defaulting Lender Termination) and (ii) no Loans shall be outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the effective date of such Defaulting Lender Termination (the “Defaulting Lender Termination Date”), which shall be not less than five (5) Business Days (or such shorter period as agreed to by the Agent and such Defaulting Lender) after the date on which such notice is delivered to such Defaulting Lender and the Agent. On each such Defaulting Lender Termination Date, (i) the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall be reduced to zero, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall cease to be a “Lender” hereunder (provided that any Defaulting Lender shall continue to be entitled to the indemnification provisions contained herein, but only with respect to matters arising prior to the applicable Defaulting Lender Termination Date) and (iii) the Commitment of all other Lenders shall remain unchanged.

(e) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower and the Agent agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Commitment Percentages, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change

32

hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of

any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

As of the applicable date of filing, based upon the Borrower’s knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the filing, the facts set forth in the Disclosure Documents regarding the Material Litigation were true and correct in all material respects. The Borrower does not believe that (a) the resolution of any litigation listed in Schedule 4.05 hereto could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) the resolution of any litigation set forth in the Disclosure Documents could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents.

(c) Except where the failure of any of the following representations to be correct could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has: (A) engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction described in

SECTION 4.07. Taxes.

There have been filed on behalf of the Borrower all material federal, state and local income, excise, property and other tax returns which are required to be filed by the Borrower except where the failure to file would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower has paid or will pay when due all taxes, assessments, governmental charges, claims except (x) liabilities being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently pursued and against which, if requested by the Required Lenders through the Agent, the Borrower shall have set up reserves satisfactory to the Required Lenders or (y) where nonpayment could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower in respect of taxes or other governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Borrower, adequate. United States income tax returns of the Borrower have been closed through the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2007.

The Borrower is not an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment

Company Act of 1940, as amended, or controlled by such a company.

Lenders will assume that all Informational Materials, other than publicly available Informational Materials filed pursuant to the Exchange Act or posted on Borrower’s website, include MNPI. The Borrower hereby agrees that in the event any Informational Materials will not contain MNPI, Borrower will notify Agent in writing (except with respect to Informational Materials filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, or posted on Borrower’s website, which shall be deemed public) and the Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the Agent, and the Lenders to treat such Informational Materials as not containing any MNPI (although it may be sensitive and proprietary) with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent such Informational Materials constitute Information, such Information shall be treated as set forth in Section 7.07 hereof).

The Borrower will (i) keep complete and accurate books and records of its transactions in accordance with good accounting practices on the basis of GAAP and (ii) permit representatives of the Agent at the Lenders’ expense so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and at the Borrower’s expense following the occurrence of a Default or Event of 

42

Default, to visit and inspect any of its Properties, to examine and make abstracts from any of its books and records and to discuss its affairs, finances and accounts with its officers, employees and independent public accountants; provided, however, that so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, an officer or authorized agent of the Borrower is (at the option of the Borrower) present during any such discussions with employees or accountants. The Borrower agrees to cooperate and assist in such visits and inspections, in each case at such reasonable times and as often as may reasonably be desired.

SECTION 5.03. Restrictions on Liens.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section.

(c) Register. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Toronto, Ontario, a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Agent, and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender (but only to the extent of entries in the Register that are applicable to such Lender), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Agent, and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver or modification described in Section 7.04 that directly affects such Participant and could not be affected by a vote of the Required Lenders. Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.16, 2.17 and 2.19 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.20 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section

2.22 as though it were a Lender.

Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to 

55

the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

(e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.16 and 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent. No Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender.

(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

SECTION 7.06. Nonliability of Agent and Lenders.

The relationship between the Borrower and the Lenders and the Agent shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower and no provision in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, and no course of dealing between or among any of the parties hereto, shall be deemed to create any fiduciary duty owing by the Agent or any Lender to any Lender, the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Neither the Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower’s business or operations. In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby, the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates' understanding, that (a) the credit facilities provided for hereunder and any related arranging or other services in connection therewith (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) are an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand; (b) neither the Agent nor any Lender has assumed or will assume any advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading hereto (irrespective of whether the Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates has advised or is currently advising the Borrower or any of its Affiliates on other matters) and neither the Agent nor any Lender has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (c) the Agent, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and

56

neither the Agent nor any Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship.

SECTION 7.07. Confidentiality.

Each of the Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and shall have expressly agreed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by, or required to be disclosed to, any rating agency, or regulatory or similar authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by Applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document (or any Hedging Agreement) or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document (or any Hedging Agreement with a Lender or the Agent) or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, Participant or proposed Participant, or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) to Gold Sheets and other similar bank trade publications, such information to consist of deal terms and other information customarily found in such publications, or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Agent or any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or (j) to governmental regulatory authorities in connection with any regulatory examination of the Agent or any Lender or in accordance with the Agent’s or any Lender’s regulatory compliance policy if the Agent or such Lender deems necessary for the mitigation of claims by those authorities against the Agent or such Lender or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; provided that if permitted by applicable law or regulation, the Borrower is given notice prior to such disclosure (other than routine regulatory requests) and is given an opportunity to obtain a protective order. For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof after the date hereof, such information is assumed to be confidential unless clearly identified at the time of delivery as public. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

SECTION 7.08. Representation by the Lender.

57

Each Lender hereby represents that it is a commercial lender or financial institution which makes loans in the ordinary course of its business and that it will make its Loans hereunder for its own account in the ordinary course of such business; provided that, subject to Section 7.05 of this Agreement, the disposition of the Notes or an interest in this Agreement held by such Lender shall at all times be within its exclusive control.

SECTION 7.09. Governing Law.

This Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of South Carolina.

SECTION 7.10. Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) The Borrower (i) submits to personal jurisdiction in the State of South Carolina, the courts thereof and the United States District Courts sitting therein, for the enforcement of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents and (ii) waives any and all personal rights under the law of any jurisdiction to object on any basis (including, without limitation, inconvenience of forum) to jurisdiction or venue within the State of South Carolina for the purpose of litigation to enforce this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents. Nothing herein contained, however, shall prevent any Lender from bringing any action or exercising any rights against any security and against the Borrower personally or against any assets of the Borrower, within any other state or jurisdiction.

(b) THE AGENT, THE LENDERS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN), OR ACTIONS OF THE AGENT, THE LENDERS OR THE BORROWER. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

SECTION 7.11. Interpretation.

No provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be construed against or interpreted to the disadvantage of any party hereto by any court or other governmental or judicial authority by reason of such party having or being deemed to have structured or dictated such provision.

SECTION 7.12. Counterparts.

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

SECTION 7.13. Entire Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII 

AGENCY PROVISIONS

SECTION 8.01. Appointment.

Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Royal Bank to act on its behalf as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.

SECTION 8.02. Rights as a Lender.

The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

SECTION 8.03. Exculpatory Provisions.

The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent:

(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law; and

(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information

59

relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the

Person serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 7.04) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Agent by, the Borrower or a Lender.

The Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent.

SECTION 8.04. Reliance by the Agent.

The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

SECTION 8.05. Delegation of Duties.

The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facilities as well as activities as Agent.

SECTION 8.06. Resignation and Termination of Agent.

60

(a) The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above provided that if the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 7.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as Agent.

(b) The Agent may be removed as administrative agent by all of the Lenders (other than the Lender then acting as Agent) and the Borrower upon 30 days' prior written notice if the Agent (i) is found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to have committed gross negligence or willful misconduct in the course of performing its duties hereunder or (ii) has become or is insolvent or has become the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or has had a receiver, conservator, trustee or custodian appointed for it, or has taken any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of or acquiescence in any such proceeding or appointment.

SECTION 8.07. Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

61

SECTION 8.08. No Other Duties, etc.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the sole lead arranger listed on the cover page or signature pages hereof shall not have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Agent or a Lender hereunder.

SECTION 8.09. Syndication Date.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the date of the first assignment by Royal Bank that is not an assignment of all of Royal Bank’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (such date, the “Syndication Date”), all references herein to the Agent shall be deemed references to Royal Bank, as the initial Lender (the “Initial Lender”), and notices shall be made to the Initial Lender. The Initial Lender shall provide the Borrower five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice of the Syndication Date. On and following the Syndication Date, all references to the Agent shall refer to the Agent, as defined pursuant to Section 1.01 hereof.
