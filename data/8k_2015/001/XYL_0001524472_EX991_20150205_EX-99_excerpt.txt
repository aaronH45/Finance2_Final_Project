RYE BROOK, N.Y., February 5, 2015 – Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported fourth quarter 2014 net income of $96 million, or $0.52 per share. Excluding the impact of restructuring, realignment and other special charges, the Company delivered adjusted net income of $114 million or $0.62 per share in the quarter, an 11-percent increase over the comparable period in 2013. Fourth quarter organic revenue grew 6 percent to $1.04 billion, reflecting stronger results from emerging markets and the U.S., as well as across all end markets. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margins improved 70 basis points, driven by higher volume and the impact of efficiency measures undertaken throughout the year. 

For the full year 2014, Xylem generated $3.92 billion in revenue, an organic increase of 3 percent over 2013. Full-year reported net income was $337 million, or $1.83 per share, with an operating margin of 11.8 percent. Adjusted net income, which excludes the impact of restructuring, realignment and other special items, was $362 million or $1.97 per share. Xylem delivered a full-year 2014 adjusted operating margin of 12.9 percent. Free cash flow was $297 million, up 50 percent versus last year. 

“Xylem delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, closing out 2014 with a clear strategic focus, stronger execution and a renewed drive in research and innovation,” said Patrick Decker, president and chief executive officer of Xylem. “We generated growth in each of our key regions in the fourth quarter, with notably strong results in China and the emerging markets in general. Solid growth in the U.S. and more effective execution across the company helped us to mitigate slower growth in Europe.”  

Decker continued, “During 2015, we will continue to strengthen critical organization capabilities in the areas of commercial excellence, innovation and technology, and emerging markets in order to accelerate Xylem’s growth. Our commitment to building a continuous improvement culture across the organization will drive efficiencies and enable us to continue to expand margins and reinvest for growth in our business. Our core fundamentals are strong and our 2015 plan tracks well with our long-term commitments to grow the company and our shareholders’ return.”  

Xylem today also announced that its Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.1408 per share for the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 10 percent. The dividend is payable on March 18, 2015 to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2015.  

Full-year 2015 Outlook  

Xylem forecasts full-year 2015 revenue of approximately $3.7 billion, a decrease of 5 to 7 percent over the 2014 results, including the projected unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, Xylem’s revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 1 to 3 percent.  

Full-year 2015 adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of $480 to $505 million, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. This represents a decline of 1 to 6 percent from Xylem’s 2014 adjusted results. Excluding the projected unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation, Xylem’s adjusted earnings per share growth is anticipated to be in the range of 5 to 10 percent. The company’s adjusted earnings outlook reflects projected restructuring and realignment costs of $20 million for the year.

Xylem Inc. Non-GAAP Measures  

Management views key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, free cash flow, working capital, and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:  

“Organic revenue” and “Organic orders” defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales of portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation or insignificant portions of our business that we did not classify as a discontinued operation. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency fluctuations assumes no change in exchange rates from the prior period.   

“Constant currency” defined as financial results adjusted for currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.  

“EBITDA” defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization expense, and share-based compensation. “Adjusted EBITDA” reflects the adjustment to EBITDA to exclude non-recurring restructuring and realignment costs, gain on sale of business and special charges.   

“Adjusted Operating Income”, “Adjusted Segment Operating Income”, and “Adjusted EPS” defined as operating income, segment operatng income and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude non-recurring restructuring and realignment costs, gain on sale of business, special charges and tax-related special items, as applicable.  

“Free Cash Flow” defined as net cash from operating activities, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flow, less capital expenditures as well as adjustments for other significant items that impact current results which management believes are not related to our ongoing operations and performance. Our definition of free cash flows does not consider non-discretionary cash payments, such as debt.   

“Realignment costs” defined as non-recurring costs not included in restructuring costs that are incurred as part of actions taken to reposition our business, including items such as professional fees, relocation, travel and other costs.  

“Special charges” defined as costs incurred by the Company associated with the settlement of legal proceedings with Xylem Group LLC and certain costs incurred for the change in chief executive officer made during the third quarter of 2013, as well as costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2013 for the contractual indemnification of federal tax obligations to ITT and costs associated with a legal judgment arising from a historical acquisition matter.
