AMERICAN EXPRESS EPS UP 15% FOR THE QUARTER; 14% FOR FULL YEAR 

CARD MEMBER SPENDING AND LOANS RISE 

INVESTMENT GAIN USED FOR BUSINESS BUILDING 

INITIATIVES AND RESTRUCTURING 

(Millions, except percentages and per share amounts)

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

New York – January 21, 2015– American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) today reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.4 billion, up 11 percent from $1.3 billion a year ago. Diluted earnings per share rose 15 percent to $1.39, from $1.21 a year ago. 

 1 Represents net income less earnings allocated to participating share awards of $11 million for both the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and $46 million and $47 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

-1- 

Fourth-quarter consolidated total revenues net of interest expense rose to $9.1 billion from $8.5 billion a year ago, up 7 percent (9 percent when adjusted for foreign currency translations2). The revenue increase primarily reflected the previously reported gain of $719 million ($453 million after-tax) on the sale of the company’s investment in Concur Technologies. The increase also reflected a rise in Card Member spending and higher net interest income. Last year’s fourth quarter included revenue from the company’s business travel operations, which were deconsolidated as a result of the joint venture transaction that closed on June 30, 2014.  

Consolidated provisions for losses totaled $582 million, up 22 percent from $479 million a year ago. The increase primarily reflected a build in reserves this quarter compared to a reserve release last year. Credit indicators continued to be at historically strong levels. 

Consolidated expenses totaled $6.3 billion, up 3 percent (6 percent FX adjusted2) from $6.1 billion a year ago. As indicated last quarter, the company used a substantial portion of the Concur gain for: 

  ·   Companywide initiatives to improve operating efficiencies, which entailed a restructuring charge of $313 million ($206 million after-tax);    

  ·   Incremental investments in growth initiatives, which were largely reflected in higher marketing and promotion expenses; and    

  ·   The renewal of the company’s partnership with Delta Air Lines, which created additional rewards costs of $109 million ($68 million after-tax).    

In addition, fourth-quarter results were negatively affected by the impact of foreign currency translations on international operations. 

The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35 percent, up from 34 percent from a year ago, driven by the geographic mix of earnings and the resolution of certain prior years’ items. 

The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 29.1 percent, up from 27.8 percent a year ago. 

For the full year, the company reported net income of $5.9 billion, up 10 percent from $5.4 billion a year ago. Diluted earnings per share rose 14 percent to $5.56 from $4.88 a year ago. 

Revenues net of interest expense for the full year increased 4 percent (5 percent FX adjusted2) to $34.3 billion from $33.0 billion a year ago. Consolidated expenses remained unchanged from 2013 at $23.3 billion. Adjusted for foreign currency translations2, consolidated expenses were up 1 percent. 

“Solid results this quarter reflected the underlying themes that have characterized our performance throughout 2014: higher Card Member spending, increased loan balances, tight control of operating expenses and a substantial return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases,” said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer. 

“Fourth-quarter Card Member spending rose 6 percent (8 percent FX adjusted). Volumes for the year crossed the trillion dollar mark for the first time, reflecting the progress we’ve made in building customer loyalty, adding new cards and expanding the network of merchants who accept our products. Loan balances were up 7 percent in the U.S., continuing the progress we’ve made throughout 2014. We continue to see opportunities to grow this portfolio with existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. 

 2 As reported in this release, FX adjusted information, which constitute non-GAAP financial measures, assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translations into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the three months ended December 31, 2014 apply to the period(s) against which such results are being compared). The company believes the presentation of information on an FX adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the company’s performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

“Tight controls on the cost side of the ledger continued to give us the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities. And, as in the second quarter, a substantial gain allowed us to accelerate some critical initiatives: reengineering to make American Express more efficient; renewing a key partner relationship; and making additional investments to grow our business and drive innovation in the world of payments and commerce. 

“We’ve made very good progress against the backdrop of an uneven global economy and the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. We see many opportunities for growth, but at the same time, we face competitive and regulatory challenges. Our aim is to continue to capitalize on the opportunities while dealing with the challenges as we enter 2015.”

-3- 

Taxes for the quarter reflected the level of pretax income in combination with recurring permanent tax benefits.

Total expenses decreased 4 percent to $772 million (1 percent FX adjusted2) from $801 million a year ago. The decrease reflected merchant litigation settlement expenses a year ago, partially offset by higher marketing and promotion costs in the current quarter.

  Appendix VI   (Preliminary)    

All Information in the preceding tables is presented on a basis prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), unless otherwise indicated. Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation. 

  (A)   Represents net income, less earnings allocated to participating share awards of $11 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, $11 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, $12 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, $12 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, and $11 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2013.    

  (B)   Refer to Appendix I for components of return on average equity, return on average common equity and return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure.    

  (C)   Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the issuer is located.    

  (D)   Total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee Card Members. Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand Card Member accounts that have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12 month period.    

  (E)   This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and Global Network Services) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.    

  (F)   Average basic Card Member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. Average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force. The adjusted average fee per card, which is a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. The amount of amortization excluded for these periods was $79 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, $77 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, $77 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, $73 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, and $64 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2013. The Company presents adjusted average fee per card because the Company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products.    

  (G)   Provisions for principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee reserve components.    

  (H)   Consists of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), interest and/or fees, less recoveries.    

  (I)   Beginning in first quarter 2014, reserves related for card-related fraud losses are reflected in Other liabilities. All periods include foreign currency translation adjustments and other items.    

  (J)   The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because the Company's practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of its total provision for losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.    

  (K)   See Appendix III for quarterly calculations of net interest yield on Card Member loans, a non-GAAP measure, and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure, and the Company's rationale for presenting net interest yield on Card Member loans. For calculations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, please refer to Annex 3 of the Company’s 2014 Fourth Quarter/ Full Year Earnings Supplement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    

  (L)   Historically, net loss ratio as a % of charge volume and 90 days past billings as a % of receivables were presented for ICS and GCS. As a result of system enhancements, beginning in first quarter 2014, 30 days past due as a % of total, net write-off rate (principal only) and net write-off rate (principal and fees) will be presented for ICS.     

  (M)   Segment capital represents capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements.    

  (N)   Refer to Appendix II for components of return on average segment capital and return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure.    

  (O)   See Appendix IV for calculations of net interest yield on Card Member loans, a non-GAAP measure, and net interest income divided by average loans, a GAAP measure, and the Company's rationale for presenting net interest yield on Card Member loans.    

  (P)   Global Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in Global Network Services, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business.    

  (Q)   Return on average equity and return on average common equity are calculated by dividing one year period net income/net income attributable to common shareholders by one year average total shareholders’ equity/average common shareholders' equity, respectively.    

  (R)   Return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average common equity except the computation of average tangible common shareholders' equity, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average common shareholders' equity, average goodwill and other intangibles. The Company believes that return on average tangible common equity is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.    

  (S)   Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing one year period segment income by one year average segment capital. Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes average goodwill and other intangibles. The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.     

  (T)   Adjusted net interest income, a non-GAAP measure, represents net interest income allocated to the Company's Card Member loan portfolio excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to the Company's Card Member loan portfolio. The Company believes adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on Card Member loans.     

  (U)   Adjusted average loans, a non-GAAP measure, represents average Card Member loans excluding the impact of deferred card fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs of Card Member loans, and other. The Company believes adjusted average loans is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on Card Member loans.    

  (V)   This calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on Card Member loans. The calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to Card Member loans, and interest expense attributable to other activities, including Card Member receivables.    

  (W)   Net interest yield on Card Member loans, a non-GAAP measure, is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis. The calculation of net interest yield on Card Member loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on Card Member loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses - Card Member loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation. The Company believes net interest yield on Card Member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Company's Card Member loan portfolio.    

  (X)   Revenue net of interest expense and total expenses on an FX adjusted basis are a non-GAAP measures. FX adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes Q3’14 foreign exchange rates apply to Q3'13 results). The Company’s calculations of non-GAAP measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures of other companies.
