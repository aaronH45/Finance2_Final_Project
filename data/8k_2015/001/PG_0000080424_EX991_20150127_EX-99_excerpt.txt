P&G DELIVERS SECOND QUARTER CURRENCY-NEUTRAL CORE EPS UP 6%;

MAINTAINS ORGANIC SALES AND CURRENCY-NEUTRAL CORE EPS GROWTH OUTLOOKS FOR FISCAL YEAR;

ADJUSTS FISCAL YEAR EARNINGS TARGETS FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE

CINCINNATI, Jan. 27, 2015 - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported second quarter fiscal year 2015 core earnings per share of $1.06 versus $1.15 the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core earnings per share increased six percent. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.82, including non-core items which reduced diluted EPS by $0.24 per share. Organic sales grew two percent for the quarter. Reported net sales were $20.2 billion, a decrease of four percent versus the prior year, including a negative five percentage point impact from foreign exchange. 

"The October - December 2014 quarter was a challenging one with unprecedented currency devaluations," said Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley. "Virtually every currency in the world devalued versus the U.S. dollar, with the Russian Ruble leading the way. While we continue to make steady progress on the strategic transformation of the company - which focuses P&G on about a dozen core categories and 70 to 80 brands, on leading brand growth, on accelerating meaningful product innovation and increasing productivity savings - the considerable business portfolio, product innovation, and productivity progress was not enough to overcome foreign exchange." 

"The outlook for the year will remain challenging. Foreign exchange will reduce fiscal 2015 sales by 5% and net earnings by 12%, or at least $1.4 billion after tax. We have and will continue to offset as much of this currency impact as we can through productivity driven cost savings. And we will continue to invest in our businesses, brands and product innovation, because it is the right thing to do for the mid- and long-term, while we deliver another year of strong cash returns to shareowners. We are adjusting fiscal year earnings targets accordingly. We are mobilized to deliver another fiscal year of modest organic sales growth, 

and to continue to grow market share on more category-leading brands. We are working to deliver core earnings per share as close as possible to those of last fiscal year."

October - December Quarter Discussion

Net sales decreased four percent versus year ago to $20.2 billion in the October - December quarter, including a negative five percent impact from foreign exchange. Organic sales were up two percent, with growth in four of five reporting segments. Organic volume was unchanged versus the prior year. Pricing added one percentage point to sales growth, and geographic and product mix was also positive. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Other includes the sales mix impact of acquisitions/divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales

•Beauty, Hair and Personal Care segment organic sales decreased one percent driven primarily by declines in the Prestige and Skin and Personal Care categories. This was partially offset by innovation-driven sales growth in the Salon Professional and Antiperspirant & Deodorant businesses.

•Grooming segment organic sales increased two percent due to higher pricing and innovation on Gillette grooming and innovation on Braun. This growth was partially offset by lower shipment volume.

•Health Care segment organic sales increased one percent behind growth in Oral Care from innovation and increased pricing. These improvements were partially offset by lower volume in Personal Health Care, primarily from a decline on Prilosec due to a new market entrant. 

•Fabric Care and Home Care segment organic sales increased three percent as growth on Fabric Care from product innovations and consumer value corrections were partially offset by lower volume in Home Care, mainly in Asia. 

•Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales increased four percent behind pricing and innovation in Baby Care and Feminine Care, partially offset by lower sales in Family Care due to a soft period in Mexico and consumer value interventions in the U.S. 

Core earnings per share were $1.06, a decrease of eight percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange reduced core earnings by about $0.16 per share, resulting in a 14% decrease in core earnings per share. Excluding these foreign exchange impacts, constant currency core EPS increased 6%. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.82, including a loss on discontinued operations of $0.20 and other non-core charges of $0.04. The loss in discontinued operations includes a $0.26 per share non-cash impairment charge in the battery business. For a full reconciliation of non-core items, please see Exhibit #1: Non-GAAP Measures. 

Core operating profit margin decreased 60 basis points due to a decrease in core gross margin of about 20 basis points and an increase in core SG&A as a percentage of net sales of about 30 basis points. Reported operating profit margin decreased 80 basis points. Reported gross margin decreased 40 basis points as manufacturing savings of 190 basis points were more than offset by unfavorable geographic and product mix, unfavorable foreign exchange, higher commodity costs, incremental restructuring charges and innovation and capacity expansion investments. Reported SG&A as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points as productivity savings of 70 basis points from overhead and 70 basis points of marketing efficiencies, primarily in non-working marketing spending areas, were more than offset by foreign exchange impacts and overhead investments. Total productivity savings in cost of goods sold and SG&A were 330 basis points. 

P&G generated operating cash flow of $3.4 billion for the quarter. P&G returned $3.7 billion in cash to shareholders, including $1.8 billion in dividends and $1.9 billion of common stock repurchases. Fiscal year-to-date, P&G has returned approximately $7.9 billion to shareholders via $3.6 billion in dividends and $4.3 billion in stock repurchases. Fiscal year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow productivity is 95%.

Discontinued Operations

As a result of the previously announced divestiture of its Duracell battery business to Berkshire Hathaway, expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2015, and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the results of the batteries business are presented as discontinued operations. During the quarter, the Company took a non-cash charge of $740 million after-tax, or $0.26 per share, included in 

discontinued operations to adjust the carrying values of the batteries business to reflect the value it expects to receive. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Company previously took a write down in the asset value of its battery business to be more reflective of the value it expected to receive from the sale of its interest in a China-based battery joint venture, which closed as expected during the second quarter.

Fiscal Year 2015 Guidance

P&G maintained its organic sales growth and currency-neutral core earnings per share growth guidance ranges for fiscal year 2015. The Company expects significant negative sales and earnings impacts from foreign exchange in the second half of its fiscal year.

The Company maintained its guidance for organic sales growth in the low-to-mid single digit range. Net sales growth is now expected to be lower versus the prior fiscal year in the range of -3% to -4%, including a negative five point headwind from foreign exchange and a one point impact from minor brand divestitures. 

P&G maintained its outlook for currency-neutral core earnings per share growth in the double-digits. Including currency impacts, Core EPS is now expected to be in the range of in-line to down low-single digits versus prior year Core EPS of $4.09. All-in GAAP diluted net earnings per share are now expected to be down in the mid-teens range versus the prior year. This includes approximately $0.67 per share of non-core charges, primarily from $0.20 per share of non-core restructuring charges and $0.58 of impairment charges, which are partially offset by approximately $0.14 of earnings from discontinued Batteries and Pet Care operations.

Exhibit 1: Non-GAAP Measures

In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in the earnings release and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure.

Organic Sales Growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.

The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes volume and mix impacts of acquired and divested businesses, as well as rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.

Core EPS and Currency-neutral Core EPS: Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges in both years for European legal matters and incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings. We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.

Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We believe the currency-neutral Core EPS measure provides a more comparable view of year-on-year earnings per share growth.

The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS and Core EPS to Currency-neutral Core EPS:
