Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On December 30, 2014, Ken C. Hicks, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Foot Locker, Inc. (the “Company”), entered into a prearranged stock trading plan (the “Plan”) to exercise options to purchase a maximum of 400,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and to sell such shares acquired upon exercise of the options beginning February 4, 2015 if the common stock reaches specified market prices. The shares acquired upon exercise will be sold contemporaneously with each exercise. The Plan was put in place for Mr. Hicks’ personal financial management and diversification purposes in connection with his upcoming retirement. Assuming the full execution of the Plan, Mr. Hicks will continue to hold approximately 500,000 shares of common stock and will have approximately 2,000,000 options outstanding. 

The Plan was designed to comply with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which permit persons to enter into a prearranged plan for buying or selling Company stock at a time when such person is not in possession of material, nonpublic information about the Company. Transactions made under the Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as may be required by law, the Company does not undertake to report on specific Rule 10b5-1 prearranged stock trading plans of Company officers or directors, nor to report modifications or terminations of the aforementioned Plan or the plan of any other individual.
