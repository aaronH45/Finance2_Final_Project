Tesoro Corporation Reports 2014 Fourth Quarter and Record Full Year Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Approved a 40% increase to regular quarterly dividend to $0.425 per share

•Successful close of the $2.5 billion Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition

•Achieved annual business improvements of $560 million in 2014 exceeding goal by over 30%

•Record retail performance with $195 million of segment operating income in the fourth quarter 

SAN ANTONIO - February 11, 2015 - Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported fourth quarter 2014 net earnings of $145 million or $1.13 per diluted share versus last year’s $7 million loss and full year 2014 net earnings of $843 million or $6.44 per diluted share, up 105% over 2013 net earnings of $412 million. 

Adjusted Earnings for the fourth quarter, excluding special items of $15 million, were $187 million or $1.46 per diluted share. Special items include expenses related to transaction and integration costs associated with completing the Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition, an inventory adjustment due to the lower of cost or market valuation, a throughput deficiency receivable from the Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition and a benefit related to net legal settlements. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS were negatively impacted by $69 million of compensation related costs for Tesoro and $17 million from an environmental accrual in our logistics business. Neither of these costs, which equate to $0.37 per diluted share, were included in our original guidance for costs in the fourth quarter. These costs are not clearly identifiable within our financial statements accompanying this release. 

“2014 was a very successful year for the Company - not only from a financial standpoint - but also from our excellent safety and operating performance” said Greg Goff, Chairman, President and CEO. “We exceeded the Distinctive Performance Objectives we laid out for the company and have continued to transform Tesoro with the acquisition of the natural gas business within Tesoro Logistics LP. We returned over $600 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and invested an additional $500 million in Tesoro Logistics during 2014.”

The fourth quarter 2014 results were driven by strong refining, marketing and logistics performance. “Our record retail results highlight the value of our integrated business model,” said Goff.

The refining segment’s operating income of $151 million for the quarter was driven by strong fundamentals and consumer demand. The Tesoro Index was $9.45 per barrel (/bbl) for the quarter, up about $1.80/bbl relative to a year ago. Overall gross margin for the quarter was $11.08/bbl or 117% of the Tesoro Index, compared to $9.45/bbl or 124% of the Tesoro Index last year. As part of our continued commitment to improving our refining performance, we produced an additional 60 thousand barrels per day of higher value distillate products than the prior year, increasing our yield of these products by 1.5%. Total refinery throughput for the quarter was 808 thousand barrels per day, or 95% utilization. Direct manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter 2014 relative to the third quarter 2014 were up $0.12/bbl to $5.54/bbl.

The logistics segment’s operating income has seen substantial growth driven by increased throughput in the High Plains Pipeline system in North Dakota and significant growth from the West Coast products distribution assets. On December 2, 2014, Tesoro Logistics LP (“TLLP”) completed the acquisition of the Rockies Natural Gas Business, marking a significant step towards our vision of creating a full-service, integrated logistics company. As part of this transaction Tesoro acquired an additional $500 million of TLLP units.

The retail segment’s record operating income in the fourth quarter of $195 million was a result of favorable market conditions resulting from strong demand and decreasing crude oil prices. The lower retail prices have resulted in strong consumer demand and sales from our ARCO® network, and our expanding Exxon® and Mobil® retail network. Same store fuel sales were higher during the quarter by approximately 1.5% versus fourth quarter last year. 

Corporate and unallocated costs were $101 million, including $4 million of corporate depreciation. This is higher than our guidance and run rate of $60 million due to higher compensation related costs.

Capital Spending and Liquidity 

Capital spending for the fourth quarter 2014 was $208 million for Tesoro and $107 million for TLLP. Capital spending for the full year 2014 was $535 million for Tesoro and $244 million for TLLP. Full year 2015 capital spending is expected to be $570 million for Tesoro and $450 million for TLLP. Turnaround expenditures for the fourth quarter were $108 million. Turnaround expenditures for the full year were $196 million. Full year 2015 turnaround expenditures of $280 million are expected.

Tesoro ended the fourth quarter with $1.0 billion in cash and $2.2 billion of availability on the revolving credit facility. There are currently no borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Excluding TLLP debt and equity, total debt was $1.7 billion or 27% of total capitalization at the end of the fourth quarter 2014. On a consolidated basis, total outstanding debt was $4.3 billion or 38% of total capitalization.

TLLP ended the quarter with $260 million in borrowings under its separate revolving credit facility.

Returning Cash to Shareholders

During the fourth quarter, Tesoro returned about $187 million to shareholders through the purchase of nearly 2.2 million shares for $150 million and its regular quarterly dividend of $37 million.

Tesoro completed the previously existing $1.0 billion share repurchase program during 2014. Tesoro expects to continue to focus on opportunistic repurchases in 2015 under the new $1.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in July 2014.

Tesoro Corporation today also announced that the board of directors has approved an increase in the regular quarterly dividend by 40% to $0.425 per share payable on March 13, 2015, to all holders of record as of February 27, 2015.

Strategic Update

Through the end of December we estimate that we delivered $560 million in 2014 towards our ongoing Distinctive Performance Objectives around California synergies and business improvements. These objectives, which focus on improving gross margin and managing our costs to drive improvement in operating income, are clearly reflected in our record results this year.

“Tesoro is well positioned to move forward and achieve our business improvement objectives for 2015 by delivering additional annual improvements of $550 to $670 million,” said Goff. “We are focused on delivering the West Coast Improvements, Capturing Margin Improvements and Growing our Logistics business while maintaining strong financial discipline.” 

The permit process for the Vancouver Energy project, to construct a 360 thousand barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal, is continuing to progress with Washington State’s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Committee (“EFSEC”). EFSEC has begun the adjudicative phase and based on the schedule it laid out is expected to release the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in May of 2015. We still expect EFSEC will submit its recommendation to the governor of Washington once it completes the adjudicative phase.

Non-GAAP Measures

Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze operating segment performance. To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), our management uses additional metrics that are known as “non-GAAP” financial metrics in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (“EBITDA”). We define EBITDA as consolidated earnings, including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest and financing costs, income taxes and interest income. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus or minus amounts determined to be “special items” by our management based on their unusual nature and relative significance to earnings (loss) in a certain period. We provide complete reconciliation and discussion of items identified as special items with our presentation of adjusted EBITDA.

We present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe some investors and analysts use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to help analyze our cash flows including our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness and use cash for other purposes, including capital expenditures. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are also used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and by management for internal analysis. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to U.S. GAAP net earnings or net cash from operating activities. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and net cash from operating activities.

We present net earnings from continuing operations adjusted for special items (“Adjusted Earnings”) and net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations adjusted for special items (“Adjusted Diluted EPS”) as management believes that the impact of these items on net earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is important information for an investor’s understanding of the operations of our business and the financial information presented. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings, earnings per diluted share or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.

Items Impacting Comparability

As of December 31, 2013, we began reporting the logistics assets and operations of TLLP as a separate operating segment. In previous periods, when certain quantitative thresholds had not been met, TLLP’s assets and operations were presented within our refining operating segment. TLLP’s assets and operations include certain crude oil gathering assets and crude oil and refined products terminalling and transportation assets acquired from Tesoro and third parties. The historical results of operations of these assets have been retrospectively adjusted to conform to current presentation. These adjustments resulted in lower gross refining margins. The refining segment now includes costs for transportation and terminalling services provided by TLLP that were previously eliminated with consolidated reporting of TLLP revenues within our refining segment results.

The TLLP financial and operational data presented include the historical results of all assets acquired from Tesoro prior to the acquisition dates. The acquisitions from Tesoro were transfers between entities under common control. Accordingly, the financial information of TLLP contained herein has been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the assets acquired in the acquisitions from Tesoro prior to the effective date of each acquisition for all periods presented.

On September 25, 2013, we completed the sale of all of our interest in Tesoro Hawaii, LLC, which operated a 94 thousand barrel per day Hawaii refinery, retail stations and associated logistics assets (the “Hawaii Business”). We have reflected its results of operations as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented, and, unless otherwise noted, we have excluded the Hawaii Business from the financial and operational data presented in the tables and discussion that follow.

(j)We define heavy crude oil as crude oil with an American Petroleum Institute gravity of 24 degrees or less.

(k)Sources of total refined product sales include refined products manufactured at our refineries and refined products purchased from third parties. Total refined product sales margins include margins on sales of manufactured and purchased refined products.

(l)Consolidated gross refining margin combines gross refining margin for each of our regions adjusted for other amounts not directly attributable to a specific region. Gross refining margin includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market and fees charged by TLLP for the transportation and terminalling of crude oil and refined products at prices which we believe are no less favorable to either party than those that could have been negotiated with unaffiliated parties with respect to similar services. Gross refining margin approximates total refining throughput multiplied by the gross refining margin per barrel.

(m)Management uses various measures to evaluate performance and efficiency and to compare profitability to other companies in the industry, including gross refining margin per barrel, manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization expense (“Manufacturing Costs”) per barrel and refined product sales margin per barrel. We calculate gross refining margin per barrel by dividing gross refining margin (revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution) by total refining throughput. We calculate Manufacturing Costs per barrel by dividing Manufacturing Costs by total refining throughput. We calculate refined product sales margin per barrel by dividing refined product sales margin by total refining throughput. Refined product sales margin represents refined product sales less refined product cost of sales. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(n)The gross refining margin per throughput barrel excludes of the impact the $42 million lower of cost or market adjustment recognized at December 31, 2014 in the computation of the rate at a consolidated or regional level.

(p)In September 2013, TLLP responded to the release of crude oil in a rural field northeast of Tioga, North Dakota (the “Crude Oil Pipeline Release”). The environmental liabilities related to the Crude Oil Pipeline Release include amounts estimated for remediation activities that will be conducted during the next few years to restore the site for agricultural use. TLLP accrued an additional $17 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to reflect improved scope definition and estimates which resulted in an increase in the total estimated cost associated with the project.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]
