Equity Residential Reports Full Year 2014 Results

2014 Normalized FFO Per Share Increased 11.2%

2015 Normalized FFO Per Share Expected to Increase 7.3% 

2015 Common Share Dividend Expected to Increase 10.5%

Chicago, IL - February 3, 2015 - Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. All per share results are reported as available to common shares on a diluted basis.

“2014 was another exceptional year for Equity Residential in which we delivered year over year growth in Normalized FFO per share of more than 11%, among the best years in our history,” said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential’s President and CEO. “Improving labor markets, robust household formation and declining single family home ownership levels will keep demand for rental housing high and produce above trend growth for many years to come.”

Fourth Quarter 2014

FFO (Funds from Operations), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $0.87 per share compared to $0.67 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. The difference is due primarily to higher prepayment penalties incurred in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the items described below. 

For the fourth quarter of 2014, the company reported Normalized FFO of $0.86 per share compared to $0.77 per share in the same period of 2013. The following items impacted Normalized FFO per share in the quarter:

•a positive impact of approximately $0.07 per share from higher same store net operating income (NOI) and approximately $0.02 per share from NOI from non-same store properties currently in lease-up; 

•a positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share from lower G&A expenses; and

•a negative impact of approximately $0.01 per share due to dilution from the timing of the company’s 2014 transaction activity.

Normalized FFO begins with FFO and eliminates certain items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period or that tend to obscure the company’s actual operating performance. Reconciliations and definitions of FFO and Normalized FFO are provided on pages 6 and 28 of this release and the company has included guidance for Normalized FFO on page 27 and FFO on page 28 of this release.

For the fourth quarter of 2014, the company reported earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. The difference is due primarily to higher gains on property sales in the fourth quarter of 2014, higher prepayment penalties incurred in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the items described above. 

Year Ended December 31, 2014 

FFO for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $3.15 per share compared to $2.35 per share in the same period of 2013. The difference is due primarily to higher acquisition expenses and prepayment penalties incurred during 2013 and improved operations during 2014.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the company reported Normalized FFO of $3.17 per share compared to $2.85 per share in the same period of 2013.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the company reported earnings of $1.73 per share compared to $5.16 per share in the same period of 2013. The difference is due primarily to higher gains on property sales during 2013, partially offset by higher depreciation expense, acquisition expenses and prepayment penalties incurred during 2013 and improved operations during 2014. 

Same Store Results 

The company’s same store results for all periods include the stabilized apartment units acquired in the Archstone acquisition that are owned and managed by the company.

On a same store fourth quarter to fourth quarter comparison, which includes 98,421 apartment units, revenues increased 4.9%, expenses increased 2.2% and NOI increased 6.3%.

On a same store year to year comparison, which includes 97,911 apartment units, revenues increased 4.3%, expenses increased 1.8% and NOI increased 5.6%.

Investment Activity 

The company acquired two properties during the fourth quarter, both in Seattle, with a total of 273 apartment units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $94.2 million at a weighted average capitalization (cap) rate of 4.8%. Also during the quarter, the company acquired its joint venture partner’s 95% interest in Parc on Powell, a 176-unit apartment property currently under development in Emeryville, a suburb of San Francisco, for a stabilized value of $87.5 million. The company acquired its original 5% interest in the property as part of the Archstone acquisition. The project is expected to stabilize in the second year of full ownership at a 4.8% yield on cost.

During the fourth quarter, the company sold six consolidated apartment properties, consisting of 1,775 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $269.9 million at a weighted average cap rate of 5.9%. These sales generated an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR), inclusive of management costs, of 6.5%. Also during the quarter, the company sold for approximately $62.5 million an unconsolidated 388-unit apartment property located in Phoenix, in which it had an 85% interest acquired as part of the Archstone transaction. In addition, the company sold a land parcel located in Los Angeles for a sale price of $32.1 million during the quarter.

During 2014, the company acquired six properties, consisting of 1,353 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $469.8 million and a weighted average cap rate of

4.9%. In addition, the company acquired two land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $28.8 million as well as the Parc on Powell transaction described above.

During 2014, the company sold 10 consolidated apartment properties, consisting of 3,092 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $467.0 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.1%. These sales generated an unlevered IRR, inclusive of management costs, of 8.9%. The company also sold three land parcels for an aggregate sale price of $62.6 million during 2014. In addition, the company sold the unconsolidated asset in Phoenix described above.

Revised Executive Compensation Program

In response to input from its shareholders, the company has revised its executive compensation program beginning in 2015. The long term incentive portion of the revised program will be performance based and determined by the company’s absolute and relative total shareholder return over the three year performance period ending December 31, 2017. Accounting rules require the company to expense in 2015 a portion of both the previous program’s time based equity grants for service in 2014 and the performance based grants issued under the revised plan creating a duplicative charge of approximately $11.0 million. This charge will not be included in the company’s Normalized FFO in 2015.

First Quarter 2015 Guidance 

The company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $0.77 to $0.81 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The difference between the company’s fourth quarter 2014 Normalized FFO of $0.86 per share and the midpoint of the first quarter 2015 guidance range of $0.79 per share is due primarily to:

•a negative impact of approximately $0.05 per share from lower NOI primarily as a result of higher operating expenses in the first quarter of 2015; and

•a negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from other items.

Full Year 2015 Guidance 

The company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share for the full year 2015. The assumptions underlying this guidance can be found on page 27 of this release. The difference between the company’s full-year 2014 Normalized FFO of $3.17 per share and the midpoint of the full year 2015 guidance range of $3.40 per share is primarily due to:

•a positive impact of approximately $0.21 per share from higher NOI from same store properties; 

•a positive impact of approximately $0.05 per share from non-same store properties, including properties in lease-up;

•a negative impact of approximately $0.04 per share from the timing of the company’s 2014 and 2015 transaction activity;

•a positive impact of approximately $0.03 per share from lower interest expense; and

•a negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from other items.

2015 Common Share Dividend

Based on the guidance above, the company expects to pay four quarterly dividends of $0.5525 per share for an annual dividend of $2.21 per share in 2015, which represents a 10.5% increase over the 2014 dividend. All future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the company’s Board of Trustees.

Definitions and Footnotes for Pages 6, 26 and 27

(1)The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of apartment units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property.

(2)Normalized funds from operations ("Normalized FFO") begins with FFO and excludes:

 • the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating asset impairment and valuation allowances;

 • property acquisition and other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and pursuit cost write-offs;

 • gains and losses from early debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties, preferred share redemptions and the cost related to the implied option value of non-cash convertible debt discounts;

 • gains and losses on the sales of non-operating assets, including gains and losses from land parcel and condominium sales, net of the effect of income tax benefits or expenses; and

 • other miscellaneous non-comparable items.

(3)The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. The Company also believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the Company's operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company's actual operating results. FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

(4)FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

(5)Earnings represents net income per share calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Expected earnings is calculated on a basis consistent with actual earnings. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual earnings could differ materially from expected earnings.
