Commercial Paper Dealer Agreement  

4(a)(2) Program  

This agreement (the “Agreement”) sets forth the understandings between the Issuer and the Dealer, each named on the cover page hereof, in connection with the issuance and sale by the Issuer through the Dealer of the Issuer’s short-term promissory notes in (i) substantially the form scheduled to the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement or (ii) such other form as may be agreed from time to time among the Issuer, the Dealer and the Issuing and Paying Agent contemplating a transaction substantially similar to that described in the form scheduled to the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement (the “Notes”).  

Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 6 hereof.  

The Addendum to this Agreement, and any Annexes or Exhibits described in this Agreement or such Addendum, are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and made fully a part hereof.  

 1. Offers, Sales and Resales of Notes.  

   1.1 While (i) the Issuer has and shall have no obligation to sell the Notes to the Dealer or to permit the Dealer to arrange any sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, and (ii) the Dealer has and shall have no obligation to purchase the Notes from the Issuer or to arrange any sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, the parties hereto agree that in any case where the Dealer purchases Notes from the Issuer, or arranges for the sale of Notes by the Issuer, such Notes will be purchased or sold by the Dealer in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Issuer contained herein or made pursuant hereto and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.  

   1.2 So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, and in addition to the limitations contained in Section 1.7 hereof, the Issuer shall not, without the consent of the Dealer, offer, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes except (a) in transactions with one or more dealers which may from time to time after the date hereof become dealers with respect to the Notes by executing with the Issuer one or more agreements which contain provisions substantially identical to those contained in Section 1 of this Agreement, of which the Issuer hereby undertakes to provide the Dealer prompt notice or (b) in transactions with the other dealers listed on the Addendum hereto, which are executing agreements with the Issuer which contain provisions substantially identical to Section 1 of this Agreement contemporaneously herewith. In no event shall the Issuer offer, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes directly on its own behalf in transactions with persons other than broker-dealers as specifically permitted in this Section 1.2.  

   1.3 The Notes shall be in a minimum denomination of $250,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, will bear such interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at such discount from their face amounts, as shall be agreed upon by the Dealer and the Issuer, shall have a maturity not exceeding 397 days from the date of issuance and may have such terms as are specified in Exhibit C hereto, the Private Placement Memorandum, a pricing supplement, or as otherwise agreed upon by the applicable purchaser and the Issuer. The Notes shall not contain any provision for extension, renewal or automatic “rollover.”  

   1.4  The authentication and issuance of, and payment for, the Notes shall be effected in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement, and the Notes shall be either individual  

1  

    physical certificates or book-entry notes evidenced by one or more master notes (each, a “Master Note”) registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee, in the form or forms annexed to the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement.  

   1.5 If the Issuer and the Dealer shall agree on the terms of the purchase of any Note by the Dealer or the sale of any Note arranged by the Dealer (including, but not limited to, agreement with respect to the date of issue, purchase price, principal amount, maturity and interest rate or interest rate index and margin (in the case of interest-bearing Notes) or discount thereof (in the case of Notes issued on a discount basis), and appropriate compensation for the Dealer’s services hereunder) pursuant to this Agreement, the Issuer shall cause such Note to be issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement and payment for such Note shall be made by the purchaser thereof, either directly or through the Dealer, to the Issuing and Paying Agent, for the account of the Issuer. Except as otherwise agreed, in the event that the Dealer is acting as an agent and a purchaser shall either fail to accept delivery of or make payment for a Note on the date fixed for settlement, the Dealer shall promptly notify the Issuer, and if the Dealer has theretofore paid the Issuer for the Note, the Issuer will promptly return such funds to the Dealer against its return of the Note to the Issuer, in the case of a certificated Note, and upon notice of such failure in the case of a book-entry Note.  

   1.6 The Dealer and the Issuer hereby establish and agree to observe the following procedures in connection with offers, sales and subsequent resales or other transfers of the Notes:  

   (a) Offers and sales of the Notes by or through the Dealer shall be made only to: (i) investors reasonably believed by the Dealer to be Qualified Institutional Buyers or Institutional Accredited Investors and (ii) non-bank fiduciaries or agents that will be purchasing Notes for one or more accounts, each of which is reasonably believed by the Dealer to be an Institutional Accredited Investor.  

   (b) Resales and other transfers of the Notes by the holders thereof shall be made only in accordance with the restrictions in the legend described in clause (e) below.  

   (c) No general solicitation or general advertising shall be used in connection with the offering of the Notes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the prior written approval of the Dealer, except as required by applicable securities laws, the Issuer shall not issue any press release, make any other statement to any member of the press making reference to the Notes, the offer or sale of the Notes or this Agreement or place or publish any “tombstone” or other advertisement, all to the extent relating to the Notes or the offer or sale of the Notes. To the extent permitted by applicable securities laws, the Issuer shall (i) omit the name of the Dealer from any publicly available filing by the Issuer that makes reference to the Notes, the offer or sale of the Notes or this Agreement, (ii) not include a copy of this Agreement in any such filing or as an exhibit thereto, and (iii) shall redact the Dealer’s name and any contact or other information that could identify the Dealer from any agreement or other information included in such filing. Nothing herein shall otherwise prohibit the mere factual confirmation by the Issuer of the issuance and existence of the Notes and the terms of the Notes, provided that such confirmation does not disclose any information other than that permitted under Rule 135c of the Securities Act.  

2  

   (d) No sale of Notes to any one purchaser shall be for less than $250,000 principal or face amount, and no Note shall be issued in a smaller principal or face amount. If the purchaser is a non-bank fiduciary acting on behalf of others, each person for whom such purchaser is acting must purchase at least $250,000 principal or face amount of Notes.  

   (e) Offers and sales of the Notes shall be subject to the restrictions described in the legend appearing on Exhibit A hereto. A legend substantially to the effect of such Exhibit A shall appear as part of the Private Placement Memorandum used in connection with offers and sales of Notes hereunder, as well as on each individual certificate representing a Note and each Master Note representing book-entry Notes offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement.  

   (f) The Dealer shall furnish or shall have furnished to each purchaser of Notes for which it has acted as the Dealer a copy of the then-current Private Placement Memorandum unless such purchaser has previously received a copy of the Private Placement Memorandum as then in effect. The Private Placement Memorandum shall expressly state that any person to whom Notes are offered shall have an opportunity to ask questions of, and receive information from, the Issuer and the Dealer and shall provide the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the persons from whom information regarding the Issuer may be obtained.  

   (g) The Issuer agrees, for the benefit of the Dealer and each of the holders and prospective purchasers from time to time of the Notes that, if at any time the Issuer shall not be subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer will furnish, upon request and at its expense, to the Dealer and to holders and prospective purchasers of Notes information required by Rule 144A(d)(4)(i) in compliance with Rule 144A(d).  

   (h) In the event that any Note offered or to be offered by the Dealer would be ineligible for resale under Rule 144A, the Issuer shall immediately notify the Dealer (by telephone, confirmed in writing) of such fact and shall promptly prepare and deliver to the Dealer an amendment or supplement to the Private Placement Memorandum describing the Notes that are ineligible, the reason for such ineligibility and any other relevant information relating thereto.  

   (i) The Issuer represents that it is not currently issuing commercial paper in the United States market in reliance upon the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act. The Issuer agrees that, if it shall issue commercial paper after the date hereof in reliance upon such exemption (a) the proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be segregated from the proceeds of the sale of any such commercial paper by being placed in a separate account; (b) the Issuer will institute appropriate corporate procedures to ensure that the offers and sales of notes issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Section 3(a)(3) exemption are not integrated with offerings and sales of Notes hereunder in a manner that would require the registration of offers and sales of the Notes under the Securities Act; and (c) the Issuer will comply with each of the requirements of Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act in selling commercial paper or other short-term debt securities other than the Notes in the United States.  

3  

 1.7 The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to the Dealer, in connection with offers, sales and resales of Notes, as follows:  

   (a) The Issuer hereby confirms to the Dealer that (except as permitted by Section 1.6(i)) within the preceding six months neither the Issuer nor any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof acting on behalf of the Issuer has offered or sold any Notes, or any substantially similar security of the Issuer (including, without limitation, medium-term notes issued by the Issuer), to, or solicited offers to buy any such security from, any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof other than to the extent that such offer, sale or solicitation would not adversely affect the entitlement of the Notes to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Issuer also agrees that (except as permitted by Section 1.6(i)), as long as the Notes are being offered for sale by the Dealer and the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof as contemplated hereby and until at least six months after the offer of Notes hereunder has been terminated, neither the Issuer nor any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof (except as contemplated by Section 1.2 hereof) acting on behalf of the Issuer will offer the Notes or any substantially similar security of the Issuer for sale to, or solicit offers to buy any such security from, any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof, other than to the extent that such offer or solicitation would not adversely affect the entitlement of the Notes to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The Issuer hereby represents and warrants that it has not taken or omitted to take, and will not take or omit to take, any action that would cause the offering and sale of Notes hereunder to be integrated with any other offering of securities in a manner that would require the registration of offers and sales of the Notes under the Securities Act, whether such offering is made by the Issuer or some other party or parties.  

   (b) The Issuer represents and agrees that the proceeds of the sale of the Notes are not currently contemplated to be used for the purpose of buying, carrying or trading securities within the meaning of Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In the event that the Issuer determines to use such proceeds for the purpose of buying, carrying or trading securities, whether in connection with an acquisition of another company or otherwise, the Issuer shall give the Dealer at least five business days’ prior written notice to that effect. The Issuer shall also give the Dealer prompt notice of the actual date that it commences to purchase securities with the proceeds of the Notes. Thereafter, in the event that the Dealer purchases Notes as principal and does not resell such Notes on the day of such purchase, to the extent necessary to comply with Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder, the Dealer will sell such Notes either (i) only to offerees it reasonably believes to be Qualified Institutional Buyers or to Qualified Institutional Buyers it reasonably believes are acting for other Qualified Institutional Buyers, in each case in accordance with Rule 144A or (ii) in a manner which would not cause a violation of Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder.

   3.2 The Issuer shall give the Dealer prompt notice whenever there shall occur any change in the Issuer’s condition (financial or otherwise) or operations or any development or occurrence in relation to the Issuer that would be material and adverse to holders of the Notes or potential holders of the Notes (to the extent not otherwise publicly disclosed), including upon the Issuer becoming aware that the Issuer’s short term rating has been listed on “CreditWatch” by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, a Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies Inc., or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or such rating agency has announced the such rating is under formal review for downgrade, provided that the Issuer shall not be required to disclose any information that would be legally impermissible or that is material non-public information.

The Private Placement Memorandum shall contain a statement expressly offering an opportunity for each prospective purchaser to ask questions of, and receive answers from, the Issuer concerning the offering of Notes and to obtain relevant additional information which the Issuer possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense.  

   4.2 The Issuer agrees to promptly furnish the Dealer the Company Information as it becomes available, provided that the Issuer shall be deemed to have furnished any such Company Information to the extent that it has been publicly filed with the SEC.  

   4.3 (a) The Issuer agrees to notify the Dealer promptly upon it becoming aware of the occurrence of any event relating to or affecting the Issuer that would cause the Company Information then in existence to include an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.  

(b) In the event that the Issuer gives the Dealer notice pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and (i) the Issuer is selling Notes in accordance with Section 1, (ii) the Dealer notifies the Issuer that it then has Notes it is holding in inventory, or (iii) any Notes are otherwise outstanding, the Issuer agrees promptly to supplement or amend the Private Placement Memorandum so that the Private Placement Memorandum, as amended or supplemented, shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the Issuer shall make such supplement or amendment available to the Dealer.

(c) In the event that (i) the Issuer gives the Dealer notice pursuant to Section 4.3(a), (ii) (A) the Issuer is not selling Notes in accordance with Section 1, (B) the Dealer does not notify the Issuer that it is then holding Notes in inventory and (C) no Notes are otherwise outstanding, and (iii) the Issuer chooses not to promptly amend or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum in the manner described in clause (b) above, then all solicitations and sales of Notes shall be suspended until such time as the Issuer has so amended or supplemented the Private Placement Memorandum, and made such amendment or supplement available to the Dealer.  

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.3(a), to the extent that the Private Placement Memorandum sets forth financial information of the Issuer (other than financial information included in a report described in clause (i) of the definition of “Company Information” that (i) is incorporated by reference in the Private Placement Memorandum or (ii) the Private Placement Memorandum expressly states is being made available to holders and prospective purchasers of the Notes but is not otherwise set forth therein), the Issuer shall review, amend and supplement the Private Placement Memorandum on a periodic basis, but no less than at least once annually, to incorporate current financial information of the Issuer to the extent necessary to ensure that the information provided in the Private Placement Memorandum is accurate and complete.  

 5. Indemnification and Contribution.  

   5.1 The Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Dealer, each individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association or other entity controlling the Dealer, any affiliate of the Dealer or any such controlling entity and their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, incorporators, shareholders (other than any shareholder of ), servants, trustees and agents (hereinafter the “Indemnitees”) against any and all liabilities, penalties, suits, causes of action, losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) or judgments of whatever kind or nature (each a “Claim”), imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnitees arising out of or based upon (i) any allegation that the Private Placement Memorandum, the Company Information or any information provided by the Issuer to the Dealer included (as of any relevant time) or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted (as of any relevant time) or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (ii) the breach by the Issuer of any agreement, covenant or representation made in or pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) the failure by the Issuer to make due payment under the Notes. This indemnification shall not apply (i) to the extent that the Claim arises out of or is based upon Dealer Information or (ii) in the case of a Claim under clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent the Claim is judicially determined to have result from the Dealer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  

   5.2 Provisions relating to claims made for indemnification under this Section 5 are set forth on Exhibit B to this Agreement.  

10  

   5.3 In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is held to be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless the Indemnitees, although applicable in accordance with the terms of this Section 5, the Issuer shall contribute to the aggregate costs incurred by the Dealer in connection with any Claim in the proportion of the respective economic interests of the Issuer and the Dealer; provided, however, that such contribution by the Issuer shall be in an amount such that the aggregate costs incurred by the Dealer do not exceed the aggregate of the commissions and fees earned by the Dealer hereunder with respect to the issue or issues of Notes to which such Claim relates. The respective economic interests shall be calculated by reference to the aggregate proceeds to the Issuer of the Notes issued hereunder and the aggregate commissions and fees earned by the Dealer hereunder.

Exhibit B  

Further Provisions Relating to Indemnification  

 (a) The Issuer agrees to reimburse each Indemnitee for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of external counsel) as they are incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect of which indemnification may be sought under Section 5 of the Agreement (whether or not it is a party to any such proceedings).  

 (b) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the existence of a Claim, such Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Issuer, notify the Issuer in writing of the existence thereof; provided that (i) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve the Issuer from any liability which it may have hereunder unless and except to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such Claim and such failure results in the forfeiture by the Issuer of substantial rights and defenses, and (ii) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve it from liability which it may have to an Indemnitee otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In case any such Claim is made against any Indemnitee and it notifies the Issuer of the existence thereof, the Issuer will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the Indemnitee, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee; provided that if the defendants in any such Claim include both the Indemnitee and the Issuer, and the Indemnitee shall have concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Issuer, the Issuer shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Claim on behalf of such Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses on behalf of such Indemnitee. Upon receipt of notice from the Issuer to such Indemnitee of the Issuer’s election so to assume the defense of such Claim and approval by the Indemnitee of counsel, the Issuer will not be liable to such Indemnitee for expenses incurred thereafter by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs of investigation) unless (i) the Indemnitee shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel in the jurisdiction in which any Claim is brought), approved by the Dealer, representing the Indemnitee who is party to such Claim), (ii) the Issuer shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee to represent the Indemnitee within a reasonable time after notice of existence of the Claim or (iii) the Issuer has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the Indemnitee. The indemnity, reimbursement and contribution obligations of the Issuer hereunder shall be in addition to any other liability the Issuer may otherwise have to an Indemnitee and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the Issuer and any Indemnitee. The Issuer agrees that without the Dealer’s prior written consent, it will not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought under the indemnification provision of the Agreement (whether or not the Dealer or any other Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such Claim), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnitee.  

Exhibit C  

Statement of Terms for Interest – Bearing Commercial Paper Notes of ERP Operating Limited Partnership  

THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE QUALIFIED TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE BY THE TRANSACTION SPECIFIC PRICING OR PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM SUPPLEMENT (THE “SUPPLEMENT”) (IF ANY) SENT TO EACH PURCHASER AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.  

1. General. (a) The obligations of the Issuer to which these terms apply (each a “Note”) are represented by one or more Master Notes (each, a “Master Note”) issued in the name of (or of a nominee for) The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), which Master Note includes the terms and provisions for the Issuer’s Interest-Bearing Commercial Paper Notes that are set forth in this Statement of Terms, since this Statement of Terms constitutes an integral part of the Underlying Records as defined and referred to in the Master Note.  

(b) “Business Day” means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, executive order or regulation to be closed in New York City and, with respect to LIBOR Notes (as defined below) is also a London Business Day. “London Business Day” means, a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.  

2. Interest. (a) Each Note will bear interest at a fixed rate (a “Fixed Rate Note”) or at a floating rate (a “Floating Rate Note”).  

(b) The Supplement sent to each holder of such Note will describe the following terms: (i) whether such Note is a Fixed Rate Note or a Floating Rate Note and whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount Note (as defined below); (ii) the date on which such Note will be issued (the “Issue Date”); (iii) the Stated Maturity Date (as defined below); (iv) if such Note is a Fixed Rate Note, the rate per annum at which such Note will bear interest, if any, and the Interest Payment Dates; (v) if such Note is a Floating Rate Note, the Base Rate, the Index Maturity, the Interest Reset Dates, the Interest Payment Dates and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any (all as defined below), and any other terms relating to the particular method of calculating the interest rate for such Note; and (vi) any other terms applicable specifically to such Note. “Original Issue Discount Note” means a Note which has a stated redemption price at the Stated Maturity Date that exceeds its Issue Price by more than a specified de minimis amount and which the Supplement indicates will be an “Original Issue Discount Note”.  

(c) Each Fixed Rate Note will bear interest from its Issue Date at the rate per annum specified in the Supplement until the principal amount thereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest on each Fixed Rate Note will be payable on the dates specified in the Supplement (each an “Interest Payment Date” for a Fixed Rate Note) and on the Maturity Date (as defined below). Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  

If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date of a Fixed Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest will be payable on the next succeeding Business Day, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of the payment made on that next succeeding Business Day.  

(d) The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest Reset Period (as defined below) will be determined by reference to an interest rate basis (a “Base Rate”) plus or minus a number of basis points (one basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point) (the “Spread”), if any, and/or multiplied by a certain percentage (the “Spread Multiplier”), if any, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. The Supplement will designate which of the following Base Rates is applicable to the related Floating Rate Note: (a) the CD Rate (a “CD Rate Note”), (b) the Commercial Paper Rate (a “Commercial Paper Rate Note”), (c) the Federal Funds Rate (a “Federal Funds Rate Note”), (d) LIBOR (a “LIBOR Note”), (e) the Prime Rate (a “Prime Rate Note”), (f) the Treasury Rate (a “Treasury Rate Note”) or (g) such other Base Rate as may be specified in such Supplement.  

The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or semi-annually (the “Interest Reset Period”). The date or dates on which interest will be reset (each an “Interest Reset Date”) will be, unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, in the case of Floating Rate Notes which reset daily, each Business Day, in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) that reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Treasury Rate Notes that reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset semiannually, the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement. If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on each Floating Rate Note will be payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually (the “Interest Payment Period”) and on the Maturity Date. Unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, and except as provided below, the date or dates on which interest will be payable (each an “Interest Payment Date” for a Floating Rate Note) will be, in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a monthly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a quarterly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a semiannual Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement. In addition, the Maturity Date will also be an Interest Payment Date.  

If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note (other than an Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such maturity.  

Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes will include accrued interest from and including the Issue Date or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid, as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date. On the Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date. Accrued interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a Floating  

2  

 Rate Note by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the cases where the Base Rate is the CD Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate, or by the actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate. The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to any adjustment by a Spread and/or a Spread Multiplier.  

The “Interest Determination Date” where the Base Rate is the CD Rate or the Commercial Paper Rate will be the second Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be the Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is LIBOR will be the second London Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned. Treasury Bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is held on the following Tuesday or the preceding Friday. If an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week.  

The “Index Maturity” is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation from which the applicable Base Rate is calculated.  

The “Calculation Date,” where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day following the applicable Interest Determination Date or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date.  

All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless otherwise specified.  

The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent which party will be the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”) with respect to the Floating Rate Notes. The Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note to the Issuing and Paying Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in such interest rate.  

All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards. For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of U.S. dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).  

3  

CD Rate Notes  

“CD Rate” means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”) in “Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates” or any successor publication of the FRB (“H.15(519)”) under the heading “CDs (Secondary Market)”.  

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the world wide website of the FRB at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Update, or any successor site or publication or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate (“H.15 Daily Update”) under the caption “CDs (Secondary Market)”.  

If such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity in the denomination of $5,000,000.  

If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.  

Commercial Paper Rate Notes  

“Commercial Paper Rate” means the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on any Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519) under the heading “Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial”.  

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on such Interest Determination Date for commercial paper of the Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading “Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial”.  

If by 3:00 p.m. on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of the Index Maturity placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is “AA,” or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  

If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Interest Determination Date will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.  

4  

“Money Market Yield” will be a yield calculated in accordance with the following formula:  

 Money Market Yield =    

D × 360 

     × 100 

360 – (D x M)    

where “D” refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and “M” refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which interest is being calculated.  

Federal Funds Rate Notes  

“Federal Funds Rate” means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for federal funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading “Federal Funds (Effective)” and displayed on Reuters Page (as defined below) FEDFUNDS1 (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service) (“Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1”) under the heading EFFECT.  

If the above rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1or is not so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading “Federal Funds/(Effective)”.  

If such rate is not published as described above by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight U.S. dollar federal funds arranged by each of three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date.  

If the brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate will remain the Federal Funds Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.  

“Reuters Page” means the display on the Reuters 3000 Xtra Service, or any successor service, on the page or pages specified in this Statement of Terms or the Supplement, or any replacement page on that service.  

LIBOR Notes  

The London Interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date, the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.  

If no rate appears, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in such market selected by the Calculation Agent for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in principal amount equal to an amount that in the Calculation Agent’s judgment is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in such market at such time (a “Representative Amount”). The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such interest period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates

 quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in New York City, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in a Representative Amount; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are providing such quotations, the then existing LIBOR rate will remain in effect for such Interest Payment Period.  

“Designated LIBOR Page” means the display on the Reuters 3000 Xtra Service (or any successor service) on the “LIBOR01” page (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks.  

Prime Rate Notes  

“Prime Rate” means the rate on any Interest Determination Date as published in H.15(519) under the heading “Bank Prime Loan”.  

If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update opposite the caption “Bank Prime Loan”.  

If the rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page (as defined below) as such bank’s prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., on that Interest Determination Date.  

If fewer than four such rates referred to above are so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent.  

If the banks selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime Rate will remain the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest Determination Date.  

“Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page” means the display designated as page “US PRIME1” on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the US PRIME1 page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks).
