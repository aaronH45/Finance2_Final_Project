(a)On February 18, 2015, Kimberly-Clark Corporation (the “Corporation”) announced that Maria Henry, age 48, has been elected Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation, effective April 27, 2015. On that date, the current Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark A. Buthman, will assume the title of Executive Vice President to serve during a management transition period until he begins retirement at the end of 2015. 

Ms. Henry served as Chief Financial Officer of The Hillshire Brands Company from June 2012 until that company’s merger with Tyson Foods, Inc. in August 2014, and Chief Financial Officer of Sara Lee Corporation’s North American Retail and Food Service business from July 2011 to June 2012. Before joining Sara Lee, Ms. Henry served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Culligan International, which manufactures water treatment products, from October 2005 to June 2011.

Ms. Henry’s initial base salary will be $750,000 per year. As a participant in the Corporation’s annual incentive plan, Ms. Henry will be eligible for an annual bonus, based on individual and company performance. Her target bonus under the plan has been set at 90% of her base salary and for 2015 she will be eligible for a full-year bonus. Ms. Henry will be eligible for annual stock-based incentives. She will also participate in the Corporation’s supplemental 401(k) plan, executive severance plan and other benefit plans available to the Corporation’s executive officers and employees, as described in the Corporation’s Definitive Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 1, 2014. In addition to certain severance protection under those plans, if Ms. Henry is involuntarily terminated without cause or resigns for good reason during her first year of employment, she would receive a severance payment equal to the sum of one year’s salary and her target annual bonus.
