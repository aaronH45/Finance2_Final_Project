(1) Global Payments adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606") on January 1, 2018. The new accounting standard changed the presentation of certain amounts that we pay to third parties, including payment networks. This change in presentation affected our reported GAAP revenues and operating expenses by the same amount and had no effect on operating income. Also, ASC 606 changed the presentation of revenue for our gaming cash advance solutions and had a de minimis impact on revenue from our European business. For our gaming cash advance solutions, certain amounts we previously presented as operating expenses are now recognized as a reduction of revenue under GAAP. As a result of adopting ASC 606, results for 2018 and 2017 revenues and operating expenses are not comparable, thus the changes from the prior year are not meaningful.

OUTLOOK SUMMARY (UNAUDITED) 

GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

(In billions, except per share data) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Represents adjustments to revenues for gross-up related payments (included in operating expenses) associated with certain lines of business to reflect economic benefit to the company. Amounts also include adjustments to eliminate the effect of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments for software-related contract liabilities associated with acquired businesses.

(2) Adjustments to 2018 GAAP diluted EPS include software-related contract liability adjustments described above of $0.06, acquisition related amortization expense of $1.85, share-based compensation expense of $0.28, acquisition and integration expense of $0.28, employee termination benefits of $0.01, asset abandonment charges associated with technology integrations of $0.04 and the removal of a income tax benefit of $0.17 associated with tax reform. Also, adjustments to 2018 GAAP diluted EPS includes the effect of these adjustments on noncontrolling interests and income taxes, as applicable. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Global Payments supplements revenues, income, operating income and EPS information determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP by providing these measures, and other measures, with certain adjustments (such measures being non-GAAP financial measures) in this document to assist with evaluating our performance. In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to focus on the factors the company believes are pertinent to the daily management of our operations. Management believes adjusted net revenue and adjusted net revenue plus network fees more closely reflect the economic benefits to the company's core business and, in the case of adjusted net revenue, allows for better comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, together with other metrics, to set goals for and measure the performance of the business and to determine incentive compensation. Adjusted net revenue, adjusted net revenue plus network fees, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, revenues, operating income, net income and EPS determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Adjusted net revenue excludes gross-up related payments associated with certain lines of business to reflect economic benefits to the company. On a GAAP basis, these payments are presented gross in both revenues and operating expenses. Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude acquisition-related amortization expense, share-based compensation and certain other items specific to each reporting period as more fully described in the accompanying reconciliations in Schedules 6, 7, 8 and 9. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenue plus network fees. The tax rate used in determining the net income impact of earnings adjustments is either the jurisdictional statutory rate in effect at the time of the adjustment or the jurisdictional expected annual effective tax rate for the period, depending on the nature and timing of the adjustment.
