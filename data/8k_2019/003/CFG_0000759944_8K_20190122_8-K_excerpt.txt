Fourth Quarter 2018 vs. Third Quarter 2018  

Key Highlights  

   •    

Fourth quarter highlights include ROTCE of 13.8% and Underlying ROTCE* of 14.1%. Underlying results excluding the impact of notable items and Franklin American Mortgage Company (“FAMC”)* reflect revenue growth of 2%, driven by strength in noninterest income and net interest income given average loan growth of 2% and a three basis point improvement in net interest margin.  

   •    

Fourth quarter 2018 results reflect a net $9 million after-tax reduction, or ($0.02) per fully diluted share, from notable items compared with a net $7 million after-tax reduction, or ($0.02) per share, in third quarter 2018.  

   •    

Results reflect an efficiency ratio of 59.7%, which includes the impact of $45 million of notable expense items and a 93 basis point impact tied to the FAMC acquisition. Excluding the impact of notable items and FAMC, the Underlying efficiency ratio* improved by 118 basis points to 55.8% given strong expense discipline with positive operating leverage of 2.1%.  

   •    

Tangible book value per common share of $28.73 increased by 4%. Fully diluted average common shares outstanding decreased by 8.5 million shares.  

Results  

   •    

Total revenue of $1.6 billion increased 2%, reflecting strength in noninterest income and net interest income.

Net interest income of $1.2 billion increased $24 million, reflecting 2% average loan growth and a three basis point improvement in net interest margin to 3.22% from third quarter levels.  

   •    

Net interest margin of 3.22% reflects improved yields on interest-earning assets, including the benefit of higher short-term interest rates and balance sheet optimization, partially offset by higher funding costs.  

   •    

Noninterest income of $421 million increased $5 million. Excluding the impact of notable items and FAMC,* noninterest income of $393 million remained relatively stable, as strength in foreign exchange and interest rate products and letter of credit and loan fees was largely offset by a reduction in mortgage banking and capital markets fees.  

   •    

Noninterest expense of $951 million increased $41 million driven by a $46 million increase tied to the FAMC acquisition and notable items. Excluding the impact of notable items and FAMC,* noninterest expense of $871 million decreased by $5 million as a reduction in other operating expense, largely tied to a reduction in FDIC insurance expense, and lower occupancy expense were partially offset by seasonally higher outside services and an increase in salaries and employee benefits tied to growth initiatives.  

   •    

Provision for credit losses of $85 million increased modestly from relatively low third quarter levels.  

   •    

Preferred dividends increased $8 million reflecting the impact of second and fourth quarter issuances.

   •    

Net charge-offs of 29 basis points were stable with third quarter levels.  

   •    

Capital strength remains robust, with a preliminary common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) risk-based capital ratio of 10.6%.

Excluding the impact of notable items and FAMC,* noninterest income increased 2% as strength in card fees, letter of credit and loan fees and capital markets fees was partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking fees, and other income.  

   •    

Noninterest expense increased 6% from fourth quarter 2017 driven by the $40 million impact of the FAMC acquisition and notable items. Excluding the impact of notable items and FAMC,* noninterest expense increased 2%, driven by a $24 million increase in salaries and employee benefits tied to the impact of our strategic growth initiatives and an increase in amortization of software and equipment and outside services expense. These increases were partially offset by lower other operating expense, largely due to lower FDIC insurance and pension costs, as well as lower occupancy expense.

Discussion of results:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth quarter 2018 net interest income of $1.2 billion increased $24 million, or 2%, from third quarter 2018, given a 2% increase in average loans and loans held for sale and a three basis point improvement in net interest margin to 3.22%. The improvement in net interest margin reflects higher loan yields tied to higher rates, partially offset by increased deposit and funding costs.  

Compared with fourth quarter 2017, net interest income increased $92 million, or 9%, driven by 5% average loan growth and a 14 basis point improvement in net interest margin. The improvement in net interest margin reflects higher interest-earning asset yields given higher rates and continued mix shift towards higher-yielding assets, partially offset by higher deposit and funding costs. Net interest margin, excluding the impact of FAMC,* improved 15 basis points to 3.23%.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

1) Other income includes bank-owned life insurance and other income.  

Noninterest income of $421 million increased $5 million, or 1%, from third quarter 2018, driven by the $9 million impact of the FAMC acquisition largely in mortgage banking fees. Underlying noninterest income, excluding the impact of FAMC,* remained relatively stable as strength in foreign exchange and interest rate products and letter of credit and loan fees was largely offset

 by a reduction in mortgage banking and capital markets fees tied to overall market conditions. Securities gains of $6 million were partially offset by a $2 million net loss in foreign exchange and interest rate products tied to credit valuation adjustments, related to interest rate moves during fourth quarter 2018.  

Compared to fourth quarter 2017, noninterest income increased $17 million, or 4%, including a $33 million impact of the FAMC acquisition. Underlying noninterest income, excluding the impact of FAMC,* increased $6 million, or 2%, driven by strength in card fees, letter of credit and loan fees, capital markets fees and foreign exchange and interest rate products. These increases were partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees and other income, reflecting a reduction in leasing income.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest expense of $951 million increased $41 million, or 5%, from third quarter 2018, driven by the $46 million increase tied to the FAMC acquisition and notable items, largely in salaries and employee benefits. Underlying noninterest expense, excluding the impact of FAMC,* of $871 million decreased by $5 million, as a reduction in other operating expense, tied largely to a reduction in FDIC insurance expense, and lower occupancy expense were partially offset by seasonally higher outside services and an increase in salaries and employee benefits tied to growth initiatives. Results reflect continued focus on expense discipline and the benefit of TOP efficiency initiatives.  

Compared with fourth quarter 2017, noninterest expense increased $53 million, or 6%, driven by the impact of the FAMC acquisition and notable items. Underlying noninterest expense, excluding the impact of FAMC,* increased $13 million, or 2%, largely reflecting a $24 million increase in salaries and employee benefits tied to the impact of our strategic growth initiatives, as well as an increase in amortization of software and equipment and outside services expense. These increases were partially offset by lower other expense, largely tied to a reduction in FDIC insurance and pension costs, as well as lower occupancy expense.  

The fourth quarter 2018 effective tax rate of 16.5%, including the impact of notable items tied to the true-up of December 2017 Tax Legislation, decreased from 23.2% for third quarter 2018 and increased from (32.4)% for fourth quarter 2017.

Compared with fourth quarter 2017, net charge-offs increased $7 million, reflecting a $6 million increase in commercial net charge-offs, and relatively stable results in retail as the impact of expected seasoning in unsecured portfolios was offset by improvement in auto. Fourth quarter 2018 net charge-offs of 29 basis points of average loans and leases compares with 30 basis points in third quarter 2018 and 28 basis points in fourth quarter 2017.  

Allowance for loan and lease losses of $1.2 billion is stable compared with third quarter 2018 and fourth quarter 2017 levels, reflecting strong overall credit quality that helped offset reserves to fund year-over-year loan growth.  

The ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was 1.06% as of December 31, 2018, which was stable compared with 1.08% as of September 30, 2018 and down modestly from 1.12% as of December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans and leases ratio of 156% as of December 31, 2018 compares to 149% as of September 30, 2018, and 142% as of December 31, 2017, reflecting the decrease in nonperforming loans.

Key Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations  

(in millions, except share, per-share and ratio data)  

Key Performance Metrics:  

Our Management uses certain key performance metrics (KPMs) to gauge our progress against strategic and operational goals, as well as to compare our performance against peers. The KPMs are referred to in our Registration Statements on Form S-1 and our external financial reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The KPMs include:  

   •    

Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE);  

   •    

Return on average total tangible assets (ROTA);  

   •    

Efficiency ratio;  

   •    

Operating leverage; and  

   •    

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio.  

Established targets for the KPMs are based on Management-reporting results which are currently referred to by the Company as “Underlying” results. In historical periods, these results may have been referred to as “Adjusted” or “Adjusted/Underlying” results. We believe that Underlying results, which exclude notable items, provide the best representation of our underlying financial progress toward the KPMs as the results exclude items that our Management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We have consistently shown investors our KPMs on a Management-reporting basis since our initial public offering in September of 2014. KPMs that reflect Underlying results are considered non-GAAP financial measures.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:  

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as Underlying results. In historical periods, these results may have been referred to as Adjusted or Adjusted/Underlying results. Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which Management does not consider indicative of the Company’s on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by our Management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results. The following tables present reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements  

This document contains forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “targets,” “initiatives,” “potentially,” “probably,” “projects,” “outlook” or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and “could.”  

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ, materially, from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation:  

   •    

negative economic conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of nonperforming assets, charge-offs and provision expense;  

   •    

the rate of growth in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions;  

   •    

our ability to implement our strategic plan, including the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our indicative performance targets;  

   •    

our ability to remedy regulatory deficiencies and meet supervisory requirements and expectations;  

   •    

liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations;  

   •    

our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;  

   •    

the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale;  

   •    

changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets;  

   •    

the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;  

   •    

financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services;  

   •    

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks; and management’s ability to identify and manage these and other risks.  

25  

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or share repurchases will depend on our financial condition, earnings, cash needs, regulatory constraints, capital requirements (including requirements of our subsidiaries), and any other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends.  

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2018.
