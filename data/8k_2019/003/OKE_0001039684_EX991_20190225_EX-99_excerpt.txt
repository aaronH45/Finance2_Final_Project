Spencer, ONEOK president and chief executive officer. “We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and the financial capability to fund these projects with no expected equity needs in 2019. “As we look ahead, 2019 will be a year of project execution, positioning ONEOK for strong earnings growth in 2020,” added Spencer. “With continued production improvements and a large inventory of flared natural gas in the Williston Basin, we expect to immediately benefit from the completion of the Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant, which we anticipate will start operations nearly full in the fourth quarter 2019. We expect volume to reach approximately 100,000 bpd on our Elk Creek Pipeline in the first quarter of 2020 from Demicks Lake I, third-party processing plants and NGLs currently being railed from the basin. “The projects we’re placing in service this year and in early 2020 will provide much needed natural gas processing and NGL takeaway capacity, and are expected to drive volume and earnings growth,” said Spencer. -more-  

 ONEOK Announces 32 Percent Increase in 2018 Operating Income; Announces 2019 Financial Guidance and 2020 Outlook Feb. 25, 2019 Page 3 FOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ONEOK’s operating income increased 18 percent in the fourth quarter 2018 and 32 percent for the full-year 2018, compared with the same periods in 2017. Higher 2018 results were driven primarily by natural gas and natural gas liquids volume growth across its operations, and higher optimization and marketing earnings in the natural gas liquids segment. Results were offset partially by higher employee-related costs in all three segments, higher operating costs associated with the growth of ONEOK’s operations in the natural gas gathering and processing segment and routine maintenance projects in the natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines segments. HIGHLIGHTS: • Paying in February 2019 a quarterly dividend of 86 cents per share, or $3.44 per share on an annualized basis, an increase of 12 percent compared with the same quarter in 2018; • DCF in excess of dividends paid of $487.3 million for 2018; • Debt-to-EBITDA ratio on an annualized run-rate basis of 3.75 times as of Dec. 31, 2018; • Increasing total debt only $200 million in 2018, compared with Dec. 31, 2017, while capital expenditures totaled more than $2 billion during the year; • Having $2.5 billion available under its credit agreement and $950 million available on its three-year unsecured term loan agreement, totaling $3.5 billion of borrowing capacity combined as of Dec. 31, 2018; and • Recent capital-growth project completions totaling approximately $500 million, including: ◦ 60,000 barrel per day (bpd) Sterling III NGL Pipeline expansion in the Mid- Continent; ◦ 110,000 bpd West Texas LPG pipeline extension into the Delaware Basin; ◦ 200 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) Canadian Valley natural gas processing plant expansion in the STACK; ◦ 100 MMcf/d westbound expansion of ONEOK Gas Transportation (OGT) from the STACK; ◦ Roadrunner Gas Transmission (Roadrunner) bidirectional project, resulting in approximately 1 Bcf/d of eastbound transportation capacity from the Delaware Basin to the Waha area; and ◦ 300 MMcf/d ONEOK WesTex Transmission expansion from the Permian Basin. -more-

 ONEOK Announces 32 Percent Increase in 2018 Operating Income; Announces 2019 Financial Guidance and 2020 Outlook Feb. 25, 2019 Page 5 2019 Performance Drivers: Natural Gas Liquids • 11 percent increase in natural gas liquids raw feed throughput volumes expected to be driven by the completion of the southern leg of Elk Creek Pipeline in the third quarter 2019, a full year of operations of the Sterling III Pipeline expansion and the West Texas LPG pipeline extension completed in 2018, and continued volume growth from new third-party plant connections and expansions completed in 2018. • Expect four to six new third-party natural gas processing plant connections, the expansion of five existing third-party plants, and connection with ONEOK’s Demicks Lake I plant. • Earnings expected to be more than 80 percent fee based. Natural Gas Gathering and Processing • 5 percent increase in natural gas volumes processed expected to be driven primarily by ONEOK’s Williston Basin natural gas processing plants operating at full capacity, and an additional 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity when Demicks Lake I is completed in the fourth quarter. • Average fee rate expected to range from 90 to 95 cents per Million British thermal units (MMBtu), compared with 90 cents per MMBtu in 2018. • Earnings expected to be approximately 85 percent fee based. Natural Gas Pipelines • Earnings growth expected to be driven by recently completed capital-growth projects including the OGT and WesTex Transmission expansions, and the Roadrunner bidirectional project. • Earnings expected to be more than 95 percent fee-based. Additional guidance information can be found in the tables on page 20 and in supplemental materials found on ONEOK’s website, www.oneok.com. 2020 OUTLOOK: ONEOK expects a greater than 20 percent increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2020, compared with 2019. More than $4.4 billion of capital-growth projects expected to be completed in 2019 and in the first quarter 2020 will provide a foundation for significant earnings growth in 2020. ONEOK continues to contract additional volumes on these projects with construction underway, on time and on budget. Primary contributors to 2020 earnings growth are expected to include a faster than anticipated volume ramp on ONEOK’s Elk Creek Pipeline, its Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant beginning operations nearly full in the fourth quarter 2019 and its MB-4 NGL -more-

Elk Creek Pipeline is expected to reach its initial contracted capacity of 100,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2020, generating its targeted adjusted EBITDA multiple of four to six times within its first few months of operation. Elk Creek volumes are expected to continue to increase throughout 2020. Additionally, ONEOK expects to benefit from higher producer activity in the Powder River Basin, volume growth in the Permian Basin, increased rates on the West Texas LPG Pipeline system and the completion of the Arbuckle II NGL pipeline, which will provide additional connectivity with Gulf Coast markets. 2018 BUSINESS-SEGMENT RESULTS: Key financial and operating statistics are listed on page 18 in the tables. Natural Gas Liquids Segment The natural gas liquids segment’s fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased 12 and 25 percent, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2017. Higher volumes in the STACK and SCOOP areas, and the Williston and Permian basins, and higher earnings from optimization and marketing activities contributed to the increases. NGL volumes gathered during the fourth quarter and full year 2018 increased 8 and 12 percent, respectively, compared with 2017. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 NGLs fractionated increased 9 and 15 percent respectively, compared with the same periods in 2017, due primarily to higher volumes gathered and an expansion of ONEOK’s Mid-Continent fractionation capacity. Ethane volumes across ONEOK’s system increased approximately 65,000 bpd in 2018, compared with 2017, due to supply growth, increased NGL export demand and petrochemical facility expansion projects. ONEOK expects ethane production levels across its system to continue to fluctuate until the completion of its announced NGL pipeline and fractionation capital-growth projects, which are expected to help alleviate current system constraints.

These non-GAAP financial measures described above are useful to investors because they, and similar measures, are used by many companies in the industry as a measure of financial performance and are commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare our financial performance with the performance of other companies within our industry. Adjusted EBITDA, ONEOK distributable cash flow and dividend coverage ratio should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and coverage ratio are included in the tables. -more-
