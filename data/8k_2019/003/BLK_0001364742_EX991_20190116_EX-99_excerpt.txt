SUMMARY OF REVENUE  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

*  

Results for 2017 were recast to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on March 22, 2018.  

Highlights  

▪  

Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue decreased $118 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 and $104 million from the third quarter of 2018, despite the positive impact of organic growth and AUM acquired in the TCP and Citibanamex transactions. The decrease was driven by the impact of lower markets, previously announced pricing changes to select investment products and lower borrowing demand for securities lending in the current environment. Securities lending revenue of $129 million in the current quarter compared with $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $160 million in the third quarter of 2018. 

▪  

Performance fees decreased $185 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternative and long-only products and decreased $51 million from the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to strong performance from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ends in the third quarter. 

▪  

Technology services revenue increased $27 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3 million from the third quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting higher revenue from institutional Aladdin®.

▪  

Direct fund expense decreased $13 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 and $25 million from the third quarter of 2018, reflecting lower average AUM. 

▪  

General and administration expense decreased $1 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, despite $31 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions in the current quarter. 

General and administration expense increased $36 million from the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to seasonally higher marketing and promotional expense. 

▪  

A restructuring charge of $60 million, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with an initiative to modify the size and shape of the workforce.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (unaudited)  

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.  

Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.  

10 

Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:  

(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.  

▪  

Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. A restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value.  

▪  

Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.   

Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to third parties. Management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the Company’s products. BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to distribution and servicing costs as a proxy for such offsetting revenue.  

(2) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.  

See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation and restructuring charge.  

For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the restructuring charge and PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. The fourth quarter and full year of 2017 noncash deferred tax revaluation benefit of $1,758 million and the other income tax matters were primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. A deemed repatriation tax expense of $477 million has been excluded from the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 as adjusted results due to the one-time nature and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 

Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 

(3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
