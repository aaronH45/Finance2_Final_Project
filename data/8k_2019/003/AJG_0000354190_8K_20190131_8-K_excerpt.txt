The Company plans to close an offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount senior unsecured notes (fixed rate) in mid-February 2019, with two funding dates, $340 million at closing and $260 million in March 2019. The weighted average maturity of the notes is 10.1 years and their weighted average interest rate is 5.06% after giving effect to underwriting, legal and hedging costs. The Company plans to use the proceeds of these offerings to repay certain existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including to fund acquisitions expected to close in first quarter 2019.  

These notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This disclosure shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the notes.  

This disclosure contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, relating to the Company’s anticipated closing of senior unsecured notes. Important factors that could impact these forward-looking statements include changes in worldwide and national economic conditions, changes in premium rates and in insurance markets generally, changes in the insurance brokerage industry’s competitive landscape, changes in the interest rate environment, changes in the attractiveness of the Company’s private placement notes to investors, and unexpected financial challenges or strategic opportunities.
