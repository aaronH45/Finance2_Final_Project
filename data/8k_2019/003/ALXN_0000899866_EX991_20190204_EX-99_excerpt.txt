BOSTON, February 4, 2019- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018. Total revenues for the full year of 2018 were $4,131.2 million, a 16 percent increase compared to 2017. The positive impact of foreign currency on total revenues year-over-year was less than one percent, or $5.9 million, inclusive of hedging activities. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the full year of 2018 was $0.35, an 82 percent decrease versus the prior year, inclusive of $1,183.0 million of expense related to the value of the in-process research and development assets acquired in 2018. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the full year of 2018 was $7.92, a 35 percent increase versus the prior year. 

Total revenues in the fourth quarter were $1,128.8 million, a 24 percent increase compared to the same period in 2017. The negative impact of foreign currency on total revenues year-over-year was 1 percent, or $5.5 million, inclusive of hedging activities. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS in the quarter was $(0.20), a 254 percent decrease versus the prior year, inclusive of $379.3 million of expense related to the value of the in-process research and development asset acquired in connection with our acquisition of Syntimmune. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $2.14, a 45 percent increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017. 

"2018 was a transformational year for Alexion. I am proud of our many accomplishments, including entering rare neurology and making SOLIRIS for gMG Alexion's best launch ever, completing the Phase 3 program and launching ULTOMIRIS for PNH in the U.S., delivering groundbreaking Phase 3 data and submitting regulatory filings for SOLIRIS in NMOSD and rebuilding our pipeline through disciplined business development, all while continuing to grow our base business," said Ludwig Hantson, Ph.D., Chief

Research and Development

PHASE 3 

•ULTOMIRISTM (ravulizumab-cwvz) - Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH): In December 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ULTOMIRIS for adults with PNH. Applications for approval in the European Union (EU) and Japan are currently under review. In addition, a Phase 3 study of ULTOMIRIS in children and adolescents with PNH is currently underway.

•ULTOMIRIS - Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS): In January 2019, Alexion announced positive topline results from a Phase 3 study of ULTOMIRIS in complement inhibitor naïve patients with aHUS. The study met its primary objective with 53.6 percent of patients demonstrating complete thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) response. The safety profile of ULTOMIRIS was generally consistent with that seen in Phase 3 studies in PNH. No cases of meningococcal infection were observed. Based on these results, Alexion plans to file for regulatory approval in the U.S. in the first half of 2019 followed by the EU and Japan. In addition, a Phase 3 study of ULTOMIRIS in adolescents and children with aHUS is currently underway.

•ULTOMIRIS - Subcutaneous: In late 2018, Alexion initiated a single, PK-based Phase 3 study of ULTOMIRIS delivered subcutaneously once per week to support registration in PNH and aHUS. Data are expected in early 2020.

•ULTOMIRIS - Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG): Alexion plans to initiate a Phase 3 study of ULTOMIRIS in gMG in the first quarter of 2019. 

•ULTOMIRIS - Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD): Alexion plans to initiate a Phase 3 study of ULTOMIRIS in NMOSD. 

•SOLIRIS - NMOSD: Alexion has submitted applications in the U.S. and the EU for the approval of eculizumab for NMOSD. These submissions are based on previously announced results from the Phase 3 PREVENT study, in which 97.9 percent of patients with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) auto antibody-positive NMOSD receiving SOLIRIS on top of stable standard-of-care therapy were free of relapse at 48 weeks compared to 63.2 percent of patients receiving placebo. Alexion also plans to file for regulatory approval in Japan later this year.

•ALXN1840 (WTX101) - Wilson Disease: Enrollment is underway in a Phase 3 study of ALXN1840 (WTX101) in Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder with devastating hepatic and neurological consequences. The study is now powered for superiority versus standard-of-care therapy. ALXN1840 is a first-in-class oral copper-binding agent with a unique mechanism of action to access and bind to serum copper and promote its removal from the liver. 

PHASE 1/2 

•ALXN1830 (SYNT001): In the fourth quarter of 2018, Alexion announced the completion of its acquisition of Syntimmune. The acquisition added anti-FcRn antibody ALXN1830 (SYNT001) to the company's clinical pipeline. ALXN1830 is currently in Phase 1b/2a development in patients with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA) and in patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) or pemphigus foliaceus (PF). In 2019, the company plans to initiate two pivotal trials - one in WAIHA following successful completion of the current Phase 1b/2a study and one in gMG.

•ALXN1810 - Subcutaneous: A Phase 1 study of subcutaneous ALXN1210 co-administered with Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug-delivery technology, PH20, is underway. Pending co-formulation data, this next-generation subcutaneous formulation will be called ALXN1810 and has the potential to further extend the dosing interval to once every two weeks or once per month. 

•ULTOMIRIS - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): Alexion plans to initiate a proof-of-concept study for ULTOMIRIS in ALS. 

•ULTOMIRIS - Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS): Alexion plans to initiate a proof-of-concept study for ULTOMIRIS in PPMS. 

•Caelum Biosciences - CAEL101 - Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis: In January 2019, Alexion entered into a collaboration with Caelum Biosciences to develop CAEL101 for AL amyloidosis, a rare systemic disorder that causes misfolded immunoglobulin light chain protein to build up in and around tissues, resulting in progressive and widespread organ damage. CAEL101 is a first-in-class amyloid fibril targeted therapy designed to improve organ function by reducing or eliminating amyloid deposits in patients with AL amyloidosis. In a Phase 1a/1b study, CAEL101 demonstrated improved organ function, including cardiac and renal function, in patients with relapsed and refractory AL amyloidosis.

PRE-CLINICAL

(2) During the year ended 2018, we recorded $13.0 million in litigation charges in connection with ongoing investigations.

(3) In September 2018, we sold all assets, rights and obligations of the ALXN1101 program to a third party and, as a result, we recognized a gain on the sale of ALXN1101 during the third quarter of 2018.

(4) During the second and fourth quarters of 2018, we completed the acquisitions of Wilson Therapeutics and Syntimmune, respectively. The acquisitions were both accounted for as asset acquisitions, as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired were concentrated in a single asset. The value of the acquired in-process research and development assets were expensed during the quarters the acquisitions were completed due to the stage of development of the assets.

(5) The change in the expense associated with the fair value of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended 2017 was primarily due to amending certain contingent milestone payments due under our prior merger agreement with Enobia Pharma Corp. in September 2018 as well as due to increases in the likelihood and anticipated timing of payments for contingent consideration.

(6) Our investments include strategic equity investments in Moderna Therapeutics, Inc. and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an unrealized gain of $43.1 million in investment income to adjust our strategic equity investments to fair value. 

(7) Alexion's non-GAAP income tax expense excludes the tax effect of pre-tax adjustments to GAAP profit and adjustments to provisional estimates of the impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we recorded in Q4 2017.

(1) In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a comprehensive new standard which amends revenue recognition principles. We adopted this standard in the first quarter 2018. Upon adoption of the new standard, we reduced our deferred revenue balance reported in Other current liabilities by $10.4 million, with an offsetting increase of $6.0 million in retained earnings due to the cumulative impact of adopting this new standard. The adjusted deferred revenue balance, as of January 1, 2018, was $5.5 million.
