•2018 E&D expenditures below guidance at $1.57 billion 

•Cimarex sold assets in Ward County, Texas, and reinvested in assets in Reeves County, Texas through the pending acquisition of Resolute Energy Corporation (expected to close March 1)

DENVER, February 20, 2019 - Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE: XEC) today reported fourth quarter 2018 net income of $316.2 million, or $3.32 per share, compared to $174.7 million, or $1.83 per share, in the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $189.7 million, or $1.98 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $140.0 million, or $1.47 per share1. Net cash provided by operating activities was $393.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $340.8 million in the same period a year ago. Adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) was $428.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $357.1 million in the fourth quarter a year ago1. 

Driven by solid execution, total company volumes for the fourth quarter averaged 251.3 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE) per day. Oil production averaged 79,904 barrels (bbls) per day, up 29 percent from the same period a year ago and up 25 percent from third quarter 2018 levels. 

Realized oil prices averaged $49.30 per barrel in the fourth quarter, down five percent from the $51.68 per barrel received in the fourth quarter of 2017 and realized natural gas prices averaged $2.16 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), down 16 percent from the fourth quarter 2017 average of $2.58 per Mcf. NGL prices averaged $20.71 per barrel, down 20 percent from the $25.88 per barrel received in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, Cimarex realized $56.61 per barrel of oil, up 20 percent from 2017, $1.99 per Mcf of natural gas and $22.28 per barrel of NGLs sold. Realized prices for 2018 reflect the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606 (ASC 606). See table below (Impact of ASC 606) for comparison of realized prices for 2018 for pre- and post-ASC 606. 

During 2018, both oil and natural gas prices were negatively impacted by local price differentials. Our realized Permian oil differential to WTI Cushing averaged $(9.82) per barrel in 2018. Cimarex's average differential on its Permian natural gas production was $(1.40) per Mcf below Henry Hub in 2018 and, in the Mid-Continent region, realized gas prices were $(0.86) per Mcf below the Henry Hub index.

Cimarex invested $1.57 billion in exploration and development (E&D) in 2018, including $380 million in the fourth quarter. Investments made in 2018 were funded with cash flow from operations and cash on the balance sheet. Total debt at December 31, 2018, consisted of $1.5 billion of long-term notes. Cimarex had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility and a cash balance of $800.7 million at year-end. Debt was 31 percent of total capitalization2. 

Proved reserves at December 31, 2018, totaled 591 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE), up six percent year over year. Proved developed reserves increased eight percent to 501 MMBOE. Cimarex added 159 MMBOE through extensions and discoveries and deducted 23 MMBOE through net revisions resulting in reserve replacement of 168 percent of 2018 production. Proved reserves are 85 percent proved developed.

On August 31, 2018, we closed on the sale of properties in Ward County, Texas, and have received $534.6 million in net cash proceeds adjusted for the resolution of all asserted defects as of December 31, 2018. On November 18, 2018, Cimarex entered into a merger agreement to acquire Resolute Energy Corporation in a cash and stock transaction valued at $1.6 billion, including the assumption of Resolute's long-term debt, which was approximately $710 million. The transaction is expected to close on March 1, 2019, and is subject to the approval of the Resolute shareholders and the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. 

Operations Update

Cimarex invested $1.57 billion in E&D in 2018--70 percent in the Permian region and 30 percent in the Mid-Continent. An additional $103 million was invested in midstream operations and other infrastructure in 2018. Of the $1.57 billion of E&D investment in 2018, $1.35 billion (86 percent) went toward the drilling and completion of new wells. 

During 2018, Cimarex participated in the drilling and completion of 349 gross (122 net) wells.

Oil volumes averaged 18,122 barrels per day and represented 18 percent of the region's total equivalent production. For the full year, production averaged 95,307 BOE per day, up 12 percent year over year.

Wells brought on production during the fourth quarter totaled 46 gross (6 net) in the Mid-Continent region, bringing the total wells in 2018 to 220 gross (42 net). At the end of the quarter, 48 gross (8 net) wells were waiting on completion.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME

The following reconciles net income as reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the noted items because management believes these items affect the comparability of operating results. The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP measures because:

a)Management uses adjusted net income to evaluate the company's operating performance between periods and to compare the company's performance to other oil and gas exploration and production companies.

b)Adjusted net income is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by research analysts.

* Does not include adjustments resulting from application of the "two-class method" used to determine earnings per share under GAAP.

** Reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period as adjusted for the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS

The following table provides a reconciliation from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures of net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted cash flows from operations (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Management uses the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted cash flow from operations as a means of measuring our ability to fund our capital program and dividends, without fluctuations caused by changes in current assets and liabilities, which are included in the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors for the same reason, and that it is also used by professional research analysts in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.

PROVED RESERVES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Pre-tax PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is comparable to the standardized measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure but without deducting future income taxes. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Cimarex's discounted future income taxes were $724.0 million and $439.8 million, respectively. Cimarex's standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $4,015.2 million at year-end 2018 and $3,285.0 million at year-end 2017. Management uses pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of the company's proved reserves and to compare relative values of proved reserves to other exploration and production companies without regard to income taxes. Management believes pre-tax PV-10 is a useful measure for comparison of proved reserve values among companies because, unlike standardized measure, it excludes future income taxes that often depend on the unique income tax characteristics of the owner of the reserves rather than on the nature, location and quality of the reserves themselves. Management further believes that professional research analysts and rating agencies use pre-tax PV-10 in similar ways. However, pre-tax PV-10 is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Cimarex's pre-tax PV-10 and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of its oil and natural gas reserves.

IMPACT OF ASC 606

Effective January 1, 2018, Cimarex adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). Application of ASC 606 has no impact on our net income or cash flows from operations; however, certain costs classified as Transportation, processing, and other operating expenses in the statement of operations under prior accounting standards are now reflected as deductions from revenue under ASC 606. The following tables present certain Pre- and Post-ASC 606 amounts:
