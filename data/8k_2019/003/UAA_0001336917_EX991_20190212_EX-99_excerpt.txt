UNDER ARMOUR REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS; REITERATES FULL YEAR 2019 OUTLOOK

BALTIMORE, February 12, 2019 – Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE: UA, UAA) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018. The company reports its financial performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP”). This press release refers to “currency neutral” and “adjusted” amounts, which are non-GAAP financial measures described below under the “Non-GAAP Financial Information” paragraph. References to adjusted financial measures exclude the impact of the company’s restructuring plans and the related tax effects, as well as adjustments to our one-time impacts of the 2017 U.S. tax reform legislation, which we refer to as the U.S. Tax Act. Reconciliations of non-GAAP amounts to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP are presented in supplemental financial information furnished with this release. All per share amounts are reported on a diluted basis.

“Our 2018 results demonstrate significant progress against our multi-year transformation toward becoming an even stronger brand and more operationally excellent company,” said Under Armour Chairman and CEO Kevin Plank. “As we look ahead to 2019, our accelerated innovation agenda, disciplined go-to-market process and powerful consumer-centric approach gives us increasingly greater confidence in our ability to deliver for Under Armour athletes, customers and shareholders.”

Of the $204 million recognized, there were $151 million in cash related charges and $53 million in non-cash related charges. This compares to the previously announced 2018 plan which anticipated approximately $200 to $220 million in restructuring related charges for the full year. 

Full Year 2019 Outlook

There are no changes to the company's 2019 outlook, which was provided at its December 12, 2018 investor day: 

•Revenue is expected to be up approximately 3 to 4 percent reflecting relatively flat results for North America and a low double-digit percentage rate increase in the international business.

• Gross margin is expected to increase approximately 60 to 80 basis points compared to 2018 adjusted gross margin due to channel mix benefits from lower planned sales to the off-price channel and a higher percentage of direct-to-consumer sales along with more favorable product costs due to ongoing supply chain initiatives.

• Operating income is expected to reach $210 million to $230 million.

•  Interest and other expense net is planned at approximately $40 million.

• Effective tax rate is expected to be in the 19 percent to 22 percent range.

• Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.33; and,

• Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $210 million.

Conference Call and Webcast

U.S. Tax Act

The U.S. Tax Act was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The legislation contained several key tax provisions that affect Under Armour and, as required, the company included reasonable estimates of the income tax effects of the changes in tax law and tax rate in the company's 2017 financial results. These changes included a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a re-measuring of deferred tax assets which impacted our fourth quarter and full year of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company revised and finalized its accounting for the one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and the re-measuring of deferred tax assets due to the U.S. Tax Act in accordance within the one-year measurement period allowed by the SEC.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

This press release refers to “currency neutral” and “adjusted” results. Currency neutral financial information is calculated to exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency. Management believes this information is useful to investors to facilitate a comparison of the company's results of operations period-over-period. Adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of restructuring and other related charges and the impact of the U.S. Tax Act, as applicable. Management believes this information is useful to investors because it provides enhanced visibility into the company’s actual underlying results excluding the impact of its restructuring plans and recent significant changes in U.S. tax laws. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation and should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
