(the “Company”) issued 185,000 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s 6.00% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series EE, par value of $1.00 per share and with a liquidation preference of $10,000 per share (the “Series EE Preferred Stock”), which Shares were deposited against delivery of depositary receipts (the “Depositary Receipts”) evidencing 74,000,000 depositary shares (the “Depositary Shares”), each representing 1/400th of a Share, issued by Computershare Inc, as depositary.  

Under the terms of the Series EE Preferred Stock, the ability of the Company to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment on its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series EE Preferred Stock, will be subject to restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare dividends on the Series EE Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period or, in the case of any such liquidation payment, does not pay to holders of the Series EE Preferred Stock liquidation distributions of $10,000 per Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. The terms of the Series EE Preferred Stock are more fully described in the Certificate of Designations (as defined below), which establishes the rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations relating to the Series EE Preferred Stock.
