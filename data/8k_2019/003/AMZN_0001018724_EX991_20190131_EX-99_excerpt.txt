AWS Control Tower gives customers an automated “landing zone” that makes it easy to set up their multi-account environment and continuously govern their AWS workloads with rules for security, operations, and compliance; AWS Security Hub is a central place to manage security and compliance across an AWS environment so that customers can quickly see their AWS security and compliance state in one comprehensive view; AWS Lake Formation makes it much easier for customers to build a secure data lake by simplifying and automating many of the complex manual steps usually required, including collecting, cleaning, and cataloging data; and AWS Backup is a centralized backup service that makes it faster and simpler for customers to back up their data across AWS services and on-premises, helping them more easily meet their business and regulatory backup compliance requirements. 

•AWS continued to expand on the industry’s broadest and most capable set of storage offerings with the introduction of the Amazon FSx family and additional storage classes for Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Amazon FSx for Windows File Server and Amazon FSx for Lustre are fully managed file system services that provide cost effective, scalable file storage for Windows and compute-intensive workloads. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically optimizes customers’ storage costs for data with unknown or changing access patterns by moving data to the most cost-effective storage tier; Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive delivers the lowest cost storage from any cloud provider at just $0.00099 per GB per month, making it ideal for customers who have large data sets they want to retain for a long time, letting them eliminate the cost and management of tape infrastructure, while ensuring that their data is well preserved for future use and analysis. 

Financial Guidance

The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 31, 2019, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. 

First Quarter 2019 Guidance

•Net sales are expected to be between $56 billion and $60 billion, or to grow between 10% and 18% compared with first quarter 2018. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates. 

•Operating income is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in first quarter 2018. 

•This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 

governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.
