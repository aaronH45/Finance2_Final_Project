2 Fiscal First Quarter 2019 — Financial Highlights Net income in the fiscal first quarter was $3.0 billion or $1.30 per share, increases of 18% and 21%, respectively, over prior year’s results. Excluding two special items in prior year’s results related to U.S. tax reform, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 17% and 21%, respectively, over prior year’s results (refer to the accompanying financial tables for further details and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures presented). Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted earnings per share growth by approximately 0.5 percentage points. All references to earnings per share assume fully-diluted class A share count. Net revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $5.5 billion, an increase of 13%, driven by continued growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted reported net revenues growth by approximately 0.5 percentage points. The Company adopted the new revenue accounting standard effective October 1, 2018, which positively impacted reported net revenues growth by approximately 1 percentage point. Payments volume for the three months ended September 30, 2018, on which fiscal first quarter service revenues are recognized, grew 12% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Payments volume for the three months ended December 31, 2018, grew 11% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume growth, on a constant-dollar basis, was 7% for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by Visa, for the three months ended December 31, 2018, were 33.9 billion, an 11% increase over the prior year. Fiscal first quarter service revenues were $2.3 billion, an increase of 9% over the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 15% over the prior year to $2.5 billion. International transaction revenues grew 11% over the prior year to $1.9 billion. Other revenues of $299 million rose 30% over the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $1.5 billion and represent 20.9% of gross revenues. Operating expenses were $1.8 billion for the fiscal first quarter, a 17% increase over the prior year's results, primarily driven by personnel and marketing costs. The new revenue accounting standard increased reported operating expense growth by approximately 2.5 percentage points. Effective income tax rate was 18.0% for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Cash, cash equivalents and investment securities were $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2018. The weighted-average number of diluted shares of class A common stock outstanding was 2.29 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.  

 3 Fiscal First Quarter 2019 — Payments Volume Definition Update As Visa’s business continues to evolve beyond purchases at merchants, Visa updated its definition of reported Payments Volume to account for all new payment flows carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands. The updated definition now includes all disbursement, or “push payment”, volume. The previous definition only included funding, or “pull payment”, volume related to Visa Direct. All prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the updated definition that better captures the payments volume for which Visa receives revenue. Refer to the operational performance data for the impact of the definition change on the current and prior periods. Fiscal First Quarter 2019 — Other Notable Items On January 24, 2019, the district court granted preliminary approval of the settlement which was announced in September 2018 to resolve monetary class claims in the multi-district interchange litigation. The court scheduled a final approval hearing in November 2019. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 16.9 million shares of class A common stock, at an average price of $137.82 per share, using $2.3 billion of cash on hand. The board of directors authorized a new $8.5 billion class A common stock share repurchase program on January 29, 2019. Including this additional authorization, the Company now has $9.8 billion of funds available for share repurchase. On January 29, 2019, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as- converted basis) payable on March 5, 2019, to all holders of record as of February 15, 2019. Financial Outlook for Fiscal Full-Year 2019 Visa Inc. reaffirms its fiscal full-year 2019 financial outlook for the following metrics:  Annual net revenue growth: Low double-digits on a nominal basis, with approximately 1 percentage point of negative foreign currency impact and de minimus impact from the new revenue accounting standard  Client incentives as a percentage of gross revenues: 22% to 23% range  Annual operating expense growth: Mid-single digit decrease on a GAAP basis and mid-to-high single digit increase adjusted for special items in fiscal 2018 (see note below). GAAP and non-GAAP growth includes an approximately 1.5 to 2 percentage point increase from the new revenue accounting standard  Effective tax rate: 20.0% to 20.5% range  Annual diluted class A common stock earnings per share growth: High teens on a GAAP nominal dollar basis and mid- teens on an adjusted, non-GAAP nominal dollar basis (see note below). Both include approximately 1 percentage point of negative foreign currency impact Note: Annual adjusted operating expense growth is derived from adjusted full-year 2018 operating expenses of $6.9 billion.

 10 Visa Inc. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Results (unaudited) Our financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 reflected the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our operating performance in these or future periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2018. • Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion. • Transition tax on foreign earnings. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. Adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table reconciles our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2017. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2018.

 11 Visa Inc. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Results – continued (unaudited) Our financial outlook for fiscal full-year 2019 annual operating expense growth and annual diluted class A common stock earnings per share growth are based on adjusted non-GAAP fiscal full-year 2018 results, which are reconciled to their closest comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure below. Our financial results during the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 reflected the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our ongoing operating performance in these or future periods as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. • Charitable contribution. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we donated available-for-sale investment securities to the Visa Foundation and recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $195 million, before tax, and recorded $193 million of realized gain on the donation of these investments as non-operating income. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $51 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income decreased by $49 million. • Litigation provision. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a litigation provision of $600 million and related tax benefits of $137 million associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. • Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion. • Transition tax on foreign earnings. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion.

17 Footnote Payments volume, including Visa Direct volume, represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands for the relevant period, and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks, but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments and cash volume. Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa’s signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs. The data presented is based on transactions processed by Visa and reported by Visa’s financial institution clients on their operating certificates. Estimates may be utilized if data is unavailable. On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates, if any, are not material. Europe is reported and included in Visa Inc. results effective with the 3 months ended September 2016. Visa’s CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. International includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA, Europe and LAC. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported (“Nominal USD”). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information (“Constant USD”). This presentation represents Visa’s historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement. Effective June 9, 2016, Article 8 of the EU Interchange Fee Regulation states that payment card networks cannot impose reporting requirements or the obligation to pay fees on payment transactions where their payment brand is present but their network is not used. Prior to this regulation, Visa collected a small service fee in a few countries, particularly France, on domestic payment transactions where Visa cards are co-badged with a domestic network. Clients in Europe continued to report co-badged volume through the quarter ended September 2016; however, Europe co-badged volume and transactions have been excluded from all periods.
