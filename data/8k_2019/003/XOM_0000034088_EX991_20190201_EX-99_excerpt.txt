IRVING, Texas – February 1, 2019 – Exxon Mobil Corporation today announced estimated 2018 earnings of $20.8 billion, or $4.88 per share assuming dilution, compared with $19.7 billion a year earlier. Excluding U.S. tax reform and asset impairments, earnings were $21 billion, compared with $15.3 billion in 2017. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $40.1 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $4.1 billion. Capital and exploration expenditures were $25.9 billion, including incremental spend to accelerate value capture. 

Fourth quarter 2018 earnings were $6 billion, or $1.41 per share assuming dilution, compared with $8.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. Earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were $6.4 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in the prior-year quarter.  

“Strong results during a period of commodity price volatility demonstrate ExxonMobil’s ability to deliver superior cash flow in different market environments,” said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our continued focus on long-term fundamentals and portfolio improvements position us well to grow shareholder value. ExxonMobil’s 2018 results further demonstrate our advantages in technology, scale and integration, providing a strong foundation to successfully compete across commodity price cycles.”

Twelve Months 2018 Financial Updates 

During 2018, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 5 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $425 million. These shares were acquired to offset dilution in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. The corporation will continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with its benefit plans and programs, but does not currently plan on making purchases to reduce shares outstanding.

Cautionary Statement 

Outlooks, projections, goals, targets, descriptions of business plans and objectives, and other statements of future events or conditions in this release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project plans, capacities, and timing; resource recoveries; earnings, margins and volume growth and mix; and maintenance activities could differ materially due to a number of factors. These include global or regional changes in supply and demand for oil, gas, and petrochemicals and other market conditions that impact prices and differentials; reservoir performance; timely completion of new projects; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms and the outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in law, taxes, or government operations or regulation and timely granting of governmental permits; war and other political or security disturbances; the actions of competitors; the capture of efficiencies between business lines; unforeseen technical or operating difficulties; unexpected technological developments; general economic conditions including the occurrence and duration of economic recessions; the results of research programs; and other factors discussed under the heading Factors Affecting Future Results on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil’s 2017 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date. 

Forward-looking statements in this release regarding future earnings refer to plans outlined at ExxonMobil’s Analysts’ Meeting held on March 7, 2018. The growth figures presented at that meeting are not forecasts of actual future results but were intended to help quantify future potential and goals of management plans and initiatives. See the complete March 7, 2018 presentation available in archive form (including the Cautionary Statement and Supplemental Information included with that presentation) on the Investors page of our website at www.exxonmobil.com for more detailed information. That material includes a description of the assumptions underlying these potential growth estimates including a flat real oil price of $60 per barrel, downstream and chemical margins consistent with 2017 levels, and future gas prices consistent with our internal company plans, as well as a reconciliation of adjusted 2017 earnings used as a baseline. 

Frequently Used Terms and Non-GAAP Measures 

This press release includes cash flow from operations and asset sales. Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown for 2018 period on page 8 and for 2018 and 2017 periods in Attachment IV.  

This press release also includes total taxes including sales-based taxes. This is a broader indicator of the total tax burden on the corporation’s products and earnings, including certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities (“sales-based taxes”). It combines “Income taxes” and “Total other taxes and duties” with sales‑based taxes, which are reported net in the income statement. We believe it is useful for the corporation and its investors to understand the total tax burden imposed on the corporation’s products and earnings. A reconciliation to total taxes is shown as part of the Estimated Key Financial and Operating Data in Attachment I.

This press release also includes earnings excluding impacts from U.S. tax reform enactment and asset impairments. We believe these figures are useful for investors to consider in comparing the performance of our underlying business across periods when one, or both, periods have been impacted by the U.S. tax reform or an asset impairment charge. A reconciliation of earnings excluding these items to U.S. GAAP earnings is shown on page 4.  

U.S. Tax Reform  

Following the December 22, 2017, enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 (Income Taxes) and following the guidance outlined in the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, the corporation included a $5,942 million credit in its 2017 results, representing a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects of the changes in tax law and tax rate. The corporation’s results for 2018 include a $291 million tax credit, mainly in the Non-U.S. Upstream, reflecting an updated estimate of the impact of U.S. tax reform including clarifications provided in proposed transition tax regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in 2018. The corporation has completed its accounting for the enactment-date income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 (Income Taxes). 

Asset Impairments 

In 2018, the corporation assessed the carrying values of certain assets, largely located in North America and with limited development potential. This review resulted in an after-tax impairment charge of $429 million in the fourth quarter. In 2017, the corporation ceased development planning activities for certain non-producing assets outside the U.S. and recognized impairments for certain U.S. asset groups which resulted in a fourth quarter 2017 after-tax charge of $1,294 million. 

References to the resource base and other quantities of oil, natural gas or condensate may include amounts that are not yet classified as “proved reserves” under SEC definitions, but which we believe will likely be moved into the “proved reserves” category and produced in the future. The term “project” as used in this release can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Further information on ExxonMobil’s frequently used financial and operating measures and other terms including “Cash flow from operations and asset sales”, and “Total taxes including sales‑based taxes” is contained under the heading “Frequently Used Terms” available through the “Investors” section of our website at exxonmobil.com.
