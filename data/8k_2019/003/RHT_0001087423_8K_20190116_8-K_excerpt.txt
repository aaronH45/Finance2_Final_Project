On January 16, 2019, Red Hat, Inc. (the “Company”) held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). Of the 176,759,752 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 11, 2018, the record date for the Special Meeting, 141,810,844 shares were represented at the Special Meeting (in person or by proxy), constituting 80.23% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote and a quorum to conduct business at the Special Meeting.  

At the Special Meeting, stockholders of the Company (1) approved the adoption of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 28, 2018 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), and Socrates Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM (“Sub”), pursuant to which, among other things, Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM (the “Merger”) and (2) approved, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger.
