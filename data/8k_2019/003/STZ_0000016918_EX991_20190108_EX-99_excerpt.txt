•Completes additional $4 billion investment in Canopy Growth Corporation on November 1, 2018

•Declares quarterly cash dividend

”The results delivered by our beer business mark the highlight of our third quarter performance. The Modelo and Corona brand families continue to be on fire, fueled by strong velocities, excellent distribution gains and highly incremental innovation. Our leadership in the high-end U.S. beer industry positioned us to be the most significant growth contributor at retail during the quarter.” 

“Our focus on innovation is driving incremental growth for our beverage alcohol portfolio. We recently introduced Meiomi Sparkling, Crafters Union canned wine and Mi CAMPO tequila, which tap into fast growing sectors of the Wine and Spirits market. Corona Premier continues to drive strong growth as a trade up for consumers who want a low calorie, low carb option. Our innovation pipeline will continue to fuel growth for our business in the years ahead.”

HIGHLIGHTS[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Strong shipment volume was primarily timing related as fiscal year-to-date shipment and depletion volume are closely aligned.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

●  The beer business won the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays as Corona Premier, Modelo Especial and Corona Familiar were the “top 3” high-end beer share gainers for the third quarter.

●  The beer business now expects fiscal 2019 net sales growth to be at the high end of the 9 - 11% range and operating margin to approximate 39%.

HIGHLIGHTS

•Focus on higher retail price points for the wine business is paying off. In last 52 weeks, Constellation outperformed the U.S. wine market at the greater than $11 price point with several Focus Brands growing double digits in IRI channels during this timeframe, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, The Prisoner and Meiomi. Depletion performance for the below $11 price point continues to be challenged, resulting in an overall fiscal year-to-date depletion decline of 2%.

•Fiscal year-to-date U.S. shipment volume has outpaced fiscal year-to-date depletion volume; this shipment timing benefit is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter.

“We expect the powerful cash generation capability of our core business to enable significant cash returns of $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends within the next three fiscal years. We plan to operate within our targeted leverage range, as we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating.”

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

Reported basis (“reported”) are amounts as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Comparable basis (“comparable”) are amounts which exclude items that affect comparability (“comparable adjustments”), as they are not reflective of core operations of the segments. The company’s measure of segment profitability excludes comparable adjustments, which is consistent with the measure used by management to evaluate results. The company discusses various non-GAAP measures in this news release. Financial statements, as well as supplemental schedules and tables reconciling non-GAAP measures, together with definitions of these measures and the reasons management uses these measures, are included in this news release.

The Projections are based on management’s current expectations and, unless otherwise noted, do not take into account the impact of any future acquisition, merger or any other business combination, divestiture, restructuring or other strategic business realignments, financing or share repurchase that may be completed after the date of this release. The Projections should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results will in fact occur.

In addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations, the Projections of the company contained in this news release are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:

•beer operations expansion, construction and optimization activities, and costs and timing associated with these activities, may vary from management’s current estimates;
