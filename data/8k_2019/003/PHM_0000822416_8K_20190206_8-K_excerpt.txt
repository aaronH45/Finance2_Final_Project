PulteGroup, Inc. 2019 Senior Management Incentive Plan

On February 6, 2019, the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of PulteGroup, Inc. (the “Company”) adopted the PulteGroup, Inc. 2019 Senior Management Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), which replaces and is based on the 2013 Senior Management Incentive Plan. The following paragraphs provide a summary of certain terms of the Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan is set forth in its entirety as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. 

The Committee administers the Incentive Plan and will designate the eligible individuals who will participate in the Incentive Plan for a specified performance period. All officers of the Company (including each of the Company’s named executive officers) and its subsidiaries are eligible to be designated for participation in the Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan provides for incentive awards to eligible participants based on the achievement of performance goals for performance periods commencing on or after January 1, 2019. 

Upon attainment of the relevant performance goals, a participant will be eligible to receive an award determined based on the achievement of such performance goals, unless the award is subject to other terms and conditions established by the Committee, including, as a condition to vesting, the continued employment of the participant for a specified period of time subsequent to the end of a performance period. No participant will be eligible to receive an award for any performance period having a value in excess of $15 million (this limit will be prorated for performance periods lasting less than one year). The awards under the Incentive Plan may be paid in cash or in common shares of the Company, or partly in cash and partly in common shares, with any common shares to be issued under the Company’s stock incentive plan then in effect.
