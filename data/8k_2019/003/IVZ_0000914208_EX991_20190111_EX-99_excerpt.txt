Atlanta, January 10, 2019 --- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management (AUM) of $888.2 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. The decrease was driven by unfavorable market returns, net long-term outflows, and lower money market AUM, partially offset by reinvested distributions of $8.2 billion, non-management fee earning AUM inflows, and foreign exchange. FX increased AUM by $0.5 billion. Preliminary average total AUM for the quarter through December 31 were $924.4 billion, and preliminary average active AUM for the quarter through December 31 were $689.1 billion.
