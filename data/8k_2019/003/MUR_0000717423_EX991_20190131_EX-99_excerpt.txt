 “2018 was a really good year for Murphy with our net income at the highest level in four years. We continued to benefit from our diverse, growing, oil-weighted portfolio that was able to continuously generate high cash flow per barrel metrics. We demonstrated again that we are proven deal-makers by successfully closing on an accretive oil-weighted transaction that will further enhance our ability to generate cash flow. Also, we remain committed to rewarding shareholders with cash returns through our long-standing competitive dividend, while we keep investment in our assets in line with our cash flows,” stated Roger W. Jenkins, President and Chief Executive Officer.

 FINANCIAL POSITION   

 As of December 31, 2018, the company had $2.8 billion of outstanding long-term, fixed-rate notes, $325 million of borrowings on the $1.6 billion unsecured senior credit facility, and approximately $387 million in cash and cash equivalents, including noncontrolling interest, at year-end. The fixed-rate notes had a weighted average maturity of 7.8 years and a weighted average coupon of 5.5 percent.   

 YEAR-END 2018 PROVED RESERVES   

 Murphy’s preliminary year-end 2018 proved reserves were 816 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE), a 17 percent increase from 698 MMBOE at year-end 2017. The change in year-over-year reserves is mainly attributed to the acquisition of Gulf of Mexico reserves through the MP GOM transaction as well as organic additions in both the Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper Montney assets. Organic reserve replacement was 166 percent and one-year finding and development cost were $10.92 per BOE, with a three-year cumulative finding and development cost of $10.62 per BOE.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 “Our team did an excellent job adding low-cost, high-value reserves in 2018. We were able to increase our proved reserves by 17 percent and more importantly increase our oil reserves by 24 percent from 2017. We continue to replace reserves with finding and development costs tracking below $11 per BOE. We are especially pleased with the additional oil reserves from our new Gulf of Mexico assets where the initial booking at year-end was above our original estimated volumes,” commented Jenkins.

 REGIONAL OPERATIONS SUMMARY   

 North American Onshore  

 The North American onshore business produced over 93 MBOEPD in the fourth quarter.  

 Eagle Ford Shale – Production in the quarter averaged over 40 MBOEPD, with 88 percent liquids. As planned, the company brought eight operated wells online during the quarter, all in the Catarina area.   

 Tupper Montney – Natural gas production in the quarter averaged over 230 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD), after allowing for over 6 MMCFD impacts related to third-party plant and pipeline restrictions. During the fourth quarter, the company celebrated the asset’s tenth anniversary milestone, producing over 600 billion cubic feet (BCF) gross since inception.  

 Kaybob Duvernay – During the quarter, the company achieved record production averaging 11 MBOEPD with 59 percent liquids. Murphy has increased production in this play for seven consecutive quarters. As planned, the company brought five operated wells online: a four well pad in Kaybob West and one well in Two Creeks. The four well pad in Kaybob West performed in-line with pre-drill estimates, achieving average initial gross production rates over 30 days (IP30 rate) of over 900 BOEPD per well, with 67 percent liquids. The Two Creeks well, drilled by the previous operator at a less than optimal lateral length of 5,500 feet, was completed and brought online at initial gross production rates of 600 barrels of oil (BOPD) with 87 percent liquids. Over the course of 2018 the company brought 27 wells online, which advanced the appraisal of the play.  

 “We continue to be pleased with our North American unconventional business. Our steadfast Tupper Montney asset continues to provide free cash flow at current prices due to our market diversity and execution. Success continues in the Kaybob Duvernay, with strong well performance across the play, and promising early results in the Two Creeks area, support our plan to retain the vast majority of our acreage. In Eagle Ford Shale we jump-started our 2019 program and are currently running four rigs and two frac spreads, adding profitable production growth in the asset with additional capital allocation going forward,” commented Jenkins.  

 Global Offshore   

 The offshore business produced 83 MBOEPD for the fourth quarter, with 76 percent liquids.  

 Malaysia & Brunei – Production in the quarter averaged 46 MBOEPD, with 63 percent liquids. Block K and Sarawak averaged 28 thousand barrels of liquids per day, while Sarawak natural gas production averaged over 99 MMCFD.   

 Vietnam – Early in 2019, Murphy received the Declaration of Commerciality for the LDV field and expects to move forward with sanction later this year.  

 North America – Production in the quarter for the Gulf of Mexico averaged 32 MBOEPD, with 92 percent liquids. Canada offshore averaged 5 MBOEPD.  

 4  

As previously announced in fourth quarter 2018 Murphy closed a Gulf of Mexico transaction with Petrobras America Inc., a subsidiary of Petrobras, for a net, after closing adjustments, cash consideration of $795 million and a 20 percent NCI in MP GOM. The bolt-on transaction provides oil-weighted production and reserves with areas that have additional upside, while utilizing the company’s proven deep-water execution expertise. The contribution from MP GOM in the above volume was limited to one-month only, and was negatively impacted by a well in the Chinook field experiencing a mechanical malfunction, resulting in a daily loss of 4,400 BOEPD net. This well is expected to be worked over in late 2019.   

 Also in the quarter, the Dalmatian subsea pump was installed. Currently, the pump is delivering gross incremental production of over 10,000 BOEPD, an increase of 250 percent from prior quarter production, with 96 percent uptime.  

 EXPLORATION   

 Gulf of Mexico Exploration – During the fourth quarter, Murphy drilled the King Cake exploration well (Atwater Valley 23) which encountered non-commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was subsequently plugged and abandoned. The well, which Murphy operated at a 35 percent working interest, cost $16 million net, pre-tax, which is included in the company’s fourth quarter dry hole expense.  

 Mexico Exploration – During the fourth quarter, Murphy secured its drilling permit from the Comisión Nacional de Hidrocarburos (“CNH”) for the Cholula exploration well and expects to spud the well in the first quarter of 2019.   

 Vietnam Exploration – Murphy expects to spud the LDT-1X well, in Block 15-01/05 in the Cuu Long Basin, during the first quarter of 2019.   

 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND PRODUCTION GUIDANCE  

 Murphy is planning 2019 capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.45 billion with full year 2019 production to be in the range of 202 to 210 MBOEPD. Production for the first quarter 2019 is estimated to be in the range of 198 to 202 MBOEPD. Both production and CAPEX guidance ranges exclude Gulf of Mexico noncontrolling interest (NCI). The 2019 plan reflects the company’s ongoing commitment of keeping spending in line with cash flows while simultaneously returning cash to shareholders.   

 The table below illustrates the capital allocation by area.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 5  

For 2019, Murphy is allocating $878 million of capital, or 63 percent, to its North America onshore assets, in comparison to $780 million, or 66 percent in 2018.  

 In the Eagle Ford Shale, Murphy will spend approximately $600 million in 2019, a 40 percent increase from 2018. The Eagle Ford Shale capital includes approximately $470 million for drilling and completing wells and $130 million for field development and nine non-operated wells. The 2019 plan includes 90 operated wells being brought online which are expected to be equally distributed across the company’s acreage. This is over an 80 percent increase in operated wells online compared to 2018.  

 The company is allocating $280 million to Canada onshore in the Kaybob Duvernay, Tupper Montney and Placid Montney. In the Kaybob Duvernay, Murphy is allocating $200 million, which is 25 percent lower than in 2018. The Kaybob Duvernay capital allocation will focus only on lease retention across the play. The Kaybob Duvernay, Tupper Montney and Placid Montney will deliver 12, 8, and 7 wells online respectively.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Production for North America onshore assets, for full year 2019, is expected to increase approximately six percent, to over 100,800 BOEPD as compared to over 94,600 BOEPD for full year 2018. Production in the Eagle Ford Shale is expected to increase from 2018 levels by 4 to 6 MBOEPD. The Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney areas are expected to have annual production over 12 MBOEPD, an 8 percent increase from 2018. In the Tupper Montney, production is expected to be approximately 235 MMCFD, in line with 2018 volumes.   

 Murphy is allocating approximately $360 million of capital to its global offshore assets of which 60 percent will be spent in the Gulf of Mexico, 30 percent in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brunei, and the remainder in Canada offshore. The capital in the Gulf of Mexico is primarily related to field development projects, including the Dalmatian subsea pump and the Samurai field development activities. Murphy will also be investing capital for a pre-FEED waterflood study for the St. Malo field. In Malaysia, the 2019 capital is primarily related to the Block H FLNG project which is expected to come online in 2020, in addition to development drilling projects related to Gumusut-Kakap and Sarawak, as well as Kikeh Gas Lift.  

 The company is allocating approximately $110 million to exploration in 2019, with 53 percent for drilling, 21 percent for geological and geophysical studies, and the remainder for other explorations costs.   

 6  

“Our 2019 capital program supports our strategy of allocating capital to high margin, oil-weighted assets by investing in our profitable Eagle Ford Shale business while supporting our long-lived, free cash flow providing offshore assets. Our investment program is based on spending within our means while generating free cash flow in addition to our current dividend level,” commented Jenkins.  

 Detailed guidance for the first quarter and full year 2019 is contained in the following schedule.
