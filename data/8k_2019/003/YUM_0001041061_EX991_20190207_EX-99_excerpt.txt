GREG CREED & DAVID GIBBS COMMENTS

Greg Creed, CEO, said “I am very proud of what we have been able to accomplish in just two short years since we announced the transformation of Yum!. In 2018, our diverse portfolio of iconic brands generated over $49 billion in system sales and ended the year with over 48,000 restaurants. Focus on our four growth drivers, increased collaboration and a new mindset are fueling strong results. During 2018, system sales grew 5% with same store sales growth of 2%, and net unit growth of 4%, excluding the impact of Telepizza. Combined across our brands and led by over 2,000 world-class franchisees, we opened a record 8 gross new restaurants per day across the globe in 2018. As we move into 2019, we will continue to pursue even more growth, leverage our unprecedented scale, and maximize value for all Yum! stakeholders.”

David Gibbs, President, COO and CFO, continued “Fourth-quarter results were a strong finish to a solid year, and serve as a healthy foundation for our 2019 guidance. I am also pleased that we made significant progress on our transformation commitments in 2018, having achieved our goal of becoming at least 98% franchised. Our commitment to being more focused, more franchised and more efficient is strengthening our enviable business model. Yum! is well positioned to leverage our massive scale and expand our capabilities in order to improve franchise unit economics and accelerate growth.”

TACO BELL DIVISION

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

●Taco Bell Division opened 151 new restaurants during the quarter.

 ○For the year, Taco Bell Division opened 309 new restaurants, including 94 international new restaurants.

●Operating margin decreased 1.7 percentage points for the quarter and 2.1 percentage points for the year driven by the gross up of advertising and other franchise service revenues offset by refranchising and same-store sales growth.

OTHER ITEMS

●Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard on revenue recognition. As a result, we are now required to recognize upfront fees, such as initial and renewal fees we receive from franchisees, as revenue over the term of the related franchise agreement. We also record incentive payments we may make to franchisees (e.g., equipment funding provided under the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement) as a reduction of revenue over the period of expected cash flows from the franchise agreements to which the payment relates. Under our historical accounting, we recognized upfront fees from franchisees in full upon commencement of the related franchise agreements and incentive payments made to franchisees when we were obligated to make the payment. 

Additionally, the new accounting standard requires us to begin recording other revenues we receive from franchisees and the related expenses on a gross basis within our Income Statement. Previously, these revenues and expenses, the largest of which relate to franchisee contributions to and subsequent expenditures from advertising cooperatives we consolidate, were reported on a net basis within our Income Statement. We have reported these revenues and expenses in our Income Statement on the two new line items of franchise contributions for advertising and other services and Franchise advertising and other services expense. 

Prior results have not been restated for the impact of this accounting change and therefore remain reported as they have been historically. However, the adoption was done on a modified retrospective basis resulting in the current year impact being reported as if the now-required accounting had been in place since the inception of currently active franchise agreements or when Franchise incentive payments were originally made. As a result of the new standard, core operating profit growth was negatively impacted by six percentage points during the fourth quarter and two percentage points on a full-year basis.

●Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our Restricted Group capital structure will be provided at the time of the filing of the 2018 Form 10-K.

●Our Effective Tax Rate and Effective Tax Rate Before Special Items were negatively impacted due to a reserve of approximately $20 million we recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The reserve related to a dispute concerning the income tax rate to be applied to our 2018 income in a foreign market.

●During the fourth quarter of 2018 a subsidiary of Taco Bell Corp. issued $1.45 billion of Securitization Notes. Proceeds were used to repay $0.8 billion of existing securitization notes issued in 2016, repay the then $0.3 billion outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility and for general corporate purposes including capital return to shareholders.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

In addition to the results provided in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), the Company provides the following non-GAAP measurements.

•System sales and System sales excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation ("FX"). System sales include the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company-owned and franchise restaurants that operate our Concepts. Sales of franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the Company at a rate of 3% to 6% of sales. Franchise restaurant sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Company’s revenues. We believe System sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates our primary revenue drivers, Company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth.

•Diluted Earnings Per Share ("EPS") excluding Special Items (as defined below);

•Effective Tax Rate excluding Special Items;

•Core Operating Profit. Core Operating Profit excludes Special Items and FX and we use Core Operating Profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally.

These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.

Special Items are not included in any of our Division segment results as the Company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature. Our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of Special Items when assessing segment performance. The Special Items are described in (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) in the accompanying notes.

Certain non-GAAP measurements are presented excluding the impact of FX. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the FX impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 EPS GUIDANCE

We have also provided certain forward-looking guidance using non-GAAP measurements. Specifically, in connection with the announcement of our strategic transformation initiatives in 2016, we announced a 2019 Diluted EPS target of at least $3.75 (“2019 Adjusted EPS Target”). This 2019 Adjusted EPS Target was intended to exclude:

•Any impact from changes in FX rates (i.e. FX rates were assumed not to change from those in place when we determined the 2019 Adjusted EPS Target in 2016)

•Any Special Items; and

•The impact of the 53rd week in 2019 for our U.S. businesses and certain international subsidiaries that report on a period calendar;

Additionally, we acquired an interest in Grubhub common stock subsequent to our original determination of the 2019 Adjusted EPS Target and thus are excluding any resulting mark-to-market adjustment for that investment from the 2019 Adjusted EPS target.

At this time, we are unable to forecast any Special Items or Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments for 2019, and therefore cannot provide an estimate of 2019 EPS on a GAAP basis. The forecasted impacts of FX and the 53rd week on our 2019 Adjusted EPS Target are shown below. This impact of FX has been determined as the difference in translating our current local currency forecasts for 2019 at current FX forward rates and FX rates at the time the 2019 Adjusted EPS target was determined in 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The fourth quarter 2018 net refranchising gains related primarily to refranchising Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. and KFC restaurants in Russia. The fourth quarter 2017 net refranchising gains related primarily to refranchising KFC restaurants in Thailand, Australia and the UK, and the refranchising of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in the U.S. 

(c)In the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced our plan to transform our business. Major features of the Company's strategic transformation plans involve being more focused on development of our three brands, increasing our franchise ownership and creating a leaner, more efficient cost structure (“YUM’s Strategic Transformation Initiatives”). During the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized Special Item charges of $6 million and $8 million, respectively, related to these initiatives. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized Special Item charges of $8 million and $23 million, respectively. In the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, these costs related primarily to contract termination costs that were recorded within G&A. During the remainder of 2018 and 2017, these costs related primarily to severance and relocation costs that were recorded within G&A.

(d)On May 1, 2017, we reached an agreement with our Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees that will improve brand marketing alignment, accelerate enhancements in operations and technology and includes a permanent commitment to incremental advertising contributions by franchisees beginning in 2018. In connection with this agreement, we recognized Special Item charges of $3 million and $11 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we recognized Special Item charges of $6 million and $31 million, respectively. The majority of these costs were recorded within Franchise and property expenses. 

(e)During the first quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with our KFC U.S. franchisees that gave us brand marketing control as well as an accelerated path to improved assets and customer experience. In connection with this agreement, we recognized Special Item charges of less than $1 million and $5 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we recognized Special Item charges of $2 million and $17 million, respectively. The majority of these costs were recorded within Franchise and property expenses. 

(f)In connection with the separation of Yum China, we modified certain share-based compensation awards held as part of our Executive Income Deferral Plan in YUM stock to provide one Yum China share-based award for each outstanding YUM share-based award. Through October 31, 2018, these Yum China awards could be settled in cash, as opposed to stock, which requires recognition of the fair value of these awards within G&A in our Consolidated Income Statement. During both the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a non-cash Special Item change of less than $1 million related to these awards. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a non-cash Special Item credit of $3 million and a non-cash Special Item charge of $18 million, respectively, related to these awards. 

(g)We recorded a non-cash charge of $22 million related to the adjustment of certain historical deferred vested liability balances in our qualified U.S. plan during the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2016 the Company allowed certain former employees with deferred vested balances in the YUM Retirement Plan an opportunity to voluntarily elect an early payout of their pension benefits. In connection with this program we incurred an additional Special Items settlement charge of $1 million during the third quarter of 2017. These charges are recorded in Other pension (income) expense.

18

(h)Tax Benefit (Expense) on Special Items was determined based upon the impact of the nature, as well as the jurisdiction of the respective individual components within Special Items. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2018, we recorded a $19 million increase to our Income tax provision for the correction of an error associated with the tax recorded on a prior year divestiture, the effects of which were previously recorded as a Special Item. 

(i)During the quarter and year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $4 million and $66 million decreases, respectively, related to our provisional tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Act") that was reported as a Special Item. These amounts included tax benefit in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2018 related to current year U.S. foreign tax credits that became realizable directly as a result of the impact of deemed repatriation tax expense associated with the Tax Act.
