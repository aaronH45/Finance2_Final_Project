We periodically evaluate and refine our methodologies used to allocate items among our business operating segments. In the first quarter of 2018, we enhanced our assumptions for the liquidity and deposit component within our Funds Transfer Pricing (“FTP”) methodology which provides a credit for sources of funds and a charge for the use of funds by each business operating segment. The enhancement largely provides increased credit for the stability of deposit composition, and an increased charge for unused commitments under lending arrangements. Prior periods have not been adjusted for this change.

Adjusted average assets include quarterly average assets, less deductions for disallowed goodwill and other intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities related to tax deductible goodwill, and the accumulated other comprehensive income impact related to the adoption of post-retirement benefit plan guidance under GAAP.

Deferred tax liabilities relate to tax-deductible goodwill, which is netted against goodwill when calculating tangible common equity.

KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS, NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS  

(in millions, except share, per-share and ratio data)  

 Key Performance Metrics:  

Our Management uses certain key performance metrics (KPMs) to gauge our progress against strategic and operational goals, as well as to compare our performance against peers. The KPMs are referred to in our Registration Statements on Form S-1 and our external financial reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The KPMs include:  

 •    

Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE);  

 •    

Return on average total tangible assets (ROTA);  

 •    

Efficiency ratio;  

 •    

Operating leverage; and  

 •    

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio.  

Established targets for the KPMs are based on Management-reporting results which are currently referred to by the Company as “Underlying” results. In historical periods, these results may have been referred to as “Adjusted” or “Adjusted/Underlying” results. We believe that Underlying results, which exclude notable items, provide the best representation of our underlying financial progress toward the KPMs as the results exclude items that our Management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We have consistently shown investors our KPMs on a Management-reporting basis since our initial public offering in September of 2014. KPMs that reflect Underlying results are considered non-GAAP financial measures.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:  

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as Underlying results. In historical periods, these results may have been referred to as Adjusted or Adjusted/Underlying results. Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which Management does not consider indicative of the Company’s on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by our Management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results. The following tables present reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP.
