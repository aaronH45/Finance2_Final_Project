D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), America’s Builder, today reported that net income attributable to D.R. Horton for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 increased 52% to $287.2 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared to $188.8 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the same quarter of fiscal 2018. The prior year quarter results include the impact of a higher effective tax rate primarily due to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Homebuilding revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 6% to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion in the same quarter of fiscal 2018. Homes closed in the quarter increased 7% to 11,500 homes compared to 10,788 homes closed in the same quarter of fiscal 2018. 

Net sales orders for the first quarter ended December 31, 2018 increased 3% to 11,042 homes compared to 10,753 homes in the same quarter of the prior year and were unchanged in value at $3.2 billion. The Company’s cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders) for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 24% compared to 22% in the prior year quarter. 

The Company had 33,700 homes in inventory at December 31, 2018, and its homebuilding land and lot portfolio at December 31, 2018 was 309,400 lots, of which 42% were owned and 58% were controlled through option contracts. 

The Company ended the first quarter with $537.5 million of homebuilding unrestricted cash and a homebuilding debt to total capital ratio of 23.2%. Homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus homebuilding notes payable. 

Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, “The D.R. Horton team delivered solid results for the first fiscal quarter of 2019. Net income for the quarter increased 52% to $287.2 million on a 6% increase in consolidated revenues to $3.5 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin for the first quarter was 10.7%, and our home sales revenues increased 7%. These results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and affordable product offerings across multiple brands.

“Sales prices for both new and existing homes have increased across most of our markets over the past several years, which coupled with rising interest rates has impacted affordability and resulted in some moderation of demand for homes, particularly at higher price points. However, we continue to see good demand and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across our markets, and economic fundamentals and financing availability remain solid. We are pleased with our product offerings and positioning for the upcoming spring selling season, and we will adjust to future changes in market conditions as necessary.

"Our continued strategic focus is to consolidate market share while growing our revenues and profits, generating strong cash flows and returns and maintaining a flexible financial position. With 33,700 homes in inventory at the end of December and 309,400 lots owned and controlled, we are well-positioned for fiscal 2019 and future years.”

During the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Company acquired the homebuilding operations of Westport Homes, Classic Builders and Terramor Homes for $320.7 million.
