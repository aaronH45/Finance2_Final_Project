On January 18, 2019, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, a Maryland corporation (the “Corporation”), filed articles supplementary (the “Articles Supplementary”) to its charter (the “Charter”) with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the “Maryland Department”). The Articles Supplementary reclassified all 6,000 authorized and unissued shares of Series A Preferred Stock as authorized but unissued shares of Serial Preferred Stock without designation, with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications, and terms and conditions of redemption of undesignated Serial Preferred Stock as set forth in the Charter. The Articles Supplementary became effective upon the acceptance of the Articles Supplementary for record by the Maryland Department. Upon the effectiveness of the Articles Supplementary on January 18, 2019, the Corporation filed articles of restatement with the Maryland Department to restate the Charter to include all provisions of the Charter then in effect (the “Articles of Restatement”). There were no substantive changes to the Charter as restated in the Articles of Restatement.
