"We achieved multiple milestones in fiscal 2019 and are entering fiscal 2020 with strong momentum," said Andrew Anagnost, Autodesk president and CEO. "With less than 20 percent of our revenues coming from maintenance, we are effectively finished with our business model transition and now look forward to executing on our multi-year growth strategy. Our core design offerings and cloud-based solutions for construction, manufacturing and production are benefiting our customers as they undergo their own digital transformations, which offers an ongoing tailwind to our business. We are particularly excited about entering the new fiscal year with an unrivaled portfolio of cloud-based solutions for construction."

"With over $300 million in free cash flow for the year, we delivered well above our target and are demonstrating the cash generating power of our model," said Scott Herren, Autodesk CFO. "Fiscal 2019 was a year of solid execution as we accomplished multiple financial milestones that have positioned us well to keep driving growth in fiscal 2020 and beyond. We're exiting the business model transition with a much more predictable business at 95 percent recurring revenue and feel confident about our free cash flow goal for fiscal 2020."

Business Outlook

The following are forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties some of which are set forth below under "Safe Harbor Statement." Autodesk's business outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2020 assumes, among other things, a continuation of the current economic environment and foreign exchange currency rate environment. A reconciliation between the fiscal 2020 GAAP and non-GAAP estimates is provided below or in the tables following this press release. 

First Quarter Fiscal 2020

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________

(1) Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share excludes $0.34 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.07 for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $0.04 for acquisition related costs, and ($0.07) related to GAAP-only tax charges.

Full Year Fiscal 2020

(1) We do not expect foreign currency exchange rates or hedge gains/losses to materially impact our revenue guidance.

(2) Non-GAAP spend excludes $310 million related to stock-based compensation expense, $64 million for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and $31 million for acquisition related costs.  

(3) Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share excludes $1.39 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.28 for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $0.13 related to acquisition related costs, and ($0.21) related to GAAP-only tax charges. 

Tax Rates and Foreign Currency Hedging

The first quarter and full year fiscal 2020 outlook assume a projected annual effective tax rate of 25 percent and 18 percent for GAAP and non-GAAP results, respectively. Assumptions for the annual effective tax rate are regularly evaluated and may change based on the projected geographic mix of earnings. 

The majority of the Euro, Yen, British pound and Australian dollar denominated billings for our first quarter fiscal 2020 have been hedged. This hedging, along with deferred revenue locked-in through prior period billings hedges, will reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on our fourth quarter results. However, over an extended period of time, currency fluctuations may increasingly impact our results. We also hedge certain expenses. We hedge our net cash flow exposures using a four quarter rolling layered hedge program. As such, a portion of the projected Euro, Yen, British pound and Australian dollar denominated billings for the remainder of fiscal 2020 have been hedged. The closer to the current time period, the more we are hedged.

Glossary of Terms

Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR): Represents the annualized value of our average monthly recurring revenue for the preceding three months. "Maintenance plan ARR” captures ARR relating to traditional maintenance attached to perpetual licenses. "Subscription plan ARR" captures ARR relating to subscription offerings. Refer to the definition of recurring revenue below for more details on what is included within ARR. Recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is captured when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation.

ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our business. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. 

Annualized Revenue Per Subscription (ARPS): Is calculated by dividing our annualized recurring revenue by the total number of subscriptions.

Billings: Total revenue plus net change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period.

5

Cloud Service Offerings: Represents individual term-based offerings deployed through web browser technologies or in a hybrid software and cloud configuration. Cloud service offerings that are bundled with other product offerings are not captured as a separate cloud service offering.

Constant Currency (CC) Growth Rates: We attempt to represent the changes in the underlying business operations by eliminating fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as eliminating hedge gains or losses recorded within the current and comparative periods. We calculate constant currency growth rates by (i) applying the applicable prior period exchange rates to current period results and (ii) excluding any gains or losses from foreign currency hedge contracts that are reported in the current and comparative periods.

Core Business: Represents the combination of maintenance, product, and EBA. 

Enterprise Business Agreements (EBAs): Represents programs providing enterprise customers with token-based access or a fixed maximum number of seats to a broad pool of Autodesk products over a defined contract term.

Free Cash Flow: Cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures. 

Maintenance Plan: Our maintenance plans provide our customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts. Under our maintenance plans, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available, and technical support. We recognize maintenance revenue over the term of the agreements, generally one year. 

Other Revenue: Consists of revenue from consulting, training and other services, and is recognized over time as the services are performed. Other revenue also includes software license revenue from the sale of products which do not incorporate substantial cloud services and is recognized up front. 

Product Subscription: Provides customers the most flexible, cost-effective way to access and manage 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software tools. Our product subscriptions currently represent a hybrid of desktop and SaaS functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders.

Recurring Revenue: Consists of the revenue for the period from our traditional maintenance plans and revenue from our subscription plan offerings. It excludes subscription revenue related to consumer product offerings, select Creative Finishing product offerings, education offerings, and third party products. Recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is captured when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation.

Subscription Plan:  Comprises our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and EBAs. Subscriptions represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. With subscription, customers can use our software anytime, anywhere, and get access to the latest updates to previous versions.

Subscription Revenue: Includes subscription fees from product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and EBAs.

6

Total Deferred Revenue: Is calculated by adding together total short term, long term, and unbilled deferred revenue. 

Total Subscriptions: Consists of subscriptions from our maintenance plans and subscription plan offerings that are active and paid as of the fiscal year end date. For certain cloud service offerings and EBAs, subscriptions represent the monthly average activity reported within the last three months of the fiscal quarter end date. Total subscriptions do not include education offerings, consumer product offerings, select Creative Finishing product offerings, Autodesk Buzzsaw, Autodesk Constructware, and third party products. Subscriptions acquired with the acquisition of a business are captured once the data conforms to our subscription count methodology and when added, may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation. 

Unbilled Deferred Revenue: Unbilled deferred revenue represents contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multi-year billing plans for subscription, services and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not been recognized. Under ASC 606, unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Safe Harbor Statement

This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements in the paragraphs under “Business Outlook” above, statements regarding ARR growth acceleration, other statements about our short-term and long-term goals and targets, statements regarding the impacts and results of our business model transition, expectations regarding the transition of product offerings to subscription and acceptance by our customers and partners of subscriptions, expectations for billings, revenue, subscriptions, spend, EPS, ARR and free cash flow, and other statements regarding our strategies, market and product positions, performance and results. There are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements made in this press release, including: failure to achieve our revenue and profitability objectives; failure to successfully manage transitions to new markets; failure to maintain cost reductions or otherwise control our expenses; failure to continue to innovate to meet competitive offerings;

difficulty in predicting revenue from new businesses; general market, political, economic, and business conditions; any imposition of new tariffs or trade barriers; the impact of non-cash charges on our financial results; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates; the success of our foreign currency hedging program; our performance in particular geographies, including emerging economies; the ability of governments around the world to meet their financial and debt obligations, and finance infrastructure projects; weak or negative growth in the industries we serve; slowing momentum in subscription billings or revenues; difficulties encountered in integrating new or acquired businesses and technologies; the inability to identify and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions; the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels; dependence on and the timing of large transactions; pricing pressure; unexpected fluctuations in our annual effective tax rate; significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; the timing and degree of expected investments in growth and efficiency opportunities; changes in the timing of product releases and retirements; and any unanticipated accounting charges. Our estimates as to tax rate are based on current tax law, including current interpretations of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and could be affected by changing interpretations of that Act, as well as additional legislation and guidance around that Act.

Further information on potential factors that could affect the financial results of Autodesk are included in Autodesk's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 30, 2018, July 31, 2018, and October 31, 2018, which are on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
