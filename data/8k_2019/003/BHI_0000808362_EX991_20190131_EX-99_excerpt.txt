LONDON & HOUSTON (January 31, 2019) – Baker Hughes, a GE company (NYSE: BHGE) ("BHGE" or the "Company") announced results today for the fourth quarter and total year 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*These are non-GAAP financial measures. See section entitled "Charges and Credits" for a reconciliation from GAAP.

"F" is used in most instances when variance is above 100%. Additionally, "U" is used in most instances when variance is below (100)%.

Prior period information has been restated for the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which we adopted on January 1, 2018.

“2018 marked BHGE’s first full year as a combined company and it was a year of significant change and progress for us. We moved beyond the initial integration phase into the next chapter for BHGE. In November, our majority shareholder, GE, reduced their ownership from approximately 62.5% to approximately 50.4%, and we reached critical commercial agreements with GE that position our company for the future. The market environment changed significantly as we progressed through the year. Through these changes, we stayed focused on our priorities of gaining market share, running the company better to improve margin rates and improving cash generation. While there is more work to do, I am very pleased with how we executed for our customers and shareholders, and I am proud of what we accomplished in 2018,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, BHGE Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.

“In the fourth quarter, we achieved $6.9 billion in orders, our largest orders quarter in almost 3 years, with sequential growth in all four of our business segments. We delivered $6.3 billion in revenue and adjusted operating income in the quarter was $498 million. Free cash flow in the quarter was $876 million. 

“For the total year 2018, orders were $23.9 billion, as we re-built our backlog, and we delivered $22.9 billion of revenue, as we captured market opportunities and grew our market share. In the year, we delivered $1.4 billion of adjusted operating income. We also achieved over $800 million of synergies, ahead of our target. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion in the year, which included approximately $473 million of restructuring, legal and deal related cash outflows.

“In Oilfield Services (OFS), we made significant progress on our objectives of gaining share in key markets, being closer to our customers and expanding margin rates. In the fourth quarter, we secured several important drilling, completions and artificial lift awards in the Middle East and Latin America and continued to deliver superior performance with our leading drilling systems for customers in North America. 

“In Oilfield Equipment (OFE), our core focus in the year was to re-build backlog and set the business up for success in the coming years, and we executed very well on this plan. We saw strong orders in the fourth quarter rounding out a solid 2018. We won several important awards during the year, including 34 trees for India's Oil & Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) 98/2 project in the fourth quarter. In November, we launched Subsea Connect, a new approach to subsea development to improve the economics of offshore projects, which is gaining traction with our customers. 

“Our Turbomachinery & Process Solutions (TPS) segment saw an improved LNG market in 2018. In the fourth quarter, we secured an award to provide modular turbocompressor technology for LNG Canada’s liquefaction plant in Kitimat, British Columbia, the largest LNG project to reach a positive Final Investment Decision (FID) globally since 2014. 

"We also secured a number of key contracts in the pipeline market as demand in North America increased throughout 2018, and we continue to gain traction with our versatile lower megawatt NovaLT gas turbine product line. 

“In Digital Solutions (DS), we stayed focused on gaining traction with our digital software offerings and launched several important partnerships to enhance our offerings. We also continued our focus on growing core hardware in our measurement and controls product lines across multiple industries, including automotive and consumer electronics.

“The market dynamics in the fourth quarter demonstrated the volatility in our industry. The recent decline in crude prices will have an impact on the more transactional markets of the United States, Canada and Latin America in the first half of 2019. We expect other international markets as well as offshore activity to remain relatively stable. We are seeing a positive change in the LNG market, with likely project sanctioning accelerating faster than we previously anticipated. 

“We delivered a strong fourth quarter and finished out a solid 2018 for BHGE. I would like to thank the BHGE team for their hard work and dedication throughout the year. As we look forward to 2019, our core mission as a company is unchanged -- delivering productivity solutions to the oil and gas industry through differentiated technology and innovative commercial models. We are positioning the company to navigate a dynamic macroeconomic environment, while remaining focused on delivering for our customers and on our priorities of share, margins, and cash,” concluded Simonelli.

Quarter Highlights

Customer Wins

BHGE’s OFS segment saw continued growth across its core well construction product lines. OFS was awarded a major conventional stimulation and well-testing contract by Saudi Aramco to enhance production from new and existing wells across conventional fields in Saudi Arabia. By integrating discrete products, services and capabilities, including cased-hole wireline logging, perforation, well testing, stimulation, fracturing and associated intervention services, into a single offering, BHGE will help Saudi Aramco reduce time, costs and complexity while increasing efficiency.

The OFS team also secured a number of artificial lift and completions contracts in the Middle East, demonstrating BHGE’s commitment to the region, including two major long-term contracts in Oman to provide electrical submersible pumps, power cables for conventional and high-temperature applications, and H-pumps. The Company also installed the first fit-for-purpose liner hanger system for a customer in Saudi Arabia and signed agreements to provide intelligent production systems in the United Arab Emirates. 

In Latin America, OFS signed a four-year contract to provide drilling services, drill bits, drilling and completion fluids, cementing and completion solutions to a key customer in Colombia. Through this award, BHGE will support major drilling campaigns, develop new technology in partnership with the customer and support conventional operations. 

BHGE’s OFE segment, together with McDermott International and L&T Hydrocarbon Engineering, was awarded the subsea contract for ONGC's largest deepwater project, the development of block DWN-98/2 in the Krishna Godavari basin. This represents the single largest subsea contract ever awarded by ONGC. BHGE’s scope will include subsea hardware including 34 deepwater trees, manifolds, controls, connection systems, subsea production systems installation tools and services, flexible risers and flowlines, and umbilical and topside controls. BHGE will also provide the pre-commissioning services for additional phases of the project. The project will leverage BHGE’s existing footprint in Kakinada for ongoing services.

OFE also won a contract for four trees in the North Sea for a major international customer, building on its continued success with this important customer and in North Sea tieback projects.

BHGE’s TPS business secured an award to supply modular turbocompressor technology for LNG Canada’s liquefaction plant in Kitimat, British Columbia, representing the largest LNG project to reach a positive FID globally since 2014, and the first large-scale LNG project to use modular liquefaction trains. BHGE's LMS 100 aeroderivative gas turbine was selected to maximize efficiency and lower the carbon footprint for the project, a critical element of the final investment decision.

TPS' Pipeline & Gas Processing business secured an important win to provide turbomachinery equipment for the Coastal GasLink pipeline project in Canada, which will transport natural gas from the Dawson Creek area to a facility near Kitimat to supply LNG Canada. BHGE will supply three PGT25 Plus aeroderivative gas turbines to drive a PCL603 pipeline compressor with a total capacity of 2.1 billion cubic feet (BCF) per day.

TPS won another pipeline award to provide two NovaLT 12 gas turbines for the Istrana project in Europe, marking the first time the technology will be used for pipeline compression. The NovaLT technology was selected due to its superior efficiency and performance ratings compared to the existing technology currently used in the pipeline.

BHGE’s DS segment continues to lead in Industrial IoT software deployments. This quarter the team secured several awards for Asset Performance Management (APM) solutions from downstream customers in North America, Europe and Latin America. APM analyzes the data captured from industrial sensors to improve maintenance strategies for reduced asset downtime. The result is lower maintenance costs and overall improved reliability for the customer’s operations.

DS' industrial inspection offerings continued to gain traction in the fourth quarter, with strong growth in the aviation sector in Asia and in the automotive sector in Europe.

Technology and Innovation 

BHGE's OFE segment launched a new approach to subsea development, Subsea Connect. By combining planning and risk management, new modular deepwater technology, innovative partnerships and digital tools into a single offering, Subsea Connect can reduce the economic development point of subsea projects by an average of 30 percent and has the potential to unlock an additional 16 billion barrels of reserves globally. A cornerstone of the approach is the Aptara™ TOTEX-lite subsea system, which incorporates lightweight, modular technologies designed to make installation, production and intervention simpler and more efficient and cut the total cost of ownership in half.

TPS was selected by a customer in the Eastern Hemisphere to supply its LM9000 aeroderivative gas turbine technology for a large-scale LNG project. This marks the first time the LM9000 technology has been selected for an LNG application. This technology, which has been in development for several years, will be a key enabler to drive the project towards its final investment decision. The LM9000 is significantly more efficient, with a 50 percent increase in meantime between maintenance intervals versus current aeroderivative technology - the longest in the industry. With the ability to start in a fully pressurized condition, and 24-hour engine swap capability, the LM9000 can also reach over 99 percent availability for best-in-class total cost of ownership.

Executing for Customers 

BHGE’s OFS business continues to deliver records with its world-class drilling portfolio. In the Marcellus and Utica, BHGE’s OFS teamed up with two operators to drill the longest single-run lateral for each basin. A customer in the Marcellus used BHGE’s leading rotary steerable system and a high-performance drilling motor to drill 18,353 feet in 76.5 drilling hours. This run also achieved a mile-a-day record, drilling 5,557 feet in a 24-hour period at the beginning of the run. In the Utica, a customer achieved the longest single run lateral by drilling 19,046 feet in 138.3 drilling hours.

BHGE’s TPS business has successfully started up the third train at the Yamal LNG project one year ahead of the original schedule, enabling the plant operations to reach full capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum in less than a year since launch. This milestone reflects a strong focus on execution and working closely with the customer to address some of the world’s most challenging environmental and technical obstacles.
