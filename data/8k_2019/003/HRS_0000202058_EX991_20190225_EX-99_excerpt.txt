Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain of the matters discussed in this communication are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than historical facts may be forward-looking statements; words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “projects,” “guidance,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are made in reliance on the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Harris and L3 caution investors that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond Harris’ and L3’s control, 

that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. In addition to factors previously disclosed in Harris’ and L3’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or both of Harris and L3 to terminate the definitive merger agreement between Harris and L3; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Harris, L3, or their respective directors; the risk that the stockholder approvals of Harris or L3 may not be obtained on the expected schedule or at all; the ability to obtain regulatory approvals and satisfy other closing conditions to the merger in a timely manner or at all, including the risk that regulatory approvals required for the merger are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; delay in closing the merger; difficulties and delays in integrating the Harris and L3 businesses or fully realizing anticipated cost savings and other benefits; business disruptions from the proposed merger that may harm Harris’ and L3’s businesses, including current plans and operations; any announcement relating to the proposed transaction could have adverse effects on the ability of Harris or L3 to retain and hire key personnel or maintain relationships with suppliers and customers, including the U.S. government and other governments, or on Harris’ or L3’s operating results and businesses generally; the risk that the announcement of the proposed transaction could have adverse effects on the market price of the common stock of either or both of Harris’ and L3’s common stock and the uncertainty as to the long-term value of the common stock of the combined company following the merger; certain restrictions during the pendency of the merger that may impact Harris’ or L3’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which Harris and L3 operate; and events beyond Harris’ and L3’s control, such as acts of terrorism. The foregoing list of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in forward-looking statements is not exhaustive. Further information relating to factors that may impact the parties’ results and forward-looking statements are disclosed in their respective filings with the SEC.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this communication or as of the date they were made, and neither Harris nor L3 undertakes any obligation to update forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, also see the information under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Harris’ and L3’s most recent reports on Form 10-K for the years ended June 29, 2018 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and any material updates to these factors contained in any of Harris’ and L3’s subsequent and future filings.

As for the forward-looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections, actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected and such differences could be material. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results. Given these uncertainties, persons receiving this communication should not place any reliance on these forward-looking statements.
