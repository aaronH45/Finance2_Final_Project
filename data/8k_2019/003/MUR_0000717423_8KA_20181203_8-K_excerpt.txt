EXPLANATORY NOTE  

 As previously disclosed in its Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on December 3, 2018 (the Original Form 8-K), on November 30, 2018, Murphy Exploration & Production Company – USA (Murphy), a wholly owned subsidiary of Murphy Oil Corporation (the Company), and Petrobras America Inc. (PAI), a subsidiary of Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., entered into a transaction pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement), dated as of October 10, 2018, among Murphy, PAI and MP Gulf of Mexico, LLC (MP GOM), a limited liability company previously 100% owned by Murphy. The Transaction has an effective date of October 1, 2018.   

 Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Murphy contributed its interests in the Dalmatian, Clipper, Front Runner, Habanero, Kodiak, Tahoe, Thunder Hawk, and Medusa fields and its interest in the Medusa Spar LLC to MP GOM, and PAI contributed its interests in the Cascade, Chinook, Lucius, St. Malo, Cottonwood, South Marsh Island, Northwestern, and South Hadrian fields and its interests in exploration blocks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to MP GOM. Murphy also paid cash consideration of $900 million, subject to normal closing adjustments, to PAI on behalf of MP GOM. Additionally, PAI can earn an additional contingent consideration up to $150 million if certain price and production thresholds are exceeded beginning in 2019 through 2025. Also, Murphy will carry $50 million of PAI costs in the St. Malo field if certain enhanced oil recovery projects are undertaken. As a result of the transaction, PAI received a 20% membership interest in MP GOM, and Murphy’s membership interest in MP GOM was reduced to 80%. Murphy controls the operations of MP GOM, subject to certain PAI minority rights. In addition, Murphy is the contract operator of MP GOM’s assets. Murphy funded the transaction through a combination of cash-on-hand and its senior credit facility.
