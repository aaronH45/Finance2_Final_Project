With Revenue Growth and Margin Expansion Across All Segments

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

___________________________________________________________________________________________

MELBOURNE, Fla., January 29, 2019 — Harris Corporation (NYSE:HRS) reported fiscal 2019 second quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, up 9% compared with the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share (EPS) from continuing operations increased 74% to $1.88, and non-GAAP EPS1 increased 19% to $1.96. Net income increased 72% to $225 million, and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT2) increased 18% to $327 million with margin expansion of 150 basis points (bps).

"We delivered the third straight quarter of high single-digit revenue growth and generated record EPS with strong margin expansion across all three segments," said William M. Brown, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "First half revenue growth of 9%, book-to-bill of 1.17 and margin expansion of 90 bps give us confidence to increase our revenue and EPS guidance for the second time this fiscal year." 

"Integration planning for the merger with L3 is progressing well, with the integration team fully staffed and developing detailed plans to deliver $500 million of cost synergies and ensure seamless operations post close. We continue to expect the transaction to close in mid-2019."

Summary Financial Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue increased 9% for the quarter and the first half, with solid growth across all three segments. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS3 grew double digits for the quarter and the first half driven by higher volume, strong operational performance and a lower share count. A lower tax rate also contributed to first half EPS growth. In addition, GAAP EPS increased due to the absence of a one-time write down of deferred tax assets and an adjustment for deferred compensation recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by L3 deal and integration costs in the current quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.06 for the second quarter and 1.17 for the first half. 

Communication Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Second quarter revenue increased 10% from strong growth in all three businesses. Tactical Communications revenue grew 9%, with International up 11% from solid growth in Asia Pacific and Europe, and DoD up 7% on modernization demand. Night Vision and PSPC grew double digits as strong orders continued to convert into revenue. Operating income grew 12%, and margin expanded 50 bps to 30.0% from volume leverage and operational efficiencies, partially offset by mix. Orders were up 33% resulting in a segment book-to-bill of 1.18.

3 Excludes discontinued operations and L3 deal and integration costs; reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the

 attached tables.

Tactical Communications orders grew 27% driven by DoD modernization, content growth in the adjacent airborne market and international programs to counter evolving threats. Key awards included $75 million from the U.S. Marine Corps for MUOS software upgrades on 117G manpack radios and a $66 million order for Small Tactical Terminals supporting domestic and international airborne platforms. 

Public Safety continued to strengthen its position with state and federal agencies and utilities with a $33 million order from Nevada as part of a $108 million program to upgrade the statewide shared radio system; a $23 million order from the Air National Guard as it continues to adopt Harris converged radios; and $25 million from American Electric Power, the third award in its $106 million multi-year modernization program.

First half segment revenue increased 12% from double-digit growth in all three businesses. Operating margin expanded 90 bps to 29.9%. Segment book-to-bill was strong at 1.28. Tactical Communications book-to-bill was 1.32 with funded backlog greater than $1.1 billion.

Electronic Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue increased for the seventh consecutive quarter, up 6%, primarily from growth in Avionics on increased F-35 production and in Electronic Warfare from the F/A-18, F-16 and rotary platforms. Operating income grew 21% to $117 million, and margin expanded 230 bps to 19.0% driven by operational excellence and the absence of prior-year contract adjustments in Mission Networks. Orders were up 12% in the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.13. 

Harris continued to strengthen its position in electronic warfare and avionics on long-term platforms. The company received contracts totaling $115 million to upgrade electronic warfare systems on international F-16s for Poland and Iraq. These awards are under the previously announced $400 million sole-source IDIQ and follow similar awards received for Turkey and Morocco. The company also received $71 million in orders for F-35 avionics components under LRIP 12-14. 

In addition to awards on long-term platforms, Harris leveraged its expertise in avionics open systems and was awarded a contract to develop the mission processor for a large military unmanned aerial vehicle and a new trainer aircraft. Each of these awards comes with significant follow-on opportunity.

First half segment revenue was up 7% driven by double-digit growth on F-35, F/A-18 and F-16 platforms. Operating margin expanded 90 bps driven by strong execution. Segment book-to-bill was strong at 1.18.

Space and Intelligence Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Second quarter revenue increased 11% as double-digit growth from classified programs, driven by small satellites, exquisite systems and ground-based adjacencies, was partially offset by expected lower revenue from environmental programs. Operating income increased 15% to $92 million from higher volume and strong program execution. Orders increased 51%, and strong customer relationships and investments in innovation led to strategic, long-term program wins:

•$218 million follow-on award from the U.S. Army to configure, maintain and monitor the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System

•$195 million to develop the Optical Telescope Assembly for the WFIRST program, one of NASA's top-priority, large-scale missions

•$115 million classified space award to provide next-generation technology for a long-standing franchise

•$80 million from the Space Enterprise Consortium to develop next-generation GPS and space antenna technology for an experimental satellite with significant follow-on opportunities

In addition, Harris had its most active launch quarter to date:

•Three small satellites, including the first Harris small satellite (HSAT), showcasing the company's ability to provide end-to-end mission solutions for the fast-growing small satellite market

•GPS SV01, the first of 10 navigational payloads under the U.S. Air Force's GPS III satellite program 

•Two international launches: GOSAT-2 for Japan's Ministry of the Environment and GEO-KOMPSAT-2 for the Korea Aerospace Research Institute

First half segment revenue increased 8% as double-digit growth from classified programs was partially offset by expected lower revenue from environmental programs. Operating income increased 7% on higher volume, partially offset by increased investments in innovation. Book-to-bill remained strong at 1.05.

Cash and Capital Deployment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the first half of fiscal 2019, Harris generated $409 million in adjusted free cash flow5 and returned $363 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including free cash flow for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2019, in each case excluding cash flow for capital expenditures; adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2019 and expected adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2019, in each case excluding cash flow for capital expenditures and L3 deal and integration costs; free cash flow for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018, in each case excluding cash flow for capital expenditures; earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2019 and expected earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for fiscal 2019, in each case excluding L3 deal and integration costs; earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018, in each case excluding non-cash charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from a write-down of deferred tax assets and from an adjustment for deferred compensation; adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) and adjusted EBIT margin for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2019, in each case excluding, as applicable, net interest expense, income taxes, discontinued operations net of income taxes and L3 deal and integration costs; and adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT margin for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018, in each case excluding, as applicable, net interest expense, income taxes, discontinued operations net of income taxes, and a non-cash charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from an adjustment for deferred compensation. A “non-GAAP financial measure” is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future performance that excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Harris management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. Harris management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze Harris business trends and to understand Harris performance. In addition, Harris may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND REGULATION G DISCLOSURE

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we provide additional measures of income from continuing operations per diluted common share, net income, net income margin and net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted to exclude certain costs, charges, expenses and losses or other amounts. Harris management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. Harris management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze Harris’ business trends and to understand Harris’ performance. In addition, Harris may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in its forecasting, budgeting, and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP.
