Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition 

On January 23, 2019, Abbott Laboratories announced its results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2018. 

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others, net earnings from continuing operations excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as expenses primarily associated with acquisitions and restructuring actions, charges related to cost reduction initiatives, the recognition of a gain associated with the sale of the Medical Optics business, the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform, costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt, charges related to impairment of certain assets, and tax benefits associated with specified items and share-based compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs, similar to how Abbott’s management internally assesses performance. Abbott’s management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott’s results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott’s management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
