Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On February 5, 2019, the Board of Directors of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company), following the recommendation of its Compensation Committee, approved the Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Annual Incentive Plan (the AIP). The AIP, which is based on and replaces the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan for fiscal years 2014 through 2018, reflects the repeal of the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

The AIP, which will be administered by the Compensation Committee, is effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2019, and will remain in effect until terminated by the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors. The purpose of the AIP is to provide the framework for annual cash incentive award opportunities for the Company’s senior executives. Under the AIP, the Compensation Committee will establish the performance goals applicable for the plan year and designate each participant’s target award within the first 90 days of the plan year. The AIP provides that no participant may receive an annual award exceeding $5 million for a given year. 

All of our executive officers are participants in the AIP for 2019. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the AIP, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
