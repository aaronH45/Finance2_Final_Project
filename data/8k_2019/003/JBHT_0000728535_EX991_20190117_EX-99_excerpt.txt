  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

LOWELL, Ark., January 17, 2019 - J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., (NASDAQ:JBHT) announced fourth quarter 2018 net earnings of $88.7 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.81 vs. fourth quarter 2017 net earnings of $385.3 million, or $3.48 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2018 net earnings included pre-announced pretax charges of $134.0 million for contingent liabilities related to the ongoing arbitration with BNSF Railway Company. Fourth quarter 2017 net earnings included $38.9 million pre-tax charges for reserve increases on certain outstanding receivables and insurance claims as well as a $309.2 million decrease in income taxes as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted during that quarter. 

Total operating revenue for the current quarter was $2.32 billion, compared with $1.99 billion for the fourth quarter 2017. A 16% increase in revenue per load in Intermodal (JBI) contributed to a 15% increase in segment revenue. Dedicated Contract Services (DCS) segment revenue increased by 25%, primarily from the addition of new customer accounts and improved asset utilization. Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS) segment revenue increased by 7% primarily from a 14% increase in load growth. Truck (JBT) segment revenue increased 21% primarily from customer rate per mile increases. Current quarter total operating revenue, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 15% vs. the comparable quarter 2017. 

Operating income for the current quarter decreased to $122.7 million vs. $145.8 million for the fourth quarter 2017. The benefit from increased revenues was partly offset with cost increases in rail purchase transportation, inclusive of the $134.0 million contingent liability charge, increased driver wages, increased independent contractor rates per mile including outsourced intermodal dray, increased driver and independent contractor recruiting costs, and higher salary and wage expenses for non-driving personnel. Fourth quarter 2017 operating income included $38.9 million in charges for reserve increases on certain outstanding receivables and insurance claims. 

Net earnings decreased to $88.7 million in the current quarter from $385.3 million in 2017, primarily due to the $309.2 million benefit from estimating the effect of the change in future tax rates on deferred tax balances at December 31, 2017. The fourth quarter effective tax rates for 2018 and 2017 were 20.47% and (175.65)%, respectively. The annual effective tax rates for 2018 and 2017 were 23.6% and (15.29)%, respectively. 

Segment Information:  

Intermodal (JBI)  

 ■ Fourth quarter 2018 Segment Revenue: $1.26 billion; up 15%  

 ■ Fourth quarter 2018 Operating Income: $32.4 million; down 65%   

JBI total volumes declined 1% over the same period in 2017. Eastern network loads grew at 5% and transcontinental loads decreased 4% compared to the fourth quarter 2017. Revenue increased 15%, reflecting a 16% increase in revenue per load, the combination of freight mix, customer rate increases, and fuel surcharges, offset by the 1% decline in volume. Revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 15% compared to a year ago. 

Operating income decreased 65% from the prior year. Benefits from customer rate increases were offset by the $134 million pre-announced charges for contingent liabilities related to the ongoing arbitration, increased costs to attract and retain drivers, higher third-party dray costs, and increased costs due to inefficiencies in the rail networks due to congestion and service delays. In fourth quarter 2017, JBI recorded $28.7 million in charges from reserve increases on certain receivables and insurance claims. The current period ended with approximately 94,900 units of trailing capacity and approximately 5,650 power units in the dray fleet. 

Dedicated Contract Services (DCS) 

 ■ Fourth quarter 2018 Segment Revenue: $596 million; up 25%  

 ■ Fourth quarter 2018 Operating Income: $59.4 million; up 70%   

DCS revenue increased 25% during the current quarter over the same period 2017. Productivity (revenue per truck per week) increased approximately 7% vs. 2017. Productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased approximately 5% from a year ago primarily from customer rate increases, improved integration of assets between customer accounts, and increased customer supply chain fluidity. Included in the DCS revenue growth, Final Mile Services (FMS) recorded an increase in revenue of $17 million compared to fourth quarter 2017. A net additional 1,388 revenue producing trucks, 458 net additions sequentially from third quarter 2018, were in the fleet by the end of the quarter. Approximately 32% of these additions represent private fleet conversions and 5% represent FMS versus traditional dedicated capacity fleets. Customer retention rates remain above 98%. 

Operating income increased by 70% from a year ago. The increase in productivity and additional trucks under contract was partially offset by increased costs expanding the FMS network, increased driver wages and increased driver recruiting costs including the length of time to fill open positions compared to the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter 2017 operating income included $7.6 million of charges for certain insurance and claims reserve increases. 

Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS) 

 ● Fourth Quarter 2018 Segment Revenue: $345 million; up 7%  

 ● Fourth Quarter 2018 Operating Income:  $16.1 million; up 43%   

ICS revenue increased 7% in the current quarter vs. the fourth quarter 2017. Volume increased 14% but revenue per load decreased 6.4%, mostly due to customer mix changes and decreased spot market activity, compared to the prior year. Contractual volumes represent approximately 71% of the total load volume and 53% of the total revenue in the current quarter compared to 66% and 46%, respectively, in fourth quarter 2017. Of the total reported ICS revenue, approximately $174 million was executed through the Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 compared to $151 million in third quarter 2018. 

Operating income increased 43% over the same period in 2017. Gross profit margin increased to 16.9% in the current period from 14.1% last year primarily from customer rate increases on contractual volumes. The increase in gross profit margin was partially offset by higher personnel costs, increased insurance and claims costs, and higher technology spending as the Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 expands capacity and adds functionality. ICS recorded a $1.8 million charge for increased reserves on certain insurance claims in the fourth quarter 2017. ICS’s carrier base increased 29% and the employee count increased 20% from a year ago. 

Truck (JBT) 

 ■ Fourth quarter 2018 Segment Revenue: $118 million; up 21%  

 ■ Fourth quarter 2018 Operating Income:  $14.7 million; up 131%    

JBT revenue increased 21% from the same period in 2017. Revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 21% compared to a year ago. Revenue per load increased 10% primarily from an 18% increase in rates per loaded mile offset by a 6% decrease in length of haul compared to fourth quarter 2017. Comparable contractual customer rates increased approximately 15% compared to the same period a year ago. At the end of the period, JBT operated 2,112 tractors compared to 2,032 a year ago. 

Operating income increased 131% from fourth quarter 2017. Favorable changes from higher rates per loaded mile and lower equipment ownership costs were partially offset by higher driver wages and independent contractor costs per mile and higher driver and independent contractor recruiting costs compared to fourth quarter 2017. JBT recorded approximately $0.7 million of the charges for increased reserves on certain insurance claims in the fourth quarter 2017.
