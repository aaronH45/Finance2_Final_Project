2019 Outlook and Guidance

"We expect our businesses to continue their solid execution in 2019 benefitting from niche market leadership positions and high levels of recurring revenue," said Mr. Hunn. "Our strong balance sheet and pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities position us well to continue compounding cash flow in 2019.”

Roper expects full year adjusted DEPS of $12.00 - $12.40 with first quarter adjusted DEPS between $2.74 and $2.80.

The Company’s guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures and includes the impact of the previously announced Scientific Imaging divestiture to Teledyne Technologies, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. The pending Gatan divestiture is still subject to U.K. regulatory review and the Company’s guidance assumes the transaction will close in the second half of 2019.
