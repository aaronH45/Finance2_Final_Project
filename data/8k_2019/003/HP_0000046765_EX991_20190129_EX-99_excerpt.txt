 NEWS RELEASE  

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: January 29, 2019  

 HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2019 RESULTS  

   ·    Quarterly U.S. Land revenue days (activity) increased approximately 4% 

   ·    Quarterly U.S. Land adjusted average rig revenue increased by more than $800(1) per day, up approximately 3% sequentially 

   ·    H&P upgraded/converted 14 FlexRigs® to super-spec(2) capacity during the first fiscal quarter of 2019 

   ·    H&P’s U.S. Land contracted rig count increased by 12 rigs to 244 rigs from September 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018  

   ·    On December 14, 2018, Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.71 per share 

 Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) reported income of $19 million or $0.17 per diluted share from operating revenues of $741 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared to income of $2.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, on revenues of $697 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. Net income per diluted share for the first fiscal quarter of 2019 and the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 include $(0.25) and $(0.17), respectively, of after-tax losses comprised of select items(3). For the first fiscal quarter select items(3) were comprised of:  

   ·    $0.20 of after-tax gains related to early termination, gains on sales, certain discrete tax items and gains from discontinued operations related to currency fluctuations 

   ·    $(0.45) of after-tax losses related to abandonments and accelerated depreciation, bond exchange fees, a lawsuit settlement and a non-cash fair market adjustment to our equity investments 

 Net cash provided by operating activities was $209 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $186 million for the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2018.   

 President and CEO John Lindsay commented, “The Company delivered sequentially improved operational results in the face of falling crude oil prices, which decreased by more than 30% during the quarter. Customer demand for super-spec rigs continued during the first fiscal quarter and H&P responded by upgrading and converting 14 more rigs to super-spec capacity bringing our total number of super-spec FlexRigs to 221 at calendar year-end. Additionally, H&P’s FlexAppTM solutions gained further traction in the market as more customers are realizing the value these software-based drilling applications create.

 “Predictably, demand for super-spec rigs this current quarter has softened largely due to oil price uncertainty and our customers’ aim to spend within cash flow. Even with the softening outlook, the Company’s large offering of highly capable super-spec FlexRigs and the associated technology surrounding wellbore quality and placement becomes more critical as drilling in the U.S.’s most prolific basins increases in complexity.  

 “The newly created H&P Technologies segment, which encompasses H&P’s technology-based subsidiaries, Motive and MagVar, also saw increased demand during the quarter. Individually or combined with the FlexRig, our wellbore quality and placement technologies greatly enhance the economic potential of a well and add significant value to our customers and their stakeholders. The Company’s drilling automation technology, AutoSlideSM, continues to gain momentum and interest from customers and we anticipate commercialization in the Midland Basin over the next few months.”  

 Vice President and CFO Mark Smith also commented, “This recent lack of clear direction in crude prices is injecting an amount of uncertainty into some of our customers’ drilling plans for 2019. H&P, like our customers, has responded accordingly. H&P is slowing the cadence of super-spec upgrades creating a commensurate reduction in our planned capital expenditures for the year.   

 “We have reduced our budgeted capex by over 20%, approximately $150 million from our initial budget. As in the past with volatile markets, the Company will maintain a disciplined capital allocation strategy and we remain confident that our operational results and financial strength will support that strategy.”  

 John Lindsay concluded, “The Company’s ability to plan, adapt and respond in a near-term volatile market is one of the cornerstones of our long-term success. Despite industry conditions, the primary focus remains constant at H&P - to partner with our customers and add value through our people, the FlexRig fleet and technologies to achieve common goals.”  

 Operating Segment Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2019  

 U.S. Land Operations:  

 Segment operating income increased by $15.1 million to $79.7 million sequentially. The increase in operating results was primarily driven by sequential increases in both quarterly revenue days and average rig revenue per day. The number of quarterly revenue days increased sequentially by approximately 4%. Adjusted average rig revenue per day improved by $835 or roughly 3% to $25,156(1) as average dayrates increased during the quarter.   

 The average rig expense per day increased sequentially by $1,334 to $15,443 as the quarter was negatively impacted by $821 of costs associated with a settled lawsuit while the prior quarter benefited from favorable adjustments to self-insurance expenses. Corresponding adjusted average rig margin per day increased $322 to $10,534(1).   

 The segment’s depreciation expense for the quarter includes non-cash charges of $3.5 million for abandonments and accelerated depreciation of used drilling rig components related to rig upgrades, compared to similar non-cash charges of $13.9 million during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018.

 Offshore Operations:  

 Segment operating income decreased by $1.0 million to $7.2 million sequentially. The number of quarterly revenue days on H&P-owned platform rigs decreased sequentially by approximately 5%, while the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially by $1,454 to $9,998 primarily due to a rig undergoing maintenance during the quarter. Management contracts on customer-owned platform rigs contributed approximately $5.4 million to the segment’s operating income, compared to approximately $5.5 million during the prior quarter.   

 International Land Operations:  

 The segment had operating income of $6.6 million this quarter as compared to an operating loss of $7.9 million during the previous quarter. The $14.5 million sequential increase in operating income was primarily attributable to asset impairments charges related to ceasing operations in Ecuador that adversely impacted the prior quarter combined with an installment payment related to prior early terminations that benefitted first fiscal quarter revenues. Revenue days decreased during the quarter by 3% to 1,758 while the adjusted average rig margin per day increased by $1,524 to $10,182(1).   

 H&P Technologies:  

 The segment had an operating loss of $10.3 million this quarter as compared to an operating loss of $15.6 million during the previous quarter. The $5.3 million sequential decrease in the operating loss was due in part to the impairment of legacy TerraVici intangible assets that negatively impacted the prior quarter.   

 Operational Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2019  

 U.S. Land Operations:  

   ·    Quarterly revenue days expected to decrease by approximately 3%-5% sequentially representing a roughly 1%-3% decrease in the average number of active rigs given the lower number of calendar days during the second fiscal quarter and implying a likely exit to the quarter at between 223-233 active rigs 

   ·    Average rig revenue per day expected to be between $25,500-$26,000 (excluding any impact from early termination revenue) 

   ·    Average rig expense per day expected to be between $14,700-$15,100 

 Offshore Operations:  

   ·    Quarterly revenue days expected to increase by approximately 3% sequentially, representing an average rig count of 6 rigs for the quarter as one rig returns from planned maintenance on its offshore platform partially offset by the lower number of calendar day during the second fiscal quarter 

   ·    Average rig margin per day expected to be approximately $6,000-$7,000 as one rig is expected to be on a standby rate for the quarter 

   ·    Management contracts expected to generate approximately $4-$5 million in operating income as one of the rigs moves to a reduced cold stack rate as planned 

 International Land Operations:  

   ·    Quarterly revenue days expected to be down approximately 10% sequentially primarily due to reduced activity in Colombia and the lower number of calendar days during the second fiscal quarter, representing an average rig count of 17-18 rigs for the quarter 

   ·    Average rig margin per day expected to be roughly $10,500-$11,500

 Segment operating income for all segments is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company’s performance, as it excludes general and administrative expenses, corporate depreciation, income from asset sales, and other corporate income and expense. The Company considers segment operating income to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company’s core businesses. This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company’s reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods. The Company believes that segment operating income is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers. Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons. However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company’s operating performance in future periods.  

 The following table reconciles operating income (loss) per the information above to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands).  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 “As Adjusted” – Effective October 1, 2018, we implemented organizational changes, consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources. Certain operations previously reported in “other” within our segment disclosures are now managed and presented within the new H&P Technologies reportable segment. All segment disclosures have been recast for these segment changes. Additionally, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits – (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 has been adjusted to reflect changes that were applied retrospectively from that adoption.
