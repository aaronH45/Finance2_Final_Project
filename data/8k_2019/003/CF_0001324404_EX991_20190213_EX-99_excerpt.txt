Overview of Results

CF Industries Holdings, Inc. today announced fourth quarter and full year 2018 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $49 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, and $290 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, respectively. These results are not directly comparable to 2017 results given the impact on the 2017 periods from the U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Fourth quarter and full year 2017 net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $465 million, or $1.98 per diluted share(2), and $358 million, or $1.53 per diluted share(2), respectively. 

The company announced fourth quarter and full year 2018 EBITDA of $349 million and $1,429 million, respectively; and fourth quarter and full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $341 million and $1,403 million, respectively. These results are directly comparable to 2017 results as they were not impacted by the U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Fourth quarter and full year 2017 EBITDA were $224 million and $856 million, respectively; and fourth quarter and full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA were $260 million and $969 million, respectively. 

"We delivered strong results in 2018, as higher global nitrogen prices and lower natural gas costs drove a 45 percent increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to 2017," said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. “With strong nitrogen demand anticipated in North America during the first half of 2019, our in-region production and extensive transportation and distribution network position us well to build on our 2018 performance.

“Longer-term, our outlook remains positive: we are positioned at the low end of the global cost curve due to our access to low-cost North American natural gas, we continue to operate exceptionally well and we expect the global nitrogen supply and demand balance to continue to tighten."

(1) EBITDA is defined as net earnings attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense-net, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. See reconciliations of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release.

(2) Fourth quarter and full year 2017 net earnings attributable to common stockholders included a $491 million income tax benefit from the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which impacted diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders by $2.09 and $2.10 for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively.

Operations Overview

CF Industries continued operating safely and efficiently during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the company's 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0.60 incidents per 200,000 work hours despite increased turnaround and maintenance activity compared to 2017.

Sales Overview

Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $1,132 million and for the full year 2018 were $4,429 million compared to $1,099 million and $4,130 million in the same periods last year. The increases were due primarily to higher average selling prices across all segments. 

Total sales volumes for the fourth quarter and full year were lower compared to the same periods in 2017 as lower ammonia and ammonium nitrate sales volume was partially offset by higher granular urea sales volume. 

Average selling prices for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 were higher year-over-year across all segments as higher energy costs in Asia and Europe, along with continued enforcement of environmental regulations in China, resulted in lower production in these regions, tightening the global supply and demand balance. 

Cost of sales for the full year 2018 decreased compared to the full year 2017 driven by lower sales volume and lower realized gas costs partially offset by higher costs related to plant turnarounds and maintenance. The company also recorded an unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $13 million for the full year 2018 compared to an unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives of $61 million for the full year 2017. 

For the full year 2018, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the company's cost of sales was $3.16 per MMBtu, which included a realized loss of $0.01 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges. This compares to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $3.40 per MMBtu for the full year 2017, which included a realized loss of $0.07 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges. During 2018, the average price of natural gas at Henry Hub in North America was $3.12 per MMBtu, and the average price of natural gas at the National Balancing Point in the United Kingdom was $8.07 per MMBtu.

Market Overview

Global nitrogen prices reached in-year highs early in the fourth quarter of 2018, and then declined through the end of the year and into 2019 due to seasonally low demand in the Northern Hemisphere and moderating energy prices in Asia and Europe. As demand in the Northern Hemisphere begins to materialize, industry fundamentals should be supportive of global nitrogen prices in the first half of 2019. 

In North America, the company expects strong nitrogen fertilizer demand during the first half of 2019. Corn and wheat plantings in the United States are projected to increase by four million and one million acres, respectively, compared to 2018. Additionally, unfavorable weather limited fall ammonia applications in the Midwest United States, suggesting a nitrogen deficit in many areas that will need to be made up by applications of ammonia or upgraded products during the first half of 2019.

India and Brazil, two of the largest urea-importing regions in the world, will continue to be key global demand centers. Urea imports into India and Brazil in 2018 totaled 6.3 million metric tons and 5.5 million metric tons, respectively. The company expects total Indian and Brazilian urea import requirements to be in a similar range in 2019. 

 2 

The company projects net global urea production capacity to increase by 3.5 million metric tons during 2019, below the historical nitrogen demand growth rate of two percent. However, 1.2 million metric tons of this new urea production capacity in Iran that is included in the company’s projection is at risk of delay due to United States sanctions on Iran. 

China's role in globally traded urea continued to shrink in 2018, with exports totaling approximately 2.4 million metric tons. Published reports suggest this volume may include substantial re-exports of Iranian urea. Chinese urea exports are expected to be in a similar volume range in 2019 due to continued firm energy prices and tighter environmental restrictions. 

The company continues to monitor the impact of sanctions on Iran. Urea from Iranian producers is available at a significant discount to global prices with few regions of the world open to purchasing from that country due to sanctions. Iranian producers will face additional challenges should the sanctions continue due to the loss of access to technical expertise, replacement parts for current plants and resources to support new construction.

Longer-term, industry and energy market fundamentals are expected to continue to support the global nitrogen cost curve at higher levels. Net global urea supply growth through 2022 is projected to fall short of the historical nitrogen demand annual growth rate of approximately two percent, further tightening the global supply and demand balance.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be $400-$450 million. 

Liquidity

As of December 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $682 million on the balance sheet, had no borrowings outstanding under its $750 million revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under its debt instruments. 

During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 9.1 million shares for $409 million. As of December 31, 2018, the company had repurchased 10.9 million shares for $500 million, completing the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in August 2018.

Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program through 2021.

CHS Inc. Distribution

On January 31, 2019, the Board of Managers of CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) approved a semi-annual distribution payment to CHS Inc. (CHS) of $86 million for the distribution period ended December 31, 2018. The distribution was paid on January 31, 2019. The total distribution to CHS pertaining to 2018 was approximately $165 million.
