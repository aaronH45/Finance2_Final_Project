Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement  

Amendment No. 3 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement  

On February 25, 2019, Lam Research Corporation (the “Company”) entered into Amendment No. 3 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”), which further amends the Company’s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 10, 2015 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented and/or otherwise modified from time to time prior to the effective date of the Amendment, the “Existing Credit Agreement” and, as amended by the Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent.  

Among other things, the Amendment eliminates the minimum liquidity requirement and replaces the capitalization covenant included in the Existing Credit Agreement with a leverage covenant. The leverage covenant requires the Company to maintain, as determined as of the end of each of its fiscal quarters ending on and after December 23, 2018 and through maturity, a Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio for the four fiscal quarter period then ended of no more than 3.50 to 1.00. Other than as disclosed in this paragraph, the material terms of the Credit Agreement are substantially the same as the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement.  

The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be a complete description of its terms and is qualified in all respects by reference to the complete text of the Amendment, a copy of which is being filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.  

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant  

The disclosure under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference in response to this Item 2.03.
