 This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Anadarko believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. No assurance, however, can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, anticipated results, or other expectations expressed in this presentation, including Anadarko’s ability to successfully execute upon its capital program; to efficiently identify and deploy capital resource; to meet financial and operating guidance and achieve the production growth, cash flow levels and returns identified in this presentation; to successfully complete the transaction identified in this presentation and realize the expected benefits; to timely complete and commercially operate the projects, infrastructure and drilling prospects identified in this presentation; to successfully drill, complete, test and produce the wells identified in this presentation; to successfully complete the share-repurchase and debt-reduction programs; evaluate dividend increases; to achieve further drilling cost reductions, efficiencies and market improvements; to successfully plan, secure additional government and partner approvals, enter into long-term sales contracts, take FID and the timing thereof, finance, build, achieve expected cost savings, and operate the necessary infrastructure and LNG park in Mozambique. See “Risk Factors” in the company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other public filings and press releases. Anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Please see the appendix slides or our website at www.anadarko.com under “Investor Relations” for reconciliations of the differences between any non-GAAP financial measure used in this presentation and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Cautionary Note to Investors - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC’s definitions for such terms. We may use terms in this presentation, such as “resources,” “net resources,” “net recoverable resources,” and similar terms that the SEC’s guidelines strictly prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These quantities may not constitute "reserves" within the meaning of the SEC’s rules. EUR estimates and drilling locations have not been risked by our management. Actual quantities that may be ultimately recovered from our interests may differ substantially. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of our ongoing drilling program, which will be directly affected by commodity prices, the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling risks, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors; and our actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates. Such estimates may change significantly as development of our oil and gas assets provide additional data. U.S. Investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, File No. 001-08968, available from us at www.anadarko.com or by writing to us at: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, 1201 Lake Robbins Drive, The Woodlands, Texas 77380 Attn: Investor Relations.

 Divested Sales-Volume Summary  

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures; Management Estimates & Assumptions This list of non-GAAP financial measure definitions and related reconciliations is intended to satisfy the requirements of Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any non-GAAP financial measure definitions or related reconciliation. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain amounts that are included in the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The following slides include reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures and statements indicating why management believes the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information for investors. This non-GAAP information should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures. Non-GAAP financial measures provided in this presentation for specific asset areas are calculated using the same methodology as the consolidated measure. Corporate general and administrative expenses are included in consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin), but excluded from EBITDAX and EBITDA by asset area as these expenses are not considered an operating expense of the asset area. Corporate expenses and income taxes are included in consolidated FCF, but excluded from FCF by asset area as these items are not allocated to specific asset areas. Management has presented herein certain estimates about future performance, results, and financial position. Such estimates generally reflect current or explicitly assumed future commodity strip prices as well as management's assumptions about future drilling plans, performance, and production mix, among other factors. These forward-looking estimates are illustrative and are not intended to reflect the results we will achieve for the periods presented. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates presented herein. Management has also presented herein certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin), EBITDAX, EBITDA, DCF, Adjusted DCF, FCF, and adjusted FCF. Due to the forward-looking nature of the aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures, management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures, such as future impairments and future changes in working capital. Accordingly, the company is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures. Reconciling items in future periods could be significant.  

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) / Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA) The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A); exploration expense; gains (losses) on divestitures, net; impairments; total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives; restructuring charges; and (gains) losses on early extinguishment of debt. The Company’s definition of Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) excludes gains (losses) on divestitures, net and exploration expense as they are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. DD&A and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) as a measure of operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of operating results without regard to Anadarko’s financing methods or capital structure. Finally, income tax expense (benefit) and total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) because these items are not considered a measure of asset operating performance. For Midstream assets, the Company refers to this measure as EBITDA because exploration expense is not relevant. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) provides information useful in assessing the Company’s operating and financial performance across periods. Years Ended December 31, millions 2018 2017 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP) $ 615 $ (456 ) Interest expense 947 932 Income tax expense (benefit) 733 (1,477 ) Depreciation, depletion and amortization 4,254 4,279 Exploration expense 459 2,535 (Gains) losses on divestitures, net (20 ) (674 ) Impairments 800 408 Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives (407 ) 156 Restructuring charges 53 21 (Gains) Losses on early extinguishment of debt (2 ) 2 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) (Non-GAAP) $ 7,432 $ 5,726 Total Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE) 243 245 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) per BOE (Non-GAAP) $ 30.58 $ 23.37  

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Discretionary Cash Flow from Operations (DCF) and Free Cash Flow (FCF) The Company defines DCF as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in accounts receivable; changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities; other items, net; and certain nonoperating and other excluded items. The Company defines FCF as DCF, less capital expenditures. Management believes that these measures are useful to management and investors as a measure of a company’s ability to internally fund its capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt. These measures eliminate the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be indicative of the Company’s performance from period to period. To assist in measuring the Company’s performance, management will also evaluate Anadarko on a deconsolidated basis, which excludes WES. Years Ended December 31, millions 2018 2017 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (GAAP) $ 5,929 $ 4,009 Add back Increase (decrease) in accounts receivable 211 147 (Increase) decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities (348 ) 32 Other items, net 264 127 Certain nonoperating and other excluded items — 21 Discretionary cash flow from operations (Non-GAAP)* $ 6,056 $ 4,336 Less APC capital expenditures 5,007 4,344 WES capital expenditures 1,178 956 Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) $ (129 ) $ (964 ) *Includes $147 million current tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, related to asset monetizations. 

 Adjusted Discretionary Cash Flow from Operations (Adjusted DCF) and Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted FCF) The Company defines adjusted discretionary cash flow from operations as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities adjusted by changes in accounts receivable; changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities; other items; certain nonoperating and other excluded items; and Western Gas Partners, LP (WES)/Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP) distributions to third parties. The Company defines Adjusted FCF as Adjusted DCF, less APC capital expenditures, which excludes WES. Management believes that these measures are useful to management and investors as a measure of a company’s ability to internally fund its capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt. These measures eliminate the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be indicative of the Company’s performance from period to period. To assist in measuring the Company's performance, management will also evaluate Anadarko on a deconsolidated basis, which excludes WES. Non-GAAP Financial Measures *Includes $181 million of Powder River Basin acquisitions in 2018, of which $176 million was unbudgeted. Years Ended December 31, millions 2018 2017 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (GAAP) $ 5,929 $ 4,009 Adjusted by: Increase (decrease) in accounts receivable 211 147 (Increase) decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities (348) 32 Other items, net 264 127 Certain nonoperating and other excluded items — 21 WES/WGP distributions to third parties (495) (444) Adjusted discretionary cash flow from operations (Non-GAAP)* $ 5,561 $ 3,892 Less APC capital expenditures* (excludes WES) 5,007 4,344 Adjusted free cash flow (Non-GAAP) $ 554 $ (452 )
