Executive Commentary 

"Allergan posted another quarter of strong results to close out 2018, underscoring our focus on execution, financial discipline and the strength of our core business which grew 8.3 percent. Our anchor brands BOTOX® Cosmetic, BOTOX® Therapeutic, VRAYLAR®, JUVÉDERM®, Lo LOESTRIN®, CoolSculpting® and LINZESS® added nearly $1 billion in new revenue to our core business in 2018," said Brent Saunders, Chairman and CEO of Allergan. "I'm also proud of the significant advances we have made in our R&D pipeline with positive clinical results reported from six late-stage development programs. We look to build on that progress in 2019."

"Taken together, these accomplishments and our talented colleagues give me confidence in our ability to continue producing solid results in 2019 and beyond, while also delivering innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, customers and shareholders."

Full-Year 2018 Performance 

GAAP operating loss in 2018 was $6.25 billion compared with $5.92 billion in 2017. Non-GAAP operating income, which excludes the impact of impairments, amortization and other items, was $7.56 billion in 2018 compared to $7.65 billion in 2017, impacted by lower revenues as operating margin remained stable. GAAP cash flow from operations for the full year of 2018 totaled $5.64 billion.

Fourth Quarter 2018 Performance 

GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter 2018 was $5.38 billion, including the impact of impairments. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $1.92 billion, a decrease of 11.8 percent versus the prior year quarter, impacted by lower operating margin and revenues due to the impact of divestitures, products that lost exclusivity and a decline in RESTASIS®. GAAP cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $1.50 billion.

Operating Expenses 

Total GAAP Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense was $1.19 billion for the fourth quarter 2018, a decrease of 5.8 percent from the prior year quarter. Total non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.14 billion for the fourth quarter 2018 compared with $1.13 billion in the prior year period, including an increase in selling and marketing spending in Medical Aesthetics offset by the impact of previous restructurings. GAAP R&D investment for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $678.1 million, compared to $408.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the fourth quarter 2018 was $436.1 million compared to $405.7 million in the prior year quarter, due to increased direct project spend to support pipeline advancement.

Amortization, Tax and Capitalization 

Amortization expense for the fourth quarter 2018 was $1.57 billion, compared to $1.92 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company's GAAP tax rate was 23.2 percent in the fourth quarter 2018. The Company's non-GAAP adjusted tax rate was 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Allergan had cash and marketable securities of $1.91 billion and outstanding indebtedness of $23.8 billion.

Impairments 

In the fourth quarter of 2018, Allergan recorded total pre-tax impairment charges of $5.4 billion. This amount reflects $1.9 billion of other intangible asset impairments, including $1.6 billion for KYBELLA®/BELKYRA® as sales forecasts have declined. The Company's intended sale of Anti-Infectives and its increased cost of capital based on market dynamics as well as other commercial factors prompted a review of its General Medicine Reporting Unit goodwill. As a result, the Company wrote off $3.5 billion of total goodwill, including $622 million allocated to Anti-Infectives.

Allergan reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and achieving a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5X by the end of 2020.

These actions reflect the Company's conviction in its strategy and strong future cash flow position, allowing for periodic return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks while maintaining investment grade ratings and continuing its strategy to pay down debt.
