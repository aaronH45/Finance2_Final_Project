Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

Appointment of Chief Operating Officer 

Deere & Company today announced that its board of directors elected John C. May, 49, President and Chief Operating Officer effective April 1, 2019. From 2012 to 2018, Mr. May has served as President, Worldwide Agriculture & Turf Division – Agricultural Solutions and Chief Information Officer. In 2018 he was named President, Worldwide Agriculture & Turf Division Global Harvesting and Turf Platforms, Ag Solutions, Americas and Australia. 

In connection with the new assignment, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) approved an increase in Mr. May’s annual base salary effective April 1, 2019 from $744,060 to $1,000,764. 

Mr. May continues to participate in the Company’s short-term incentive and long-term incentive cash plans that payout based on the Company’s operating return on operating assets and shareholder value added during the performance periods. Considering the new base salary, the target award under the short-term incentive plan for Mr. May for the fiscal 2019 performance period will increase to $1,100,841 from $744,060. Mr. May’s target award under the long-term incentive cash plan for the performance period ending in fiscal 2019, which is based on his salary grade in September 2019, remains unchanged at $606,234. 

Appointment of Chief Financial Officer 

The board of directors also elected Ryan D. Campbell, 44, Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, effective April 1, 2019. Mr. Campbell replaces Rajesh Kalathur, who has been elected to the position of President, John Deere Financial & Chief Information Officer. 

Mr. Campbell was elected Vice President and Deputy Financial Officer last year. Mr. Campbell previously has served as Vice President and Comptroller, and as Finance Director for the Company’s Agriculture and Turf Division. Mr. Campbell joined the Company in 2007 and has held various finance and accounting positions in the Company. 

In connection with his appointment, Mr. Campbell will receive an annualized base salary of $567,768. Mr. Campbell will continue to participate in the Company’s short-term incentive and long-term incentive cash plans that payout based on the Company’s operating return on operating assets and shareholder value added during the performance periods. The target award under the short-term incentive plan for Mr. Campbell for the fiscal 2019 performance period will be $567,768. Mr. Campbell’s target award under the long-term incentive cash plan for the performance period ending in fiscal 2019 will be $242,559. 

Awards for Mr. May and Mr. Campbell under the incentive cash plans are based in part on base salaries during the performance period. Actual bonuses likely will differ due to actual Company performance during the performance periods, any additional changes in salary, the number of participants sharing in the long-term incentive cash bonus pool, and any plan and award changes approved by the Committee. Descriptions of the Company’s incentive cash plans and other benefits available to named executive officers are contained in the Company’s proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 11, 2019 and are incorporated herein by reference. 

There are no family relationships or related persons transactions between Mr. May or Mr. Campbell and the Company or any director, executive officer or person nominated or chosen by the Company to become a director or executive officer. 

These changes and related senior management changes for the Company are described in the text of a press release issued by the Company on March 1, 2019, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
