[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Full Year Financial Results

U.S. Networks’ revenues for the full year of 2018 increased 85% to $6.4 billion on a reported basis compared with the prior year. Excluding the impact of the Transactions, revenues increased 1%, as a 3% increase in advertising revenues and a 1% increase in distribution revenues were partially offset by a 27% decrease in Other revenues due to lower program and merchandising sales. On a pro forma combined basis, U.S. Networks' revenues for the full year increased 2%. Pro forma advertising revenues increased 3% primarily driven by the continued monetization of our digital content offerings and an increase in pricing, partially offset by the impact of audience declines on our linear networks. Pro forma distribution revenues increased 1%, reflecting increases in contractual affiliate rates, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and to a lesser extent, the timing of lower contributions from content deliveries under licensing agreements.

NM: Not Meaningful

(1)Pro forma is defined as the results of the Company as if the Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2017. Pro forma change for Total Company and the International Networks segment excludes the impact from foreign currency fluctuations.

FULL YEAR 2019 OUTLOOK(1) 

Discovery will provide forward-looking guidance in connection with this quarterly earnings announcement on its quarterly earnings conference call and webcast referenced hereafter.

(1)Discovery is unable to provide a reconciliation of the forward-looking guidance to GAAP measures as, at this time, Discovery cannot determine all of the adjustments that would be required.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

In addition to the results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) provided in this release, the Company has presented Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, earnings per diluted share and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Please review the supplemental financial schedules beginning on page 21 for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.

Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Excluding the Impact of Currency Effects

The Company evaluates the operating performance of its segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and other charges, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, (vi) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios, and (vii) third-party transaction costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of Scripps Networks. 

The Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted OIBDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes mark-to-market share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions and Scripps Networks transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. The Company also excludes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. Total Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the comments that follow for our methodology for calculating growth rates excluding the impact of currency effects.

Effective January 1, 2019, our definition of Adjusted OIBDA was modified to exclude all share-based compensation, whereas only mark-to-market share-based compensation is excluded for each of the periods presented herein. See pages 23-24 for Adjusted OIBDA as historically reported and under the revised definition.

Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Excluding the Impact of Currency Effects

Adjusted EPS is defined as earnings excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets per diluted share. The Company believes Adjusted EPS is relevant to investors because this metric allows them to evaluate the performance of the Company's operations exclusive of the non-cash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets that impact the comparability of results from period to period. Refer to the comments that follow for our methodology for calculating growth rates excluding the impact of currency effects.

Methodology for Calculating Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Currency Effects

The impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our results. For example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis (ex-FX), in addition to results reported in accordance with GAAP, provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-FX excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. The presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.

7

The ex-FX change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. The ex-FX change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process (the “2018 Baseline Rate”), and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2018 Baseline Rate. In addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-FX results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling, general and administrative expense, as presented, currently excludes mark-to-market share-based compensation and Scripps Networks transaction and integration costs due to their impact on comparability between periods.

Free Cash Flow

The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less acquisitions of property and equipment. The Company uses free cash flow as it believes it is an important indicator for management and investors of the Company’s liquidity, including its ability to reduce debt, make strategic investments and return capital to stockholders.

Pro Forma Adjustments

The discussion and tables beginning on page 13 compare our actual and pro forma combined results as if the Transactions occurred on January 1, 2017. Management believes reviewing our actual operating results in addition to combined pro forma results is useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of our businesses. Our combined U.S. Networks, International Networks and Corporate and Inter-Segment Eliminations pro forma information is based on the historical operating results of the respective businesses as applicable to each segment and includes adjustments directly attributable to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2017, such as:

1. The impact of the purchase price allocation to the fair value of assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests, such as intangible amortization;

2. Adjustments to remove items associated with the Transactions that will not have a continuing impact on the combined entity, such as transaction costs and the impact of employee retention agreements; and

3. Changes to align accounting policies.

Adjustments do not include costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the acquired businesses since January 1, 2017 and should not be taken as indicative of the Company's future consolidated results of operations.

Actual amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 include the results of operations for the Discovery and Scripps Networks, OWN and MTG businesses for the period since each respective transaction. Scripps Networks was acquired on March 6, 2018, OWN was consolidated on November 30, 2017 and MTG was consolidated on September 25, 2017.
