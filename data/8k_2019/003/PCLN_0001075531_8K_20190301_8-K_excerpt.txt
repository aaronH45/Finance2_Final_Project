Item 5.02.Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

Booking Holdings Inc. (the "Company") adopted a new form of performance share unit agreement (the "Form PSU Agreement") under the Company's 1999 Omnibus Plan (the "Plan") with respect to 2019 performance share unit awards to its named executive officers. The Form PSU Agreement provides for the grant of performance share units to executive officers, which generally vest at the end of three years of service but only result in the issuance of shares if the Company achieves a specified threshold of Cumulative Consolidated Compensation EBITDA (as defined in the Form PSU Agreement). The exact number of shares issuable pursuant to the Form PSU Agreement depends on the Company's performance against Cumulative Consolidated Compensation EBITDA targets set by the Compensation Committee for the performance period, and in general can range from 0 shares to 2x the nominal number of shares subject to the performance share units. 

The foregoing description of the Form PSU Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.
