CBRE GROUP, INC. REPORTS DOUBLE-DIGIT REVENUE AND 

EARNINGS GROWTH FOR FULL-YEAR AND FOURTH-QUARTER 2018 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Los Angeles, CA – February 13, 2019 — CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE) today reported strong financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018. Revenue and earnings for the year reached record highs for the company. 

“Our business ended the year with broad strength across geographies and business lines,” said Bob Sulentic, president and chief executive officer of CBRE. “Our results for both the quarter and the year reflect the operational gains and capital investments we have made to enable our people to produce hard-to-replicate client outcomes.” 

“Our new corporate structure, which took effect on January 1st, puts some of our sector’s very best leaders in compelling new leadership roles, sharpens our focus on excellence across our services and enables operating efficiencies across our business. These moves are already having an impact and we expect them to come through in our financial performance in 2019.” 

“We start the new year with excellent momentum across our global business. The global economy is expected to grow at a healthy, but moderately slower pace than in recent years. Cross-border capital flows are solid, notwithstanding the ongoing trade and geopolitical tensions. While we remain mindful of potential macro challenges and the length of the current economic expansion, this continues to be a supportive environment for our business.”

Fourth-Quarter 2018 Segment and Business Line Review 

The following tables present highlights of CBRE segment performance during the fourth quarter of 2018 (dollars in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Revenue growth in the regional services businesses remained strong across all three regions. In EMEA (Europe, the Middle East & Africa), revenue rose 18% (23% local currency), with notable growth in Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Americas revenue increased 14% (15% local currency), paced by a 15% gain in the United States. APAC (Asia Pacific) revenue climbed 9% (14% local currency), led by Greater China, India and Japan. 

Global revenue growth was paced by leasing, which had a 22% (24% local currency) gain, as all three regions produced double-digit increases. The Americas led the way with a 26% (27% local currency) increase (about 22% organic growth), driven by robust growth (29%) in the U.S., particularly with account-based clients. APAC leasing rose 18% (22% local currency), with double-digit growth in most major economies across the region. EMEA also had strong growth across most of the region, with leasing revenue rising 10% (15% local currency), led by Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. 

CBRE continued to capture a significant share of the growing trend toward outsourcing real estate and facilities services. On a global basis, occupier outsourcing revenue increased 14% (17% local currency) and fee revenue surged 17% (20% local currency). All three regions produced double-digit growth in occupier outsourcing revenue and fee revenue. 

Combined revenue from the capital markets businesses – property sales and commercial mortgage origination – rose 9% (11% local currency). 

Global property sales revenue increased 7% (10% local currency), as all three regions logged market share gains. A key catalyst was the Americas, which saw a 12% (13% local currency) sales revenue gain, paced by 15% growth in the United States. APAC was also notably strong as China, Japan and Korea drove a 6% (10% local currency) sales revenue increase. EMEA slipped 2% (but was up 3% in local currency). This region faced a difficult comparison as fourth quarter 2017 sales revenue was up 20% in local currency compared to fourth quarter 2016. Commercial mortgage origination activity remained strong with revenue up 16% (same local currency). 

Recurring revenue from loan servicing activities continued to grow robustly, rising 20% (same local currency). The loan servicing portfolio grew to $201 billion at the end of the fourth quarter – up 15% from year-end 2017. 

Valuation revenue rose 5% (8% local currency), driven by EMEA and the Americas. Property management services produced increases of 6% (8% local currency) in revenue and 1% (3% local currency) in fee revenue. 

Combined adjusted EBITDA for CBRE’s real estate investment businesses (Global Investment Management and Development Services) rose 2% (3% local currency). This growth was led by Global Investment Management, which generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 4% (7% local currency), reflecting higher carried interest revenue from asset sales as well as increased asset management and incentive fees. 

•  

The in-process Development Services portfolio increased to a record $9.0 billion, up $0.2 billion from third-quarter 2018, reflecting the continued conversion of pipeline activity. The pipeline increased by $0.1 billion during the fourth quarter to $3.7 billion.

The terms “fee revenue,” “organic fee revenue,” “adjusted net income,” “adjusted earnings per share” (or adjusted EPS), “EBITDA” and “adjusted EBITDA,” all of which CBRE uses in this press release, are non-GAAP financial measures under SEC guidelines, and you should refer to the footnotes below as well as the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section in this press release for a further explanation of these measures. We have also included in that section reconciliations of these measures in specific periods to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for those periods. 

1 We adopted new revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2018. Certain restatements have been made to the 2017 financial statements to conform with the 2018 presentation. 

2 Local currency percentage change is calculated by comparing current-period results at prior-period exchange rates versus prior-period results. 

3 Fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. Organic fee revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 further excludes contributions from all acquisitions completed after fourth-quarter 2017. Organic fee revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 further excludes contributions from: (i) all acquisitions completed after first-quarter 2017 for the three months ended March 31, 2018; (ii) all acquisitions completed after second-quarter 2017 for the three months ended June 30, 2018; (iii) all acquisitions completed after third-quarter 2017 for the three months ended September 30, 2018; and (iv) all acquisitions completed after fourth-quarter 2017 for the three months ended December 31, 2018. 

4 Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share (or adjusted EPS) exclude the effect of select items from GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per diluted share as well as adjust the provision for income taxes for such charges. Adjustments during the periods presented included the removal of a one-time non-cash gain associated with remeasuring CBRE’s investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary in New England to fair value as of the date it acquired the remaining controlling interest, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets attributable to acquisitions, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, costs associated with our reorganization, including cost-savings initiatives, costs incurred in connection with a litigation settlement, integration and other costs related to acquisitions and certain carried interest incentive compensation (reversal) expense to align with the timing of associated revenue. Adjustments for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 also included an update to the provisional estimated tax impact of U.S. tax reform initially recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

CBRE Press Release 

February 13, 2019

5 Our provision for income taxes for 2017 included a net charge of $143.4 million attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), including a provisional amount representing our estimate of the U.S. federal and state tax impact of the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), “Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act)”, which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. During 2018, we continued to analyze the impact of the Tax Act and interpreted the additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies. The net charge in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 related to an update of the net provision associated with the Tax Act based upon our finalization of analysis of the impact of the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed our analysis and the final net charge associated with the Tax Act was $156.7 million. 

6 EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Amounts shown for adjusted EBITDA further remove (from EBITDA) the impact of a one-time non-cash gain associated with remeasuring CBRE’s investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary in New England to fair value as of the date it acquired the remaining controlling interest, costs associated with our reorganization, including cost-savings initiatives, costs incurred in connection with a litigation settlement, integration and other costs related to acquisitions, and certain carried interest incentive compensation (reversal) expense to align with the timing of associated revenue. 

7 Revenue in the Development Services segment does not include equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate, net of non-controlling interests. EBITDA includes equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate, net of non-controlling interests, and the associated compensation expense.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The following measures are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC guidelines: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

These measures are not recognized measurements under United States generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP.” When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use them in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 

Our management generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. The company believes that these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. The company further uses certain of these measures, and believes that they are useful to investors, for purposes described below. 

With respect to fee revenue and organic fee revenue: the company believes that investors may find these measures useful to analyze the financial performance of our Occupier Outsourcing and Property Management business lines and our business generally. Fee revenue excludes costs reimbursable by clients, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business. Organic fee revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2018 further excludes contributions from all acquisitions completed after fourth-quarter 2017. Organic fee revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 further excludes contributions from: (i) all acquisitions completed after first-quarter 2017 for the three months ended March 31, 2018; (ii) all acquisitions completed after second-quarter 2017 for the three months ended June 30, 2018; (iii) all acquisitions completed after third-quarter 2017 for the three months ended September 30, 2018; and (iv) all acquisitions completed after fourth-quarter 2017 for the three months ended December 31, 2018. 

With respect to adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA: the company believes that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the accounting effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions—and in the case of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA—the effects of financings and income tax and the accounting effects of capital spending. All of these measures may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In the case of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, these measures are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use because they do not consider cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA measures calculated herein may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. The company also uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS as significant components when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.
