Item 8.01 Other Events

On January 30, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 billion and no set term limits, replacing the July 2010 authorization. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company's shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
