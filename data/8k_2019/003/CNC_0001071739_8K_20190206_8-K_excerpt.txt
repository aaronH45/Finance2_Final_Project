ITEM 5.03 AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR

On January 28, 2019, Centene Corporation (“Centene”) held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”), at Centene’s headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri. At the Special Meeting, the stockholders approved an amendment (the “Amendment”) to Centene’s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of authorized shares of Centene common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), from 400,000,000 shares of Common Stock to 800,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The full text of the Amendment is attached as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

In December 2018, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of Centene’s Common Stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend to be distributed on February 6, 2019 to stockholders of record as of December 24, 2018 (the “Stock Split”). 

The Amendment became effective upon Centene’s filing of the Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of Centene with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 6, 2019. Centene’s shares of common stock will begin trading at the split-adjusted price on February 7, 2019.

The Stock Split is described in greater detail in Centene’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 26, 2018.

ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS

On February 7, 2019, Centene issued a press release announcing the filing of the Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 6, 2019 and the effectiveness of the Stock Split.
