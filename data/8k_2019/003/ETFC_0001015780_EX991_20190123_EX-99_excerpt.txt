 "This was a year of records for E*TRADE. We generated our highest net revenue, operating margin, and earnings, while capitalizing on an unprecedented operating environment to produce record organic business growth. We drove our strongest growth in net new brokerage accounts and assets, while we grew our stock plan channel at our best rate ever. We gained a foothold in advisor solutions, and significantly expanded the scale of our brokerage through opportunistic acquisitions. We accomplished all of this while returning more than $1 billion to our shareholders via share repurchases and our first ever quarterly dividend,” said Karl Roessner, Chief Executive Officer. “Our team did not yield in their drive to further enhance our world-class platforms, while delivering rock-solid service amid a period of pronounced market volatility. During 2019, we will continue to surprise and delight our trading customers, grow our institutional channels, and expand our wealth management offering—all while generating value for our shareholders."  

 The Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share on the Company's outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend is payable on February 15, 2019, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 1, 2019.

 Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures  

 Management believes that adjusting GAAP measures by excluding or including certain items is helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze the Company’s current performance, prospects, and valuation. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate operating performance and in formulating the budget for future periods. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below are appropriate for evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company.  

 Adjusted Operating Margin  

 Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted income before income taxes by net revenue. Adjusted income before income taxes excludes the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt. Management believes that excluding the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt from operating margin provides a useful measure of the Company's ongoing operating performance because management excludes them when evaluating operating margin performance. See endnote (2) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.  

 Adjusted Return on Common Equity  

 Adjusted return on common equity is calculated by dividing annualized adjusted net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders' equity. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders excludes the after-tax impact of provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt. Management believes that excluding the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt from net income available to common shareholders provides a useful measure of the Company's ongoing operating performance because management excludes them when evaluating return on common equity performance. See endnote (3) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.  

 Tangible Common Equity Book Value per Share  

 Tangible common equity book value per share represents common shareholders’ equity, which excludes preferred stock, less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of related deferred tax liabilities) divided by common stock outstanding. The Company believes that tangible common equity book value per share is a measure of the Company’s capital strength. See endnote (8) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.  

 Corporate Cash  

 Corporate cash represents cash held at the parent company as well as cash held in certain subsidiaries, not including bank and brokerage subsidiaries, that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval or notification. The Company believes that corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent company’s liquidity as it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in regulated subsidiaries. See endnote (9) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.  

 It is important to note that these non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or superior to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. For additional information on the adjustments to these non-GAAP measures, please see the Company’s financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” that will be included in the periodic report the Company expects to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein.

 (6) Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company updated the presentation of its consolidated financial statements as follows:   

 On the consolidated statement of income, fair value hedging adjustments, previously referred to as hedge ineffectiveness, are included within net interest income beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Amounts prior to 2018 have not been reclassified to conform to current period presentation and continue to be reflected within gains on securities and other, net. Fair value hedging adjustments were as follows for the respective periods:  

 Expenses of $6 million, $5 million, and $9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively  

 Expenses of $19 million and $14 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively

 (7) Amounts and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. For percentage based metrics, the variance represents the current period less the prior period.

The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP common equity book value and common equity book value per share to non-GAAP tangible common equity book value and tangible common equity book value per share at period end (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
