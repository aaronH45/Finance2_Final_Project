Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition 

On January 23, 2019, Comcast Corporation furnished a Form 8-K to report the results of its operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, including diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders (“EPS”) and EPS on an adjusted basis (“Adjusted EPS”). Comcast believes that investors, in evaluating our ongoing core operations and making period-over-period comparisons to our and our peers’ performance, would benefit from increased transparency on the magnitude of amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, as disclosed in Comcast’s Form 10-K filed on January 31, 2019. Going forward, as disclosed below, Comcast will present Adjusted EPS to also exclude amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets. 

Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets was $1.1 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, EPS was $2.53, and excluding $1.1 billion of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets ($836 million net of tax) and other adjustments, Adjusted EPS was $2.73. Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and sets forth the reasons Comcast believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures contained herein and therein provides useful information to investors regarding Comcast’s results of operations and financial condition. 

Comcast does not intend for this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 to be treated as “filed” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or incorporated by reference into its filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
