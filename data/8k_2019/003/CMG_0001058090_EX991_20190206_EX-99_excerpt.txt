 ﻿  

 “I'm very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results with 6.1% comparable restaurant sales growth that included 2% transaction growth.

Fourth quarter 2018 results:  

 Revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, an increase of 10.4% from the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in revenue was driven by a 6.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings. Comparable restaurant sales improved primarily as a result of an increase in average check which includes a 3.3% benefit from menu price increases. Comparable restaurant sales also improved due to a 2% increase in comparable restaurant transactions.  

 We opened 40 new restaurants during the quarter and closed or relocated 12, bringing the total restaurant count to 2,491.  

 Food, beverage and packaging costs were 33.2% of revenue, a decrease of 100 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the benefit of menu price increases taken in late 2017 and early 2018 and to a lesser extent favorable avocado pricing, partially offset by increased freight expenses and higher paper and packaging costs.  

 Restaurant level operating margin was 17.0% in the quarter, an improvement from 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement was driven primarily by leverage from the comparable restaurant sales increase. This was partially offset by increased marketing and promotional costs and wage inflation at the crew level.   

 General and administrative expenses were 8.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 330 basis points, over the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $15.1 million related to the corporate restructuring and other unusual charges, $10.8 million related to higher costs associated with our annual incentive cash bonus program (AIP), and $9.2 million in higher stock compensation due to a reversal of expense taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 for performance-based stock awards.  

 Impairment, closure costs, and asset disposals increased $6.7 million in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter 2017 primarily due to the planned closures of underperforming restaurants, offices affected by corporate restructuring, and the write down of the associated long-lived asset values.  

 The effective tax rate was 26.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to 28.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, and federal tax credits offset by unfavorable tax impacts of expirations and cancellations of various equity awards.  

 Net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $32.0 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to net income of $43.8 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of restaurant closure costs, corporate restructuring, and certain other costs, adjusted net income was $48.1 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.72.   

 Our Board of Directors has also approved the investment of up to an additional $100 million, exclusive of commissions, to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. This repurchase authorization, in addition to up to approximately $57.6 million available as of December 31, 2018, for repurchases under a previously announced repurchase authorization, may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.  

 Full year 2018 results:  

 Revenue for 2018 was $4.9 billion, an increase of 8.7% from 2017. The increase in revenue was driven by new restaurant openings and a 4.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales improved primarily as a result of an increase in average check, including a 4.0% benefit from menu price increases in late 2017 and early 2018, partially offset by 0.8% fewer comparable restaurant transactions.   

 We opened 137 new restaurants during the year and closed or relocated 54, in-line with previous guidance, bringing the total restaurant count to 2,491.  

 Food, beverage and packaging costs were 32.9% of revenue, a decrease of 140 basis points compared to 2017. The decrease was driven by the benefit of the menu price increases and relief in avocado prices. These decreases were partially offset by increased freight costs, and to a lesser extent increased costs associated with tortillas and rice.  

 Restaurant level operating margin was 18.7% for 2018, an improvement from 16.9% in 2017. The improvement was driven primarily by leverage from the comparable restaurant sales increase, combined with lower marketing and promotional expenses, partially offset by wage inflation at the crew level.   

General and administrative expenses were 7.7% of revenue for 2018, an increase of 110 basis points, over 2017. The increase was due to $32.1 million related to the corporate restructuring and other unusual charges, $21.4 million related to higher costs associated with our annual incentive cash bonus program (AIP) and retention bonuses, $10.9 million associated with the biennial All Managers’ Conference that was held in September 2018, and the remaining increase primarily relates to general and administrative growth to support our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience. These increases were partially offset by the benefit of comparing against the non-recurring charge of $30.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2017 related to a data security incident in the second quarter of 2017.  

 Impairment, closure costs, and asset disposals increased $53.3 million compared to 2017 primarily due to the planned closures of underperforming restaurants that began in the second quarter of 2018, as well as the closure of offices affected by corporate restructuring, and the write down of a large portion of the associated long-lived asset values.  

 The effective tax rate was 34.2% in 2018, compared to 36.1% in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the favorable impacts of the TCJA and federal tax credits offset by unfavorable tax impacts of expirations and cancellations of various equity awards.  

 Net income for 2018 was $176.6 million, or $6.31 per diluted share, compared to net income of $176.3 million, or $6.17 per diluted share, for 2017. Excluding the impact of restaurant asset impairment, corporate restructuring, and certain other costs, adjusted net income was $253.4 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.06.  

 Full Year 2019 Outlook  

 For 2019, management is anticipating the following:  

   ·    Mid-single digit range comparable restaurant sales growth 

   ·    140 to 155 new restaurant openings 

   ·    An estimated effective full year tax rate between 27.0% and 30.0%

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

  (in thousands, except per share amounts)  

 (unaudited)  

 ﻿  

 The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented in the text above to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.   

 Adjusted net income is net income excluding restaurant asset impairment, corporate restructuring, and certain other costs. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. We believe that these measures enhance investors’ ability to compare the past financial performance of our underlying business with our current business performance and reflect the performance of our underlying restaurants separate from asset impairment, corporate restructuring and certain other costs at the corporate level. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for similar purposes. Our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share measures may not be comparable to other companies’ adjusted income measures.
