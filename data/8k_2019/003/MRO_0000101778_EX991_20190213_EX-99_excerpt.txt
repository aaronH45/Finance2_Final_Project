Full-year 2018 Results

Marathon Oil reported full-year 2018 net income of $1,096 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, which includes the impact of certain items not typically represented in analysts' earnings estimates and that would otherwise affect 

comparability of results. Adjusted net income was $601 million, or $0.71 per diluted share. Net operating cash flow was $3,234 million, or $3,211 million before changes in working capital.

Full-year 2018 Highlights

•Delivered on commitment to capital discipline with no change to initial $2.3 billion development capital budget

•Realized 78% annual improvement in CROIC and 65% annual improvement in CFPDAS

•Generated more than $865 million of organic free cash flow, post-dividend[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Maintained focus on resource base enhancement and full-cycle returns by advancing successful core extension tests in Eagle Ford and Bakken and progressing REx program; acquired approx. 260,000 net acres at less than $850 per acre in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play

•Continued portfolio management with successful sale of Libya and receipt of final payment for the sale of oil sands mining business; disposition proceeds more than fully funded REx and all other resource capture activities, including successful participation in the New Mexico Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lease sale

•Drillbit F&D costs of less than $12.50/boe at 125% reserve replacement

•Further strengthened balance sheet and financial flexibility by increasing cash and cash equivalents by $900 million to $1.5 billion at year-end 

“2018 was a year of differentiated execution for Marathon Oil,” said Chairman, President and CEO Lee Tillman. “While many in our industry talked about capital discipline, we delivered. In 2018, we budgeted conservatively and never wavered, getting more for every dollar of capital we invested. We drove significant improvement to our corporate returns and cash flow per debt adjusted share. Through improving capital efficiency we delivered more oil growth, generated $865 million of organic free cash flow post-dividend, and returned most of that cash back to our shareholders via share repurchases. As we turn to 2019 and beyond, we remain committed to this same framework for success. With the foundation of a peer leading balance sheet and the competitive advantages of our multi-basin portfolio, our 2019 capital program will drive improving corporate returns and generate organic free cash flow above $45 WTI, as we continue to prioritize return of cash to our shareholders.”

Fourth quarter U.S. unit production costs were $5.31 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe), a sequential reduction of 14 percent.

EAGLE FORD: Marathon Oil's Eagle Ford production averaged 107,000 net boed in the fourth quarter, up 2 percent from the year-ago quarter. The Company brought 38 gross Company-operated wells to sales in the quarter with an average 30-day initial production (IP) rate of 1,810 boed (72% oil).

OKLAHOMA: Marathon Oil's Oklahoma production averaged 67,000 net boed during fourth quarter 2018, up 4 percent from the year-ago quarter, with only 12 gross Company-operated wells brought to sales. In the SCOOP Woodford, seven infill wells on the 3R pad (eight wells per section spacing) achieved an average 30-day IP rate of 2,600 boed (69% liquids). On the same pad, Marathon Oil also brought online a Springer delineation well that achieved a 30-day IP rate of 1,825 boed (81% oil).

NORTHERN DELAWARE: Marathon Oil's Northern Delaware production increased to an average of 26,000 net boed in fourth quarter 2018, up 138 percent from the year-ago quarter. The Company brought 12 gross Company-operated wells to sales in the Malaga and Red Hills areas with an average 30-day IP rate of 1,935 boed (49% oil), 

or 360 boed per 1,000 foot lateral. Fourth quarter activity was primarily focused on delineating the Company’s acreage position, including Lower Wolfcamp spacing tests in Malaga. During the fourth quarter, the Company executed a comprehensive water management agreement covering the entire Red Hills prospect area, complementing a previously announced agreement in Eddy County.

RESOURCE CAPTURE: Outside of the development capital program, fourth quarter REx capital spending totaled $75 million, consistent with guidance, and bringing full-year 2018 REx spending to $369 million. In addition to REx, full-year 2018 resource capture also included the previously announced $105 million bolt-on acquisition in New Mexico through the BLM lease sale. Total 2018 resource capture spend of $474 million was more than fully funded through divestiture proceeds received in first quarter 2018.

International

International production averaged 105,000 net boed for fourth quarter 2018, down 13 percent compared to the year-ago quarter on a divestiture-adjusted basis. The decrease reflects unscheduled downtime at the non-operated Foinaven complex as well as natural decline and planned maintenance activities in E.G. Fourth quarter 2018 International unit production costs averaged $5.40 per boe.

Production Guidance

For full year 2019, the Company forecasts total oil production growth of 10 percent, with U.S. oil growth of 12 percent, both at the midpoint of guidance and on a divestiture adjusted basis. Oil growth is expected to outpace boe production growth, consistent with a focus on corporate returns. For first quarter 2019, the Company forecasts total oil production of 195 - 215 bopd, with U.S. oil production of 175 - 185 bopd. The first quarter 2019 U.S. production guidance range accounts for extreme weather conditions experienced early in the quarter. The first quarter 2019 International production guidance range reflects a planned triennial shutdown in E.G. to conduct turnaround activity, consistent with prior disclosure. For more specific detail regarding 2019 production guidance, please refer to the guidance tables included within this release.

Corporate

The Company has executed $700 million of share repurchases, returning additional capital to shareholders beyond the $169 million annual dividend. Share repurchases were more than fully funded by organic free cash flow of over $865 million post-dividend.

Total liquidity as of Dec. 31 was approximately $4.9 billion, which consisted of $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility of $3.4 billion which was extended by one year to 2022.

The adjustments to net income for fourth quarter 2018 totaled $256 million before tax, primarily due to the income impact associated with unrealized gains on derivative instruments, partially offset by a write off related to historical International exploration expenses and associated well costs.

For 2019, the Company's open crude hedge positions (as of Feb 12) include an average of 60,000 bopd at a weighted average floor price of $56.67 and a weighted average ceiling price of $73.18, hedged through three-way collars. 

Reserves 

During 2018, Marathon Oil added proved reserves of 186 million boe for a reserve replacement ratio of 125 percent excluding dispositions, at a drillbit finding and development (F&D) cost of $12.41. Virtually all of the additions were in the U.S. Net proved reserves were approximately 1.28 billion boe at year-end 2018, down from year-end 2017 primarily due to the disposition of Libya.

On Thursday, Feb. 14, at 9:00 a.m. ET, the Company will conduct a question and answer webcast/call, which will include forward-looking information.

Definitions

CROIC - Cash return on invested capital; calculated by taking cash flow (operating cash flow before working capital + net interest after tax) divided by (average stockholder's equity + average net debt).

Free cash flow - Operating cash flow, less capital expenditure, less dividends, plus other.

Organic free cash flow - Operating cash flow before working capital (excluding exploration costs other than well costs), less development capital expenditures, less dividends, plus other.

Non-GAAP Measures

In analyzing and planning for its business, Marathon Oil supplements its use of GAAP financial measures with non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share, net cash provided by continuing operations before changes in working capital, and organic free cash flow because the Company believes this information is useful to investors to help evaluate the Company's financial performance between periods and to compare the Company's performance to certain competitors. Management also uses net cash provided by continuing operations before changes in working capital to demonstrate the Company's ability to internally fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and service debt. The Company considers adjusted net income (loss), adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted net income (loss) per share and adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations per share as another way to meaningfully represent the Company's operational performance for the period presented; consequently, it excludes the impact of mark-to-market accounting, impairment charges, dispositions, pension settlements, and other items that could be considered “non-operating” or “non-core” in nature. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the business that, when viewed with GAAP results may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the business and are a useful tool to help management and investors make informed decisions about Marathon Oil's financial and operating performance. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our investor package on our website at www.marathonoil.com and in the tables below. Marathon Oil strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.
