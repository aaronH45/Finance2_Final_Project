WEST PALM BEACH, FL, February 4, 2019 - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE: AMG) today reported its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018. AMG’s GAAP results include a non-cash expense of $240 million, reflecting the reduction of carrying value in an investment the Company made in a non-U.S. alternative manager in 2015.

For the fourth quarter of 2018, diluted earnings per share were $(2.88), compared to $5.50 for the same period of 2017, and Economic earnings per share (“Economic EPS”) were $3.53, compared to $4.68 for the same period of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2018, Net income (controlling interest) was $(151.3) million, compared to $315.4 million for the same period of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2018, Economic net income was $185.8 million, compared to $261.3 million for the same period of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $191.3 million, compared to $361.3 million for the same period of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2018, Consolidated revenue was $564.4 million, compared to $604.1 million for the same period of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2018, Aggregate fees (an operating measure comprising the total asset- and performance-based fees of all Affiliates) were $1.2 billion, compared to $1.7 billion for the same period of 2017. (Economic EPS, Economic net income, and Adjusted EBITDA are defined in the attached tables, along with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.) 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, Net income (controlling interest) was $243.6 million, compared to $689.5 million for the same period of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Economic net income was $780.7 million, compared to $824.4 million for the same period of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $961.8 million, compared to $1,116.2 million for the same period of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Consolidated revenue was $2.4 billion, compared to $2.3 billion for the same period of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Aggregate fees were $5.4 billion, compared to $5.5 billion for the same period of 2017. 

Net client cash flows for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $(15.8) billion. AMG’s aggregate assets under management were $736 billion at December 31, 2018.

The Company also announced a first-quarter cash dividend of $0.32 per common share, representing an increase of approximately 7% over the prior level, payable March 1, 2019 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 14, 2019. In addition, AMG’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s share repurchase authorization to a total of five million shares.

“Against the backdrop of significant declines across most asset classes for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2018, AMG generated Economic earnings per share of $3.53 for the quarter, and $14.50 for the year. Earnings results for the fourth quarter reflected lower performance fees, negative markets, and one-time items,” stated Nathaniel Dalton, Chief Executive Officer of AMG. “While industry-wide risk aversion as well as anticipated seasonal redemptions affected our net client cash flows for the quarter, we see meaningfully improving flow results already in 2019. Heightened market volatility continues to provide favorable conditions for the best active managers to distinguish themselves, and with a diverse array of independently managed, distinctive return streams, our Affiliates are well-positioned to benefit.”

Mr. Dalton concluded, “We continue to actively position our business to execute on AMG’s unique opportunity set. With our financial flexibility and our 25-year track record as the partner of choice to leading independent firms, we are able to focus on the highest growth opportunities within our existing Affiliates while also investing in excellent new Affiliates and remaining committed to disciplined capital allocation. We are confident in our ability to generate strong earnings growth and create long-term shareholder value.”

Notes

(in millions)

(A)Assets under management is presented on a current basis without regard to the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s results in our operating performance measures and Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our operating performance measures and financial results as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s results in our operating performance measures and Consolidated Financial Statements. For certain of our equity method Affiliates, we report aggregate fees and the Affiliate's financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements one quarter in arrears.

(B)Aggregate fees consists of the total asset- and performance-based fees earned by all of our Affiliates. Aggregate fees is an operating measure used by management to evaluate the operating performance and material trends across our entire business. Aggregate fees is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, our GAAP performance measures.

(C)Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments, and adjustments to our contingent payment arrangements. We believe that many investors use this measure when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or other GAAP performance measures.

(D)Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method investments in Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, we excluded from Economic net income (controlling interest) a one-time benefit from changes in U.S. tax law, as more fully described in Note I. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to the acquisition of interests in Affiliates, and it is therefore employed as our principal performance measure. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or other GAAP performance measures.

We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in the value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders. We excluded the one-time impact of the changes in U.S. tax law to ensure comparability with prior and future periods.

(E)Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of the convertible securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Earnings per share (diluted) or other GAAP performance measures.

(F)Other primarily includes the assets under management attributable to Affiliate product transitions and transfers of our interests in Affiliates.

(G)For the three months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded a $33.3 non-cash expense to reduce the carrying value of one of our U.S. alternative managers accounted for under the equity method. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $240.0 non-cash expense to reduce the carrying value of one of our non-U.S. alternative managers accounted for under the equity method.

(H)For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, Other economic items are net of income tax expense of $4.4 and $5.8, respectively. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, the income tax effects of Other economic items were not significant.

(I)Our consolidated income tax provision includes taxes attributable to the controlling interest, and to a lesser extent, taxes attributable to non-controlling interests. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, tax attributable to the controlling interest includes a one-time net benefit of $194.1 from the changes in U.S. tax law enacted on December 22, 2017, primarily from the re-measurement of our deferred tax liabilities associated with our intangible assets and convertible securities. 

The following table summarizes our consolidated tax provision:

(J)Other items include depreciation and adjustments to contingent payment arrangements.

(K)As of December 31, 2017 and 2018, Redeemable non-controlling interests includes Affiliate sponsored consolidated products predominantly attributable to third party investors of $39.4 and $91.0, respectively.
