(a)Segment revenues include sales of products and services related to the segment. Segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and material accounting changes other than those applied retrospectively, goodwill impairment, restructuring and other charges (with the exception of Oil & Gas), the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries. Segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges, non-operating benefit costs, income taxes, and preferred stock dividends according to how a particular segment's management is measured – excluded in determining segment profit for Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, Oil & Gas, Healthcare, Transportation and Lighting; included in determining segment profit, which we sometimes refer to as "net earnings," for Capital. Other income is included in segment profit for the industrial segments. Certain corporate costs, such as shared services, employee benefits and information technology are allocated to our segments based on usage. A portion of the remaining corporate costs is allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations. Industrial segment revenues and profit include the sum of our seven industrial reporting segments without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments and between these segments and our financial services segment. Total segment revenues and profit include the sum of our seven industrial segments and one financial services segment, without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments. We believe that this provides investors with a view as to the results of all of our segments, without inter-segment eliminations and corporate items.

Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP

We sometimes use financial measures derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The following non-GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure.

•Adjusted earnings (loss)

•Adjusted earnings (loss) per share (EPS)

•Adjusted GE Industrial profit and profit margin (excluding certain items)

•GE Industrial segment organic revenues 

•Healthcare organic revenues

•Adjusted Oil & Gas segment profit and profit margin

•GE Industrial free cash flows (FCF) and adjusted GE Industrial FCF

The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures follow. Certain columns, rows or percentages within these reconciliations may not add or recalculate due to the use of rounded numbers. Totals and percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.
