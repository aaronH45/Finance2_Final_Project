Explanatory Note:

On March 6, 2018, Celgene Corporation (the “Company”) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the “Initial Form 8-K”) to report the completion of its acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Juno”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 21, 2018 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Celgene, Juno and Blue Magpie Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene (“Purchaser”). On May 18, 2018, the Company filed Amendment No. 1 to amend the Initial Form 8-K to include the audited historical financial statements of Juno and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

The Company is filing this Amendment No. 2 on Form 8-K/A to include the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as referenced in Item 9.01 of this Form 8-K. The disclosures included in Amendment No. 1 otherwise remain unchanged.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits

(a) Pro forma financial information

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is presented as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2017 and combines the historical results of operations of Celgene and Juno for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Such unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is included as Exhibit 99.5 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

An unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2018 is not included in this Form 8-K as Juno is already included in Celgene’s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018.
