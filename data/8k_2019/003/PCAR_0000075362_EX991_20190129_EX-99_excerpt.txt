SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

This earnings release includes “adjusted net income (non-GAAP)” and “adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP)”, which are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), since they exclude the one-time tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") in 2017. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

Management utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding significant non-recurring items that are not representative of underlying operating trends.  

Reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures of: adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) are as follows:
