1 Full-year 2018 diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis reflects 555 percent growth. 

2 Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict the impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could significantly impact reported sales growth.
