Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP net loss included the one-time incremental income tax expense of $617 million related to the implementation of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

_____________________________

1 On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” or the New Revenue Standard, using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, adoption of the New Revenue Standard had a positive impact on revenue of $11 million, income from operations of $30 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.04 per share.

2 Non-GAAP diluted EPS and non-GAAP operating margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges and unusual items, and non-GAAP diluted EPS additionally excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax effect of the applicable adjustments. Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted Operating Margin exclude only unusual items, and Adjusted Diluted EPS additionally excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments. Constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period’s foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative period's reported revenues. Reconciliations of non-GAAP diluted EPS, Adjusted Diluted EPS, non-GAAP operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin to the corresponding GAAP measures are included at the end of this release.

“Cognizant executed well in 2018, diversifying our revenue base and client roster, and investing to build distinctive leadership in six advanced digital capabilities,” said Francisco D'Souza, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Forming the core of our digital strategy, these capabilities are instrumental in helping clients digitize and transform their entire enterprises, which we call being digital at scale. Digital continues to permeate and power every industry, creating a substantial market opportunity for us across the industries, geographies, and buyer groups we serve. With a disciplined plan for executing our digital strategy, we’ve set Cognizant up for the next stage of sustainable strong growth and value creation.”

•Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.57, compared to $3.77 in 2017.

Revenue for 2018 increased to $16.13 billion, up 8.9% from $14.81 billion for 2017. GAAP net income for 2018 was $2.10 billion, or $3.60 per diluted share, compared to $1.50 billion, or $2.53 per diluted share, for 2017. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.57 in 2018, compared to $3.77 in 2017. Adjusted Diluted EPS was $4.02 in 2018, compared to $3.42 in 2017. GAAP operating margin was 17.4%, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7% and Adjusted Operating Margin was 18.1% for 2018.

First Quarter & Full Year 2019 Outlook

The Company is providing the following guidance: 

▪First quarter 2019 year-over-year revenue growth of 7.5-8.5% in constant currency.4 

▪Full year 2019 year-over-year revenue growth of 7.0-9.0% in constant currency.4 

▪Full year 2019 Adjusted Diluted EPS5 expected to be at least $4.40.

“Our full year 2018 results reflect the on-going execution of our long-term strategy, which is expected to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth," said Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. "In 2018, we continued to focus on operational excellence to drive margin enhancement, while continuing to invest in the business. In addition, we introduced a more balanced capital return program to start in 2019.”

_____________________________

3 For the year ended December 31, 2018, adoption of the New Revenue Standard had a positive impact on revenue of $96 million, income from operations of $134 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.19 per share. 

4 Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect first quarter and full year 2019 revenue growth to be negatively impacted by 170 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively.

5 A full reconciliation of Adjusted Diluted EPS guidance to GAAP diluted EPS guidance on a forward-looking basis cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts, as we are unable to provide reconciling information with respect to unusual items, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses, and the tax effects of these adjustments, all of which are adjustments to Adjusted Diluted EPS.

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are 

necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. These statements include, but are not limited to, express or implied forward-looking statements relating to our plans and expectations surrounding the transition to a new CEO, our expectations regarding opportunities in the marketplace, investment in and growth of our business, our shift to digital services and solutions, our anticipated financial performance and our capital return program. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. Existing and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions, the failure of the new CEO to join the Company in the timeframe expected, or at all, changes in the regulatory environment, including with respect to immigration and taxes, and the other factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes references to the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, or non-GAAP diluted EPS, Adjusted Income From Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, or Adjusted Diluted EPS, free cash flow and constant currency revenue growth. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.

In 2018, we announced a plan to modify our non-GAAP financial measures. Our historical non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP diluted EPS, excluded stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges and unusual items, such as realignment charges and, in the second quarter of 2018, the initial funding of the Cognizant U.S. Foundation. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS additionally excluded net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and unusual items, such as the effect of the net income tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in the third quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, the effect of the recognition in the first quarter of 2017 of an income tax benefit previously unrecognized in our consolidated financial statements related to a specific uncertain tax position and the tax impacts of all applicable adjustments. Our new non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Income From Operations, exclude only unusual items and Adjusted Diluted EPS additionally excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments. The income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred. Additionally, we are introducing two new non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow and constant currency revenue growth. Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities net of purchases of property and equipment. Constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period’s foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative period's reported revenues.

Management believes providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the Company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use various GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Therefore, it is our belief that the use of non-GAAP financial measures excluding certain costs provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation in the following tables of our new non-GAAP financial measures (Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS, free cash flow and constant currency revenue growth) as well as our historical non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS) along with a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures, as applicable, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.

A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and may exclude costs that are recurring, namely stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, including amortization of purchased intangibles, and net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such non-GAAP financial measures.

(a)On January 1, 2018, we adopted the New Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective method. Upon adoption, we reclassified (i) balances representing receivables, as defined by the New Revenue Standard, from Unbilled accounts receivable to Trade accounts receivable, net and (ii) balances representing contract assets, as defined by the New Revenue Standard, from Unbilled accounts receivable to Other current assets.

Notes:

(a)On January 1, 2018, we adopted the New Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies. 

(b)Realignment charges include severance costs, lease termination costs, and advisory fees related to non-routine shareholder matters and to the development of our realignment and return of capital programs, as applicable. Our 2017 and 2018 realignment initiatives were targeted at improving our cost structure primarily by optimizing our resource pyramid. The total costs related to the realignment are reported in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in our consolidated statements of operations. We may continue to incur realignment charges in 2019. While we cannot provide realignment charges on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain, we expect to incur approximately $25 million in compensation and benefits costs associated with the CEO transition and the departure of our President in 2019. 

(c)During the second quarter of 2018, we provided $100 million of initial funding to Cognizant U.S. Foundation, which is focused on science, technology, engineering and math (or collectively, STEM) in the United States. This funding is not expected to recur at this magnitude in the foreseeable future.

(d)Stock-based compensation expense reported in: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(e)Acquisition-related charges include, amortization of purchased intangible assets included in the depreciation and amortization expense line on our consolidated statements of operations, external deal costs, acquisition-related retention bonuses, integration costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, charges for impairment of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, as applicable. 

(f)Non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses, inclusive of gains and losses on related foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, are reported in "Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net" in our consolidated statements of operations. Non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses are subject to high variability and low visibility and therefore cannot be provided on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts. 

(g)Presented below are the tax impacts of each of our non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate related to each of our non-GAAP adjustments varies depending on the jurisdictions in which such income and expenses are generated and the statutory rates applicable in those jurisdictions. 

(h)During the fourth quarter of 2017, in connection with the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, we recorded a one-time provisional net income tax expense of $617 million comprised of: (i) the one-time transitional tax expense on accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of $635 million and (ii) foreign and U.S. state income tax expense that will be applicable upon repatriation of the accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, other than our Indian subsidiaries, of $53 million, partially offset by (iii) an income tax benefit of $71 million resulting from the revaluation of U.S. net deferred income tax liabilities to the new lower U.S. income tax rate. During the third quarter of 2018, we finalized our calculation of this one-time net income tax expense and recognized a $5 million income tax benefit, which reduced our provision for income taxes.

(i)During the first quarter of 2017, we recognized an income tax benefit previously unrecognized in our consolidated financial statements related to a specific uncertain tax position of $55 million. The recognition of the benefit was based on management’s reassessment regarding whether this unrecognized tax benefit met the more-likely-than-not threshold in light of the lapse in the statute of limitations as to a portion of such benefit. 

The above tables serve to reconcile the Non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures. Please refer to the “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of our press release for further information on the use of these Non-GAAP measures.
