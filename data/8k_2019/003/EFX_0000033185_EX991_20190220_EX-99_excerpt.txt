Common Questions & Answers (Unaudited)

(Dollars in millions)

1. Can you provide a further analysis of operating revenue by operating segment?

Operating revenue consists of the following components:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 *Reflects percentage change in revenue conforming 2018 results using 2017 exchange rates.

10

2. What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?

Our effective income tax rate was a benefit of 6.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Our effective income tax rate was a benefit of 1.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The fourth quarter 2018 benefit was a result of adjustments recorded during the quarter to the provisional amounts recorded for the Tax Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 that more than offset the income tax expense recorded during the quarter. The 2017 benefit was due to the initial impact of the Tax Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Our effective tax rate was 14.0% and 19.9% for the full year 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in our effective income tax rate is due to the decrease in the statutory U.S. tax rate as a result of the Tax Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the increase in the benefit received from the reversal of uncertain tax positions. These changes were offset by an increase in the impact of equity compensation, an increase in the foreign rate differential impact, and the deferred tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the impact of the Tax Act.

3. What is the breakdown of costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident?

Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident are defined as incremental costs to transform our information technology infrastructure and data security; legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal, government and regulatory claims; as well as costs to provide the free product and related support to the consumer.

We recorded $104.6 million ($76.8 million, net of tax), and $326.2 million ($243.9 million, net of tax) for the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, for expenses, net of insurance, related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. The components of the costs are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a total of $134.6 million and $401.2 million, respectively, of pretax expenses related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and incremental technology and data security costs, exclusive of insurance recoveries. The $113.9 million and $307.2 million of technology and data security costs include incremental costs to transform our technology infrastructure and improve application, network, data security, and the costs of development and launch of Lock and Alert™. These include, but are not limited to, costs for people, professional and contracted services, technical services and products, and other costs added either directly or indirectly to manage, execute, and support the implementation of these plans. The $12.2 million and $73.6 million of legal and investigative fees include legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal, government, and regulatory investigations and claims related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. The $8.5 million and $20.4 million of product liability costs include the expected costs of fulfillment of TrustedID® Premier and support of consumers using TrustedID® Premier. Additionally, in 2018, the Company extended the free credit file monitoring services for impacted consumers using the free TrustedID® Premier service by providing them the opportunity to enroll in Experian® IDNotify™ at no cost for an additional twelve months.

Since the announcement of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we have incurred a total of $565.1 million of expenses, exclusive of insurance recoveries, related to the incident and incremental technology and data security costs.

We expect costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, excluding insurance recoveries, for 2019 to be less than the levels incurred in 2018.

At the time of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we had $125.0 million of cybersecurity insurance coverage, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to this incident. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded insurance recoveries of $75.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, and received payments of $110.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, for reimbursable costs incurred to date. 

11

Since the announcement of the 2017 cybersecurity incident in September 2017, we have received the maximum reimbursement under the insurance policy of $125.0 million.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures

Acquisition-related amortization expense, net of tax - During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $34.9 million ($29.9 million net of tax). We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $152.8 million ($129.2 million net of tax). We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles.

We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in significant cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax. Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. 

Income tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting or settlement - During the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively, related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. During the fourth quarter of 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $2.1 million and $26.7 million, respectively, related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs in accordance with newly adopted guidance. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding period in 2017, because this amount is non-operating and relates to income tax benefits or deficiencies for stock awards recognized when tax amounts differ from recognized stock compensation cost. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Accrual for costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident - During the third quarter of 2017, we reported that we were the target of a cybersecurity incident. We recorded $104.6 million ($76.8 million, net of tax) and $326.2 million ($243.9 million, net of tax) during the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, and $26.5 million ($12.0 million, net of tax) and $114.0 million ($71.3 million, net of tax) during the fourth quarter of 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, for costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident are defined as incremental costs to transform our information technology infrastructure and data security; legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal, government and regulatory claims; as well as costs to provide the free product and related support to the consumer. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Argentina highly inflationary foreign currency adjustment - Argentina experienced multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates. As such, Argentina has been deemed a highly inflationary economy by accounting policymakers. During the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, related to the impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of Argentina being a highly inflationary economy. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Legal settlement - During the third quarter of 2018, we recorded an $18.5 million ($14.1 million, net of tax) charge for a legal settlement that was not related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year 

20

ended December 31, 2018, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Charge related to the realignment of internal resources and other costs - During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a restructuring charge for the realignment of internal resources and other costs of $46.1 million ($35.0 million, net of tax) which predominantly relates to the reduction of headcount and the realignment of our internal resources to support the Company’s strategic objectives and increase the integration of our global operations. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018, since a charge of such amount for 2018 is not comparable among the periods.

Adjustments for uncertain tax positions - For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $14.1 million related to adjustments from uncertain tax positions resulting from a settlement with tax authorities for the 2016 and 2017 tax years. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $8.3 million related to adjustments from uncertain tax positions resulting from the completion of examinations of historical tax returns. Management believes excluding this tax effect from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018, since a charge of such amount for 2018 is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Veda acquisition related amounts for transaction expenses incurred as a direct result of the acquisition, as well as integration expense in the first year following the closure of the acquisition - For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $11.4 million ($9.0 million, net of tax) for Veda acquisition related amounts. $11.7 million related to transaction and integration costs in operating income, $0.3 million is recorded in other income, net and is the impact of foreign currency changes on the transaction structure. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Impact of tax legislation enacted in 2017 - During the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of new tax legislation, the company recorded one-time adjustments of $48.3 million for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets (liabilities), the deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards. Management believes excluding this tax effect from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2018, because a benefit of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin - Management defines adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income attributable to Equifax plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain one-time items.
