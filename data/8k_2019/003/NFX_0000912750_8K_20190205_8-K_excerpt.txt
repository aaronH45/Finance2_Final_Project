Other Events  

As previously disclosed, on October 31, 2018, Newfield Exploration Company (“Newfield”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Encana Corporation (“Encana”) and Neapolitan Merger Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Encana (“Merger Sub”), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Newfield, with Newfield surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Encana (the “Merger”). On January 8, 2019, Newfield filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a definitive proxy statement of Newfield and Encana filed with the SEC a prospectus and definitive proxy statement of Encana, for the solicitation of proxies in connection with the respective special meetings of Newfield’s stockholders and Encana’s shareholders, each to be held on February 12, 2019, for purposes of voting, among other things, on maters necessary to complete the Merger and for the issuance of Encana common shares in connection with the Merger (the “Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus”).  

Supplemental Disclosures in Connection with Stockholder Litigation in Connection with the Merger  

In connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, six purported class action complaints have been filed on behalf of Newfield stockholders against Newfield, members of the Newfield board of directors, and, in one complaint, Encana and Merger Sub in the United States District Courts for the District of Delaware and the Southern District of New York. The six complaints are captioned as follows: Stein v. Newfield Exploration Co., et al., Case 1:18-cv-02001 (D. Del.) (Dec. 17, 2018), Franchi v. Newfield Exploration Co., et al., Case 1:18-cv-02020 (D. Del.) (Dec. 19, 2018), Booth Family Trust v. Newfield Exploration Co., et al., Case 1:18-cv-02056 (D. Del.) (Dec. 27, 2018), Clay v. Newfield Exploration Co., et al., Case 1:19-cv-00018 (S.D.N.Y.) (Jan. 2, 2019), Farias v. Newfield Exploration Co., et al., Case 1:19-cv-00059 (D. Del.) (Jan. 9, 2019) and Wilks v. Newfield Exploration Co., et al., Case 1:19-cv-00134 (D. Del.) (Jan. 24, 2019), which Newfield and Encana refer to collectively as the “Stockholder Actions.” In general, the Stockholder Actions allege that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or aided and abetted in such alleged violations, because the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus allegedly omits or misstates material information. The Stockholder Actions seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees.  

Newfield, Encana and the other named defendants believe that no supplemental disclosures are required under applicable laws; however, to avoid the risk of the Stockholder Actions delaying the Merger and to minimize the expense of defending the Stockholder Actions, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Newfield and Encana are making certain disclosures below that supplement and revise those contained in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which Newfield and Encana refer to as the “litigation-related supplemental disclosures.” The litigation-related supplemental disclosures contained below should be read in conjunction with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which is available on the Internet site maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov, along with periodic reports and other information Newfield and Encana file with the SEC. Newfield, Encana and the other named defendants have denied, and continue to deny, that they have committed or assisted others in committing any violations of law, and expressly maintain that, to the extent applicable, they complied with their legal obligations and are providing the litigation-related supplemental disclosures below solely to try to eliminate the burden and expense of further litigation, to put the claims that were or could have been asserted to rest, and to avoid any possible delay to the closing of the Merger that might arise from further litigation. Nothing in the litigation-related supplemental disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the litigation-related supplemental disclosures set forth herein. To the extent that the information set forth herein differs from or updates information contained in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the information set forth herein shall supersede or supplement the information in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. All page references are to pages in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.  

The Newfield board of directors unanimously recommends that Newfield stockholders vote “FOR” the merger agreement proposal, “FOR” the non-binding compensation advisory proposal and “FOR” the Newfield adjournment proposal.  

The Encana board of directors unanimously recommends that Encana shareholders vote “FOR” the share issuance proposal and “FOR” the Encana adjournment proposal.  

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES TO DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT RELATED TO STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS  

The section of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus titled “The Merger” under the heading “Certain Newfield Unaudited Prospective Financial and Operating Information” is amended by:  

Inserting the following paragraphs after the first full paragraph on page 86:  

Forecasting Methodology. Newfield management applied uniform processes and methodologies across the different assets and liabilities of both Newfield and Encana to develop forecasts for each company. Numerous public and proprietary data sets on geology, operations and land were analyzed to generate assumption sets for each asset. Given the underlying uncertainty inherent to the geology, drilling and completion techniques used, production methods and variable market conditions, the expected production, operating costs   

 and capital cost assumptions were formed in ranges. In this way, the potential range of possible outcomes was analyzed and considered. As a result, the forecasts presented herein reflect the compounded effects of the assumption sets. Newfield management believes these forecasts provide the most likely outcomes based on the assumptions, data and knowledge at the time of examination. Newfield management believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable under the circumstances; however, different assumptions and estimates, as well as factors beyond Newfield management’s control, could result in different valuations being assigned to the individual assets and liabilities of both Newfield and Encana. Further detail on the individual components of Newfield management’s assumptions and estimates follows:  

Geology. The underlying geology was analyzed to determine the potential risks associated with an inventory of drilling locations to be used in the economic models for each asset. Maps with hydrocarbons in place, porosity, thickness, saturation, faulting, and other relevant characteristics based on logs and a framework analysis of the basin under study were examined for respective areas. Existing well results were used to ensure a correlation between estimated production and geology. Newfield management has developed and applied this proprietary methodology for many years ensuring consistency across the different basins in its portfolio.  

Subsurface operations. Newfield management used public and proprietary production, drilling and completion data, as well as its assessments of the associated geologic risk to develop assumptions for the inventory of future drilling locations by formation for each asset. Production type curves for each drilling location were based on underlying geologic characteristics and existing well data. The ultimate range of drilling location inventory used in formulating the projections reflects actual land configuration, geologic risk and specific drilling and completion design for both highly certain and less certain formations.  

Surface operations. Lease obligations, surface use considerations, facility costs, lease operating expenses, commodity price differentials and midstream contracts were used as inputs to compute the projected production levels and associated costs of the different assets within both Newfield and Encana. Similar to the assumptions used to formulate geologic and subsurface operations risks, ranges of uncertainty were incorporated into the assumptions for surface operations.  

When taken together, Newfield applied the above risks and estimated opportunities to both its and Encana’s development plans to generate production, revenue, EBITDAX and cash flow estimates by asset.
