TripAdvisor Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Financial Results  

NEEDHAM, MA, February 12, 2019 — TripAdvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRIP) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2018.  

“Our solid Q4 capped a very strong 2018,” said Chief Executive Officer Steve Kaufer. “We reinvigorated Hotel segment profitability, reinforced our leading positions in Experiences and Restaurants and laid important groundwork for future growth. We are pleased with our progress and will continue to balance growth and margin to deliver maximum shareholder value.”

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

n.m. = not meaningful 

(1)  

“Adjusted EBITDA”, “Non-GAAP Net Income”, “Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share”, and “Free cash flow” are non-GAAP measures as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for definitions and explanations of these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as tabular reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  

Chief Financial Officer Ernst Teunissen added, “We are very pleased with our strong Q4 and full year 2018 results. We expect double-digit consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth in 2019, with differentiated revenue and profit focus by segment.”  

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Financial Summary 

•  

Q4 Total Revenue accelerated to 8% growth, or $346 million. Full year Total Revenue grew 4% to approximately $1.62 billion. We estimate that changes in foreign currency had a 1% negative impact on Total Revenue growth in Q4 and a 1% positive impact on Total Revenue growth in the full year of 2018. 

•  

Q4 GAAP Net Income grew to $7 million and full year GAAP Net Income grew to $113 million. This increase year-over-year was primarily due to $73 million in additional tax expense related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017 that did not reoccur in 2018, partially offset by expenses of $5 million attributed to a legal settlement in the fourth quarter of 2018. See below for a further discussion of the 2017 Tax Act, and changes to our Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP Net Income definitions in the fourth quarter of 2018 to exclude legal reserves and settlements.  

•  

Q4 Non-GAAP Net Income grew 375% to $38 million. Full year Non-GAAP Net Income grew 67% to $240 million.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 

On December 22, 2017, U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”) was enacted into law. The new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings (the “Transition Tax”) and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Changes in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a charge totaling $73 million related to our then-current estimate of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, principally due to the Transition Tax. The Transition Tax, recorded at $67 million and which will not accrue interest, will be paid over an eight-year period, of which $31 million remained unpaid at December 31, 2018. We also recorded a charge of $6 million  

2 

for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets. These estimates, as of December 31, 2017, were reflected in our financial results in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118"), which provided for a measurement period of one year to complete the accounting for certain elements of the 2017 Tax Act. The impact of subsequent adjustments recorded during the measurement period by the Company during the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 was not material.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP in our press release and related conference call or webcast, we also report certain non-GAAP financial measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company’s financial statements. We may use the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, free cash flow, non-GAAP revenue before effects of foreign exchange, and Adjusted EBITDA before effects of foreign exchange.  

The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of TripAdvisor’s liquidity. Investors are cautioned that there is material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, many of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of certain items, as defined in our non-GAAP definitions below, which are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even where similarly titled, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes and therefore should not be used to compare TripAdvisor’s performance to that of other companies. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP financial measures.  

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management to operate and analyze our business over different periods of time. 

We define our non-GAAP financial measures as below: 

TripAdvisor defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as Net Income (Loss) plus: (1) provision for income taxes; (2) other income (expense), net; (3) depreciation of property and equipment, including amortization of internal use software and website development; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) stock-based compensation and other stock-settled obligations; (6) goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible asset impairments; (7) legal reserves and settlements; and (8) non-recurring expenses and income. These items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount is not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company revised its Adjusted EBITDA definition to exclude legal reserves and settlements, as the Company believes these costs are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. The Company believes that excluding these amounts better enables management and investors to compare financial results between periods as these costs may vary independent of business performance. This revision to our Adjusted EBITDA definition did not have a material impact on our segment or non-GAAP financial results for any period prior to the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, and therefore no reclassifications have been made to conform the prior periods to the current period presentation. This revision had no effect on GAAP results in any period. 

TripAdvisor defines “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.  

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key operating performance measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the financial performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and on which internal budgets and forecasts are based and approved. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors and allows for another useful comparison of our performance with our historical results from prior periods.  

Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other GAAP results.  

Some of these limitations are:  

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  

8 

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;  

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation or other stock-settled obligations;  

•  

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;  

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain income and expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our business, such as legal reserves and settlements; 

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and  

•  

Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.  

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP net income” as GAAP net income (loss) excluding, net of their related tax effects (which excludes the impact of significant one-time changes resulting from tax legislation such as the 2017 Tax Act): (1) stock-based compensation expense and other stock-settled obligations; (2) amortization of intangible assets; (3) goodwill, intangible asset, and other long-lived asset impairments; (4) legal reserves and settlements; and (5) certain gains, losses, and other non-recurring income or expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating results. We believe non-GAAP net income is an operating performance measure which provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, as it incorporates our condensed consolidated statement of operations, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of certain expenses, infrequently occurring items and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, and also enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company revised its non-GAAP net income definition to exclude legal reserves and settlements, as the Company believes these costs are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. The Company believes this change better enables management and investors to compare financial results between periods as these costs may vary independent of business performance. This revision to our non-GAAP net income definition did not have a material impact on our segment or non-GAAP financial results for any period prior to the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, and therefore no reclassifications have been made to conform the prior periods to the current period presentation. This revision had no effect on GAAP results in any period. 

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP net income per diluted share”, or non-GAAP diluted EPS, as non-GAAP net income divided by GAAP diluted shares. We believe non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, our condensed consolidated statement of operations, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, interest income, income taxes and foreign exchange gains or losses, but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. TripAdvisor calculates non-GAAP diluted EPS using GAAP diluted shares determined under the treasury stock method. 

Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS have some of the same limitations as Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, non-GAAP net income does not include all items that affect our net income and GAAP diluted EPS for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

TripAdvisor defines “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which are purchases of property and equipment, including capitalization of internal-use software development costs. We believe this financial measure can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business, as it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate free cash flow along with the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 

TripAdvisor calculates our foreign exchange effect of revenue, or “non-GAAP revenue before effects of foreign exchange” on a constant currency basis by excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange on revenue by translating actual revenue for the current year three months ended using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates. We believe this is a useful measure that facilitates management's internal comparison to our historical performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of our core operating results.

TripAdvisor calculates our foreign exchange effect of Adjusted EBITDA, or “Adjusted EBITDA before effects of foreign exchange,” on a constant currency basis, by excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange by translating all amounts included in Adjusted EBITDA for the current year three months ended using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates. We believe this is a useful measure that facilitates management's internal comparison to our historical performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of our core operating results. 

Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, we present reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure below.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company revised its Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income definitions to exclude legal reserves and settlements. Refer to our Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income definitions above under the section “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more discussion. This revision to our definition did not have a material impact to our segment information or any of our non-GAAP measures for any period prior to the three months and year ended December 31, 2018. Therefore no reclassifications have been made to conform the prior periods to the current period presentation. This revision had no effect on GAAP results in any period. 

(2)  

TripAdvisor defines “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. 

(3)  

The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments was calculated based on the individual impact that these items had on our GAAP consolidated income tax expense for the periods presented.  

(4)  

Represents an expense for income taxes related to the 2017 Tax Act of $73 million recorded during both the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017; as discussed above under the section “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.” The Company also recorded an incremental income tax benefit of $2 million during the fourth quarter December 31, 2018, with no net impact for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the 2017 Tax Act. 

(5)  

Includes potential dilutive effect of common equivalent shares as if the Company had generated net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 when calculating non-GAAP diluted EPS given the Company had non-GAAP net income; but a GAAP net loss in those periods. 

(6)  

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP net income per diluted share” as non-GAAP net income divided by GAAP diluted shares.  

(7)  

Represents constant currency growth, as a percentage, which is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues and Adjusted EBITDA figures over prior period revenues and Adjusted EBITDA figures, where current period figures are translated using prior period foreign currency exchange rates.
