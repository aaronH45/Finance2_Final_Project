 Item 5.04.  

Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant’s Employee Benefit Plans.  

On January 29, 2019, Newfield Exploration Company (the “Company” or “Newfield”) received a notice from the administrator of the Newfield Exploration Company 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”). The notice stated that the Newfield Exploration Company Stock Fund (the “Newfield Stock Fund”) in the Plan will be entering a blackout period due to the expected acquisition of Newfield by Encana Corporation (the “Acquisition”) and the administrator’s need to cease transaction capability in advance of the Acquisition. During the blackout period, participants in the Plan will be unable to borrow or take distributions from their Newfield Stock Fund under the Plan, or direct or diversify any Plan investments in the Newfield Stock Fund. The blackout period will commence on February 4, 2019 and is targeted to end on February 13, 2019. The Company is unable to determine the closing date of the Acquisition and it is therefore unable to determine the exact date that the blackout period will end.  

In accordance with Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation BTR, on January 29, 2019, the Company sent a notice to its directors and executive officers notifying them of the blackout period in the Newfield Stock Fund and certain trading prohibitions that they will be subject to during the blackout period. A copy of the notice that was sent by the Company to its directors and executive officers is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  

Inquiries relating to the blackout period may be directed to Benjamin J. Paul by telephone at (281) 210-5100 or by mail at 4 Waterway Square Place, Ste. 100, The Woodlands, TX 77380.
