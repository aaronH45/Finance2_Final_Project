Mr. Helderman will also serve on our Board as a member of the Board’s Executive Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees.

Mr. Helderman retired from his position at Sasco Capital Inc. as managing director and co-portfolio manager on January 31, 2019.

From 1989 to 1996, Mr. Helderman worked in equity research and sales for Roulston Research Company and from 1986 to 1989 he worked in equity research and sales at McDonald & Company, both in Cleveland, Ohio.

Mr. Helderman has more than 30 years of experience in the U.S. equities markets, including engagement with senior management teams to develop a deep understanding of their corporate vision, value creation philosophy, commitment to long-term sustainable value and shareholder alignment. In addition to his portfolio management role, Mr. Helderman has been an analyst with broad experience in the commodity, energy, industrial and utility sectors for more than 20 years.

There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Helderman and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Helderman was selected as a director. Mr. Helderman has no direct or indirect interest in any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
