VULCAN ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER 2018 RESULTS 

Fourth Quarter Earnings from Continuing Operations were $0.93 per Diluted Share 

Aggregates Gross Profit Increases 24 Percent and Unit Profitability Expands 

Double-digit Earnings Growth Expected in 2019 

Birmingham, Alabama – February 14, 2019 – Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates, today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018. 

Net earnings were $124 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $286 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, net earnings were $516 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $1.132 billion (an increase of 15 percent) despite significantly higher energy costs. 

Tom Hill, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our fourth quarter results reflect a strong finish to the year. Solid shipment growth, compounding price improvements and strong operating efficiencies in our aggregates business contributed to double-digit growth in revenues and operating earnings. Aggregates pricing continued its upward momentum, and unit profitability expanded further despite higher costs for diesel fuel. This demonstrates the resiliency of our aggregates-centric business model. Our conversion of incremental aggregates sales into aggregates earnings was strong again in the fourth quarter – contributing to a same-store segment gross profit flow-through rate of 64 percent for the year. 

“Our aggregates-focused business is well positioned for further gains in our industry-leading unit profitability in aggregates. Since the recovery began in the second half of 2013, our core operating and sales disciplines have contributed to 13 percent average annual growth in aggregates gross profit per ton. We expect double-digit earnings growth again in 2019, given the strength of our operational performance and continuing growth in public sector demand. Aggregates pricing momentum continues to improve. Mix-adjusted pricing in the fourth quarter increased 5 percent, and we expect price growth in 2019 at a similar rate. 

“In our key markets across the United States, we are benefitting disproportionally from both strong growth in public construction demand and continued solid growth in private demand. For 2019, we expect reported earnings from continuing operations of between $4.55 and $5.05 per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA of between $1.250 and $1.330 billion.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  

Fourth quarter and full-year highlights include the following: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Fourth quarter and full year 2017 results include a one-time, non-cash benefit of $268 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  

Segment Results 

Aggregates 

Fourth quarter segment gross profit increased 24 percent to $256 million, or $5.16 per ton. As a percentage of segment sales, gross profit margin expanded from 26.8 percent in the prior year to 29.3 percent due to solid growth in shipments, compounding price improvements and cost control. For the full year, segment gross profit increased 16 percent to $992 million, or $4.93 per ton. 

Full year, same-store incremental gross profit was 64 percent of incremental segment sales excluding freight and delivery, in-line with longer-term expectations of 60 percent. As a reminder, quarterly gross profit flow-through rates can vary widely from quarter to quarter; therefore, the Company evaluates this metric on a trailing-twelve month basis. 

Fourth quarter aggregates shipments increased 8 percent (4 percent on a same-store basis) versus the prior year quarter. Daily shipping rates in October and November were slowed by Hurricane Michael and wet weather in Texas and a number of Southeastern markets. Strong shipment growth continued in Alabama, Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Shipment growth in Texas and Virginia rebounded after weather-related interruptions in September and October. Full year aggregates shipments increased 10 percent (6 percent on a same-store basis) led by double-digit growth in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Tennessee and Texas. Most other key markets realized flat-to-modest growth in full year shipments as compared to the prior year. In Virginia, volumes declined 9 percent due mostly to wet weather experienced throughout the first half of the year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  

For the quarter, freight-adjusted average sales price for aggregates increased 2 percent versus the prior year’s quarter, with the growth rate negatively affected by strong shipment growth in relatively lower-priced markets such as Alabama, Arizona and Illinois. Excluding mix impact, aggregates price increased 5 percent versus the prior year’s fourth quarter. Throughout 2018, pricing momentum continued to improve as the year-over-year growth rate in average sales price increased each quarter. For the year, freight-adjusted aggregates pricing increased 1.4 percent. On a mix-adjusted basis, pricing increased 3.5 percent versus the prior year. Positive trends in backlogged project work along with demand visibility, customer confidence, and logistics constraints support continued upward pricing movements in 2019. 

Fourth quarter same-store unit cost of sales (freight-adjusted) decreased compared to the prior year quarter as fixed cost leverage and other operating efficiencies more than offset a 17 percent increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel. For the year, same-store unit cost of sales (freight-adjusted) decreased 2 percent, more than offsetting a 25 percent increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel. The Company remains focused on compounding improvements in unit margins throughout the cycle through fixed cost leverage, price growth and operating efficiencies. Since the recovery began in the second half of 2013, gross profit per ton in aggregates has compounded at an average annual growth rate of 13 percent. 

Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium 

Asphalt segment gross profit of $7 million for the fourth quarter was $16 million lower than the prior year’s quarter due to lower material margins. Although asphalt mix selling prices increased 7 percent in the fourth quarter, or $3.74 per ton, a 54 percent increase in unit costs for liquid asphalt more than offset the price improvement. Full year segment gross profit was $56 million versus $91 million in the prior year. For the full year, higher liquid asphalt costs negatively affected segment earnings by $54 million. Pricing gains are beginning to offset higher liquid asphalt costs, but their impact will be gradual during 2019. 

Concrete segment gross profit improved slightly for the quarter versus the prior year’s fourth quarter. Same-store shipments decreased 7 percent year-over-year. Shipment growth in California partially offset lower shipments in Virginia (the Company’s largest concrete market) and Texas due in part to wet weather. Same-store average price increases of 3 percent led to a 5 percent gain in same-store material margins. Full year segment gross profit increased 10 percent to $50 million. 

Calcium segment gross profit was $0.5 million approximating the prior year’s fourth quarter. Full year segment gross profit increased 10 percent to $2.7 million. 

Capital Allocation and Financial Position 

For the full year, capital expenditures were $469 million. This amount included $222 million of core operating and maintenance capital investments to improve or replace existing property, plant and equipment. In addition, the Company invested $247 million in internal growth projects to secure new aggregates reserves, develop new production sites, enhance the Company’s distribution capabilities, and support the targeted growth of its asphalt and concrete operations. During 2019, the Company expects to spend approximately $250 million on maintenance capital and $200 million for internal growth projects that are largely underway.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  

The Company remains active in the pursuit of bolt-on acquisitions and other value-creating growth investments. The Company closed four acquisitions during 2018 for cash consideration of $221 million. These acquisitions complement our existing positions and expand our capabilities in Alabama, California, and Texas markets. 

Full year pretax interest expense, net was $137 million versus $291 million in the prior year. The prior year included pretax charges of $153 million associated with debt refinancing activity. 

During the year, the Company returned $282 million to shareholders, compared to $193 million in the prior year, through dividends and share repurchases. At year end, total debt was $2.9 billion, or 2.6 times full year Adjusted EBITDA compared to 2.9 times at the prior year end. 

For 2018, net earnings were $516 million, and the business generated approximately $925 million of after-tax cash flows from earnings (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less working capital change (excluding cash and debt), operating and maintenance capital, and cash taxes). 

The Company’s capital allocation and investment-grade rating priorities remain unchanged. 

Selling, Administrative and General (SAG) Expenses and Taxes 

SAG expenses in the quarter were $84 million, slightly lower than the prior year. For the full year, SAG expense was $333 million, or 7.6 percent as a percentage of total revenues, down from 8.4 percent in 2017. The Company remains focused on further leveraging its overhead cost structure. 

Tax expense for the year was $105 million (effective tax rate of 16.9 percent) compared to the prior year tax benefit of $232 million. The prior year’s fourth quarter tax benefit included $268 million of net benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 and $29 million of benefit tied to state-level net operating loss carryforwards. 

Demand and Earnings Outlook 

Regarding the Company’s outlook Mr. Hill stated, “We delivered strong incremental earnings in 2018 and are well positioned to carry that momentum forward this year. We expect solid growth in private demand and strong growth in public demand. Above-average demand growth in Vulcan markets compared to the rest of the U.S. further supports our positive outlook for shipment growth. The underlying direction of unit profitability remains clear, strongly supported by our strategic and tactical focus on compounding pricing improvements. We expect double-digit earnings growth in 2019.”

1. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 

Aggregates segment freight-adjusted revenues is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) measure. We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight & delivery, which are pass-through activities. It also excludes immaterial other revenues related to services, such as landfill tipping fees, that are derived from our aggregates business. Additionally, we use this metric as the basis for calculating the average sales price of our aggregates products. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: 

Aggregates Segment Freight-Adjusted Revenues 

(in thousands, except per ton data) 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

1 At the segment level, freight & delivery revenues include intersegment freight & delivery (which are eliminated at the consolidated level) and freight to remote distribution sites. 

Aggregates segment gross profit margin as a percentage of segment sales excluding freight & delivery (revenues and costs) is not a GAAP measure. We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight & delivery, which are pass-through activities (we do not generate a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the product). Incremental gross profit as a percentage of segment sales excluding freight & delivery represents the year-over-year change in gross profit divided by the year-over-year change in segment sales excluding freight & delivery. Reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented below:

GAAP does not define "Aggregates segment cash gross profit" and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We and the investment community use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business. Additionally, we present this metric as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. Aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton is computed by dividing Aggregates segment cash gross profit by tons shipped. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:

Appendix 2 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures (Continued) 

GAAP does not define "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization" (EBITDA) and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. We adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of earnings performance from period to period. Additionally, we present the metric After Tax Cash Flow from Earnings to assess the operating performance of our business and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Reconciliation of these metrics to their nearest GAAP measure are presented below: 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

Similar to our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, we present Adjusted Diluted EPS to provide a more consistent comparison of earnings performance from period to period. 

Adjusted Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations (Adjusted Diluted EPS) 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following reconciliation to the mid-point of the range of 2019 Projected EBITDA excludes adjustments (as noted in Adjusted EBITDA above) as they are difficult to forecast (timing or amount). Due to the difficulty in forecasting such adjustments, we are unable to estimate their significance. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:
