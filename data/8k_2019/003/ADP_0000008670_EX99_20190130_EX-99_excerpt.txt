ROSELAND, N.J. – January 30, 2019 – ADP® (Nasdaq: ADP), a leading global provider of Human Capital Management (HCM) solutions, today announced its second quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and updated its fiscal 2019 outlook.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Consolidated Results

Compared to last year’s second quarter, revenues increased 8% to $3.5 billion, 8% organic constant currency. Earnings before income taxes increased 26% to $741 million. Net earnings decreased 17% to $558 million, and adjusted net earnings increased 29% to $587 million. Adjusted EBIT increased 26% to $787 million, representing adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 320 basis points in the quarter to 22.4%, including approximately 30 basis points of pressure from acquisitions. Adjusted EBIT margin expansion was driven by continued execution of transformation initiatives and by operating efficiencies. ADP’s effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, and 24.6% on an adjusted basis. Diluted EPS decreased 16% to $1.27 due to a higher effective tax rate compared to the prior year, which included a one-time net tax benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 30% to $1.34 due to the factors discussed above as well as a net share count reduction.

“Technology and service are the core components to our success, and our focused investments in our strategic platforms are having the desired effect,” said Carlos Rodriguez, President and Chief Executive Officer, ADP. “We are especially pleased with the progress of our transformation initiatives, which are supporting our commitment to stay at the forefront of the HCM industry and maximize value for all of our stakeholders.”

“The continued strong execution of our strategy had a positive effect on our margins this quarter,” said Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer, ADP. “Through our ongoing transformation initiatives we have been able to better allocate resources where we see the greatest opportunity, while also realizing net efficiencies in our overall cost base.”

Client Funds Extended Investment Strategy Fiscal 2019 Outlook

The interest assumptions in our outlook are based on Fed Funds futures contracts and forward yield curves as of January 29, 2019. The Fed Funds futures contracts used in the client short and corporate cash interest income outlook assume no further increases during the fiscal year. The three-and-a-half and five-year U.S. government agency rates based on the forward yield curves as of January 29, 2019 were used to forecast new purchase rates for the client and corporate extended, and client long portfolios, respectively.

•Interest on funds held for clients up $90 to $100 million. This is based on anticipated growth in average client funds balances of about 4% from $24.3 billion in fiscal 2018, and an average yield which is anticipated to increase about 30 basis points to 2.2% compared to the fiscal 2018 average yield of 1.9%.
