Item 2.02Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On February 20, 2019, The Southern Company (“Southern Company”) issued a press release regarding its earnings for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.07 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Exhibits 99.01, 99.02, 99.03 and 99.04 to this Current Report on Form 8-K include earnings and earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These exhibits also include earnings and earnings per share (1) for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excluding (a) charges and an income tax credit related to plants under construction, (b) earnings from the Wholesale Gas Services business of Southern Company Gas, (c) acquisition, disposition and integration impacts, and (d) additional net tax benefits and expense as a result of implementing federal tax reform legislation; (2) for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, excluding (a) a charge for the write-down of Gulf Power Company’s ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 and (b) earnings associated with equity return as a result of extending the construction schedule for Mississippi Power Company's integrated coal gasification combined cycle project in Kemper County, 

Mississippi beyond November 30, 2016; and (3) for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, excluding settlement proceeds of Mississippi Power Company's claim for lost revenue resulting from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The attached exhibits include additional information regarding these excluded items, as well as reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable financial measure under GAAP. Southern Company believes the presentation of earnings and earnings per share, excluding these items, is useful to investors because it provides investors with additional information to evaluate the performance of Southern Company’s ongoing business activities. Southern Company management also uses earnings and earnings per share, excluding the effect of these items, to evaluate the performance of Southern Company’s ongoing business activities. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
