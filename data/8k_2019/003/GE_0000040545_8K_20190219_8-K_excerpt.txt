On February 19, 2019, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of General Electric Company (“GE” or the “Company”) elected Catherine Lesjak, the former Chief Financial Officer of HP, Inc., to the Board, effective March 1, 2019.

Ms. Lesjak served most recently as Interim Chief Operating Officer of HP from July 1, 2018 to January 1, 2019. She served as Chief Financial Officer of HP from January 1, 2007 to July 1, 2018, and also served as Interim Chief Executive Officer from August 6, 2010 to November 1, 2010. She will retire from HP on February 28, 2019. The Board concurrently increased its size to 12 directors and Ms. Lesjak will fill the resulting vacancy.
