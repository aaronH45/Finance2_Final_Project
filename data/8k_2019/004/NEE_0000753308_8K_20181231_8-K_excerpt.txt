SECTION 2 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant 

On December 31, 2018, NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH), a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE), borrowed $1.125 billion under each of four separate bi-lateral term loan agreements (collectively, the loan agreements) for a total of $4.5 billion, the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the purchase price payable by NEE for the acquisition of Gulf Power Company (Gulf Power). Amounts outstanding under the loan agreements mature on June 25, 2019. Interest will be based on the Eurodollar Rate plus a specified margin that is subject to adjustment depending upon the length of time the loans are outstanding, with interest payable at the end of each interest period, which are expected to range from one to six months, as selected by NEECH. Each of the loan agreements contains default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, the failure to make required payments or to observe other covenants in the loan agreement, including financial covenants relating to the ratio of NEE’s and its consolidated subsidiaries’ funded debt to total capitalization, and certain bankruptcy-related events. NEE guarantees the payment of debt obligations under the loan agreements pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement.

The cash purchase price was funded through the issuance of debt as discussed in Item 2.03.
