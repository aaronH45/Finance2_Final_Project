WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, February 20, 2019 - CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) today announced operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018.

President and Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo stated, “2018 was a milestone year for CVS Health as we successfully completed our transformational merger with Aetna, began effective implementation of our integration strategy, and took important steps toward building the integrated healthcare model that will bring substantial value to our various stakeholders. We had strong financial performance and delivered on our operating expectations.”

“With the completion of the Aetna acquisition, we have set the stage for CVS Health to excel in a market that is rapidly transforming. We strongly believe in the long-term value that the full breadth of our capabilities can provide. Our unique combination will drive above-market growth going forward across all of the enterprise. Maintaining our focus on community-level products and services will drive meaningful value for both consumers and payors, while improving our bottom line and the value we return to shareholders. Ultimately, our open platform model allows us to meet the needs of all payors with newly created products and services. We’re more excited than ever about the opportunities that lie ahead.”

_____________________________________________ 

(1)Effective for the fourth quarter of 2018, interest income was reclassified from interest expense, net to net investment income within revenues to conform with insurance company presentation. Accordingly, revenues and operating income have been revised for all prior periods presented to conform with the current presentation. See Supplemental Information starting on page 15.

(2)In 2019, adjusted operating income will also exclude the amortization of intangible assets. See Supplemental Information on page 21.

Consolidated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]_____________________________________________ 

(1)Refer to additional information on non-GAAP financial measures later in this release.

(2)Enterprise prescriptions include prescriptions dispensed through our retail pharmacies, long-term care pharmacies, and mail order pharmacies as well as prescription claims managed through our pharmacy benefit manager, with an elimination for managed prescription claims filled through CVS Health dispensing channels. Includes an adjustment to convert 90-day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.

(3)Refer to page 20 for additional detail on medical membership.

•As a result of the acquisition of Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”), which closed November 28, 2018, the Company established a new Health Care Benefits segment, which is the equivalent of the former Aetna Health Care segment. Certain aspects of Aetna’s operations, including products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term care products, are included in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Operating income declined in both the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to the goodwill impairment charges in the Retail/LTC segment discussed below.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Net loss for both the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 was driven primarily by the goodwill impairment charges in the Retail/LTC segment discussed below, the majority of which are not deductible for income tax purposes, and the increase in interest expense due to the 2018 financing associated with the acquisition of Aetna.

Pharmacy Services Segment

The Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management services to employers, health plans, government employee groups and government sponsored programs. The segment results for the three months and years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

Retail/LTC Segment

The Retail/LTC segment fulfills prescriptions for medications, provides patient care programs, sells a wide-assortment of general merchandise, provides health care services through walk-in clinics and provides services to long-term care facilities. The segment results for the three months and years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]_____________________________________________ 

(1)Includes an adjustment to convert 90-day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Front store revenues remain approximately 23% of total Retail/LTC segment revenues. Front store revenues increased in the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increases in health product sales.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The LTC business has continued to experience industry wide challenges that have impacted our ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the Company acquired Omnicare, Inc. in 2015. These challenges include lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities, significant deterioration in the financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in 2018, and continued facility reimbursement pressures. As a result of these challenges, a goodwill impairment charge of $3.9 billion was recorded during the second quarter of 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the LTC reporting unit missed its forecast primarily due to operational issues and customer liquidity issues, including one significant customer bankruptcy. Additionally, LTC management submitted an updated final budget for 2019 which showed significant additional deterioration in the reporting unit’s projected financial results for 2019 compared to the analysis performed in the second quarter of 2018, primarily due to continued industry and operational challenges, which also caused management to make further updates to their long term forecast beyond 2019. Based on these updated financial projections, management determined that there were indicators that the goodwill of the LTC business may be further impaired, and accordingly, an interim goodwill impairment test was performed as of December 31, 2018. The results of the impairment test showed that the fair value of the LTC business was lower than the carrying value resulting in a $2.2 billion goodwill impairment charge. In addition to the lower financial projections, lower market multiples of the peer group companies contributed to the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.

Refer to supplemental information on page 19 for additional information regarding the performance of the Retail/LTC segment.

Health Care Benefits Segment

On November 28, 2018, CVS Health completed the acquisition of Aetna. The Health Care Benefits segment is equivalent to the former Aetna Health Care segment. The Health Care Benefits segment provides a full range of insured and self-insured (“ASC”) medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health products and services. The segment results for the period from November 28, 2018 to December 31, 2018 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Revenues and operating income for the Health Care Benefits segment include results for the period from November 28, 2018 to December 31, 2018 and therefore are not directly comparable to the former Aetna Health Care segment results for the fourth quarter of 2017. 

•Medical membership as of December 31, 2018 remained relatively consistent compared with September 30, 2018, reflecting decreases in Commercial insured and Medicaid products, largely offset by increases in Commercial ASC and Medicare products.

Refer to supplemental information on page 20 for additional information regarding the performance of the Health Care Benefits segment.

2019 Guidance

The Company’s full year 2019 consolidated GAAP operating income is projected to be in the range of $11.7 billion to $12.1 billion while adjusted operating income is projected to be in the range of $14.8 billion to $15.2 billion. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is projected to be in the range of $4.88 to $5.08, and Adjusted EPS is projected to be in the range of $6.68 to $6.88. The adjustments between GAAP operating income and GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations and adjusted operating income and Adjusted EPS include adding back amortization of intangible assets and integration costs related to the acquisition of Aetna. The Company expects to continue to generate strong cash flows in 2019, with projected cash flow from operations between $9.8 billion and $10.3 billion. 

Mr. Merlo added, “2019 will be a year of transition as we integrate Aetna and focus on key pillars of our growth strategy. We are fully aware of the need to address the impact of certain headwinds that are having a disproportionate impact in 2019 compared to prior years, and importantly, we are taking comprehensive actions to move past them. We understand acutely the importance of balancing near-term execution with longer-term vision, and we are confident that our actions will position us well in 2020 and beyond.”

Non-GAAP Financial Information

Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented in the tables later in this press release.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following tables provide reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company is also providing reconciliations of certain non-GAAP information on a prospective basis. The Company uses the non-GAAP measures “Adjusted Operating Income,” “Adjusted EPS” and “Free Cash Flow” to assess and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Management believes that providing these non-GAAP measures enhances investors’ understanding of the Company’s performance.

For 2018 and 2017, the Company defines Adjusted Operating Income as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, gains/losses and transaction costs on divestitures, interest income on financing associated with proposed acquisitions (for periods prior to the acquisition), charges in connection with store rationalization, and any other items specifically identified herein. For 2019, the Company defines Adjusted Operating Income as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, gains/losses and transaction costs on divestitures, interest income on financing associated with proposed acquisitions (for periods prior to the acquisition), charges in connection with store rationalization, and any other items specifically identified herein. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure enhances investors’ ability to compare past financial performance with its current and expected performance. 

The Company defines Adjusted Earnings per share, or Adjusted EPS, as income before income tax provision (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, gains/losses and transaction costs on divestitures, net interest expense on financing associated with proposed acquisitions (for periods prior to the acquisition), losses on settlements of defined benefit pension plans, charges in connection with store rationalization, and any other items specifically identified herein, divided by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted EPS for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 is calculated utilizing weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which include 5 million and 3 million, respectively, potential common shares, as the impact of the potential common shares was dilutive. The potential common shares were excluded from the calculation of GAAP loss per share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, as the shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect as a result of the GAAP net loss incurred in both periods. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure enhances investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance.

The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net additions to property and equipment (i.e., additions to property and equipment plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal comparisons and finds it useful in assessing year-over-year cash flow performance.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Operating Income should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, operating income. Adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income before income tax provision as a measure of our performance. Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The Company’s definitions of Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.

Adjusted Operating Income

(Unaudited)

The following is a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_____________________________________________ 

(1)Effective for the fourth quarter of 2018, interest income was reclassified from interest expense, net to net investment income within revenues to conform with insurance company presentation. Accordingly, operating income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 has been revised to include net investment income. 

(2)In 2018 and 2017, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Aetna and Omnicare. 

(3)In 2018, the goodwill impairments relate to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. In 2017, the goodwill impairments relate to the RxCrossroads reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment.

(4)The impairment of long-lived assets primarily relates to the impairment of property and equipment within the Retail/LTC segment.

(5)In 2018, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of the Company’s RxCrossroads subsidiary for $725 million on January 2, 2018. In 2017, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents transaction costs associated with the sale of RxCrossroads. 

(6)Charges in connection with store rationalization primarily represent charges for noncancelable lease obligations associated with stores closed in connection with the Company’s enterprise streamlining initiative.

(7)The three months and year ended December 31, 2018 include interest income of $83 million and $536 million, respectively, related to the $40 billion of senior notes issued on March 9, 2018 (“2018 Senior Notes”). All such amounts are for the periods prior to the close of the acquisition of Aetna, which occurred on November 28, 2018.

(2)In 2018, the goodwill impairments relate to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. In 2017, the goodwill impairments relate to the RxCrossroads reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment.

(3)The impairment of long-lived assets primarily relates to the impairment of property and equipment within the Retail/LTC segment.

(4)In 2018, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of the Company’s RxCrossroads subsidiary for $725 million on January 2, 2018. In 2017, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents transaction costs associated with the sale of RxCrossroads. 

(5)Charges in connection with store rationalization primarily represent charges for noncancelable lease obligations associated with stores closed in connection with the Company’s enterprise streamlining initiative.

(6)The three months and year ended December 31, 2018 include interest expense of $280 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, related to (i) bridge financing costs, (ii) interest expense on the $40 billion of 2018 Senior Notes and (iii) the $5 billion term loan facility. The interest expense was reduced by related interest income of $83 million and $536 million, respectively, earned on the proceeds of the 2018 Senior Notes. The three months and year ended December 31, 2017 each include interest expense of $56 million related to bridge financing costs. All amounts are for the periods prior to the close of the acquisition of Aetna, which occurred on November 28, 2018.

(7)The Company computes its adjusted income tax provision after taking into account items excluded from adjusted income before income tax provision. The nature of each non-GAAP adjustment is evaluated to determine whether a discrete adjustment should be made to the adjusted income tax provision. The adjusted income tax provision for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, excludes the approximately $1.5 billion income tax benefit associated with the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017.

(8)Adjusted earnings per share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 are calculated utilizing weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which include 5 million and 3 million, respectively, potential common shares, as the impact of the potential common shares was dilutive. The potential common shares were excluded from the calculation of GAAP loss per share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, as the shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect as a result of the GAAP net loss incurred in both periods.

The Company evaluates its Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Health Care Benefits segment performance based on operating income and operating income before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities. 

In conjunction with the Company’s implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in the first quarter of 2018, the Company changed the manner in which certain shared functional costs are allocated to its reportable segments. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of Aetna on November 28, 2018, the Company reclassified interest income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 from interest expense, net to net investment income within revenues to conform with insurance company presentation.
