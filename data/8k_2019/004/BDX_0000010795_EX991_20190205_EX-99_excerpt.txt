•The company reaffirms its full fiscal year 2019 revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance.

Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 5, 2019) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $4.160 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018. This represents an increase of 35.1 percent from the prior-year period, which is primarily due to the acquisition of C. R. Bard. On a comparable, currency-neutral basis, revenues increased 5.2 percent over the prior-year period.

“We are very pleased with our strong start to fiscal year 2019. As noted in our pre-announcement, results were better than expected across all three segments,” said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chairman and CEO. “It is evident that the combination of BD and C. R. Bard is delivering value to customers, patients and shareholders around the world.”

First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Operating Results

As reported, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $2.05, compared with $(0.76) in the prior-year period. This represents an increase of 369.7 percent and is primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Advanced Bioprocessing business, and net expense related to U.S. tax reform in the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.70, compared with $2.48 in the prior-year period. This represents an increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 8.9 percent, or 14.9 percent on a currency-neutral basis. 

Segment Results

In the BD Medical segment, as reported, worldwide revenues for the quarter of $2.135 billion increased 15.3 percent from the prior-year period, primarily due to the acquisition of C. R. Bard. On a comparable, currency-neutral basis, BD Medical revenues increased 5.2 percent over the prior-year period. The segment’s results were driven by strong performance in the Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units.

In the BD Life Sciences segment, as reported, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $1.056 billion. This represents an increase of 1.0 percent over the prior-year period. On a comparable, currency-neutral basis that excludes the revenues associated with the divested Advanced Bioprocessing business, BD Life Sciences revenues of $1.047 billion increased 4.7 percent over the prior-year period. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong performance in the Preanalytical Systems unit. 

In the BD Interventional segment, as reported, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $0.970 billion. On a comparable, currency-neutral basis, revenues increased 5.7 percent over the prior-year period. The segment's results reflect strong performance in the Surgery and Urology and Critical Care units. Growth in the Peripheral Intervention unit reflects a tough comparison to the prior-year period.

Geographic Results

As reported, first quarter revenues in the U.S. of $2.387 billion increased 44.1 percent from the prior-year period, primarily due to the acquisition of C. R. Bard. On a comparable basis, U.S. revenues increased 6.0 percent over the prior-year period. Growth in the U.S. was driven by strong performance from all three segments.

As reported, revenues outside of the U.S. of $1.773 billion increased 24.6 percent from the prior-year period, primarily due to the acquisition of C. R. Bard. On a comparable, currency-neutral basis, revenues outside of the U.S. increased 4.1 percent over the prior-year period. International revenue growth was driven by strong performance in China and the rest of Asia, as well as Latin America.

Fiscal 2019 Outlook for Full Year

The company reaffirms previously issued fiscal year 2019 revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance. 

As reported, the company expects full fiscal year 2019 revenues to increase 8.5 to 9.5 percent, primarily due to the C. R. Bard acquisition. The company estimates full fiscal year 2019 revenues will increase 5.0 to 6.0 percent on a comparable, currency-neutral basis.

The company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $12.05 and $12.15, resulting in growth of approximately 13.0 to 14.0 percent on a currency-neutral basis. This represents growth of approximately 10.0 percent, including the estimated unfavorable impact of foreign currency, over fiscal 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $11.01.

Estimated adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 excludes potential charges or gains that may be recorded during the fiscal year, such as, among other things, the non-cash amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related charges, and certain tax matters. BD does not attempt to provide reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP earnings guidance to the comparable GAAP measure because the impact and timing of these potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts. In addition, the company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of BD's financial performance. 

Conference Call Information

A conference call regarding BD’s first quarter results will be broadcast live on BD’s website, www.bd.com/investors, along with related slides, at 8:00 a.m. (ET) Tuesday, February 5, 2019. The conference call will be available for replay on BD’s website, www.bd.com/investors, or at 1-800-585-8367 (domestic) and 1-404-537-3406 (international) through the close of business on Tuesday, February 12, 2019, confirmation number 7064558.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures/Financial Tables

This news release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these and other non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial tables. Within the attached financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts.

All “comparable” basis revenue growth rates relating to fiscal year 2019 presented throughout this release include, where applicable, the results of C. R. Bard, Inc. (“Bard”) in the prior-year period, and also include adjustments for certain items as detailed in the attached tables. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company's organizational structure was based upon three 

principal business segments: BD Medical (“Medical”), BD Life Sciences (“Life Sciences”) and BD Interventional ("Interventional"). The Interventional segment was added upon the Company's completion of its acquisition of Bard, and this new segment includes the majority of Bard’s product offerings and certain product offerings that were previously reported in the Medical segment. Certain of Bard's product offerings are included under the Company's Medical segment, specifically within the new Medication Delivery Solutions unit, which was formerly the Medical segment's Medication and Procedural Solutions unit. Prior-year amounts have been revised to reflect the movement of certain product offerings that were previously reported in the Medical segment and that are now reported in the Interventional segment, as discussed above. Current and prior-year adjusted diluted earnings per share results exclude, among other things, the impact of purchase accounting adjustments (including the non-cash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets); integration, restructuring and transaction costs; and the loss on debt extinguishment. We also provide these measures on a currency-neutral basis after eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation, where applicable. We calculate foreign currency-neutral percentages by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. Reconciliations of these amounts to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the tables at the end of this release.
