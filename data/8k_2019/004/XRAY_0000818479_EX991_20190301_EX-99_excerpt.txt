York, Pennsylvania, March 1, 2019 - DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (“Dentsply Sirona”) (Nasdaq: XRAY), The Dental Solutions Company, today announced its preliminary financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.

Preliminary Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Results

Reported net sales of $1,059.7 million declined 2.9% compared to $1,091.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and declined 0.1% on an internal sales growth basis. Revenues saw solid increases in Europe, up 4.6% (+8.7% on an internal sales growth basis), and in the Rest of World, up 1.4% (+7.1% on an internal sales growth basis). This was partially offset by declines in the U.S., down 14.7% (-16.3% on an internal sales growth basis), driven by expected high levels of dealer destocking during the quarter. 

Net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $1.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $650.4 million, or $2.85 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. On an adjusted basis, excluding certain items, non-US GAAP net earnings per diluted share were $0.58 compared to $0.82 in the fourth quarter of 2017. A reconciliation of the non-US GAAP measures to earnings per share calculated on a US GAAP basis is provided in the attached tables.

Fourth quarter Consumable revenues increased by 3.4% and increased by 5.4% on an internal sales growth basis. Consumable segment revenue growth benefited from a recovery in shipment levels at our European distribution center in Venlo, the Netherlands.

Technology & Equipment revenues declined by 7.4% in the fourth quarter of 2018, down 4.1% on an internal sales growth basis. Fourth quarter Technology & Equipment revenues were impacted by $31 million of inventory destocking, as compared to inventory stocking of $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding inventory stocking and destocking in both quarters, Technology & Equipment fourth quarter internal revenues would have increased as compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. 

Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona, commented: “Although fiscal 2018 financial results were disappointing, we have taken important steps to position the company for improved

1

 financial performance. We have completed a top to bottom diagnostic of the Company and are executing a major restructuring plan to accelerate growth, improve margins and simplify our business.” 

Mr. Casey continued: “There has been progress in multiple areas. We are operating under our new simplified organizational framework that included consolidation of our dental product groups, our regional commercial groups, and a centralized supply chain. Additionally, our focused R&D efforts have delivered a significant innovation in PrimeScan, with more innovative new products following later this year. The Company's portfolio shaping efforts resulted in the sale or exit of three underperforming business. We have also started the difficult, but necessary process of reducing our employee base by 6% to 8%, and are well on our way to achieving the targets we shared in November of 2018. The entire management team is confident that this is the right direction for Dentsply Sirona. It will allow us to drive improved operating performance and to deliver for our customers, our employees, our partners, and our shareholders.”

Preliminary Full Year 2018 Financial Results

Reported net sales of $3,986.3 million as compared to $3,993.4 million in 2017 and declined 1.8% on an internal sales growth basis. 2018 sales were negatively impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $100 million due to inventory destocking at our dealer partners. In 2017, sales benefited from $27 million of inventory build in the channel. 

Net loss attributable to Dentsply Sirona for 2018 was $1,011.0 million, or a loss of $4.51 per share, compared to a net loss of $1,550.0 million, or $6.76 per diluted share in 2017. On an adjusted basis, excluding certain items, non-US GAAP earnings per diluted share in 2018 were $2.01 compared to $2.66 in 2017. A reconciliation of the non-US GAAP measures to earnings per share calculated on a US GAAP basis is provided in the attached table.

2019 Guidance [2]

Management initiated 2019 guidance and anticipates 2019 Adjusted Earnings Per Share in the range of $2.25 to $2.40.  The 2019 guidance incorporates the following assumptions:

•Portfolio shaping initiatives that have already been executed reduce 2019 revenues by approximately $70 million. 

•At current exchange rates, currency is anticipated to be a 2.5% headwind to 2019 revenues, reducing 2019 reported revenues by approximately $100 million.

•Internal sales growth of 4%-5%. 2019 internal revenues benefit from absence of dealer destocking and 2019 new product introductions. 

•Reported revenues of $3.95 to $4.05 billion.

•Operating expenses below 2018 levels.

•Non-US GAAP effective tax rate of 22.4%.

•Adjusted EPS in the range of $2.25 to $2.40, up 12% to 19% as compared to 2018.

Filing of Form 12b-25

We announced today that we will be filing our 2018 Form 10-K after today’s deadline. We need additional time to review the accounting results and internal controls of a business that is being shut down as part of our portfolio shaping initiatives. This business is immaterial to our consolidated net sales. We anticipate filing our Form 10-K next week.

[1] Non-US GAAP adjusted EPS, net sales excluding precious metal, constant currency growth and internal sales growth and results are non-US GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items. Please refer to the disclosure at the end of the release. For a reconciliation of constant currency growth to internal sales growth please see supplemental tables at the end of the release.

[2] Our guidance is presented on a non-US GAAP basis, as it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, acquisitions announced but not yet closed and other non-US GAAP items, including restructuring costs, many of which are difficult to predict. Therefore, we cannot provide a full reconciliation of these measures. The Company is unable at this time to address the probable significance of all of the unavailable information.

Non-US GAAP Financial Measures

The principal measurements used by the Company in evaluating its business are: (1) constant currency sales growth by segment and geographic region; (2) internal sales growth by segment and geographic region; and (3) adjusted operating income and margins of each reportable segment, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting, corporate expenses, and certain other items to enhance the comparability of results period to period. These principal measurements are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; therefore, these items represent non-US GAAP measures. These non-US GAAP measures may differ from other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

The Company defines “constant currency” sales growth as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding precious metal content and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This impact is calculated by comparing current-period revenues to prior-period revenues, with both periods converted at the U.S. dollar to local currency foreign exchange rate for each month of the prior period, for the currencies in which the Company does business. The Company defines “internal” sales growth as constant currency sales growth excluding the impacts of net acquisitions and divestitures, Merger accounting impacts and discontinued products.

Management believes that the presentation of net sales, excluding precious metal content, provides useful information to investors because a portion of Dentsply Sirona’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the Company’s precious metal dental alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials. Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the cost of the precious metal content of the Company’s sales is largely passed through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, Dentsply Sirona reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. The Company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales, as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers. The Company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change.

In addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona and adjusted earnings per diluted common share (“adjusted EPS”). The Company discloses adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company and certain large non-cash charges related to intangible assets either purchased or acquired through a business combination. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation.

Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income and adjusted EPS and the performance of the Company is measured on this basis along with other performance metrics.

The adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona consists of net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona adjusted to exclude the following:

(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to integrating and consummating mergers and recently acquired businesses, as well as costs, gains and losses related to the disposal of businesses or significant product lines. In addition, this category includes the roll off to the consolidated statements of operations of fair value adjustments related to business combinations, except for amortization expense noted below. These items are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends.

(2) Restructuring program related costs and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives as well as certain other costs. These costs can include, but are not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract terminations costs, related professional service costs, duplicate facility and labor costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives, as well as, legal settlements and impairments of assets. These items are irregular in timing, amount and impact to the Company’s financial performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded for the purpose of understanding underlying operating trends.

(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. Amortization expense has been excluded from adjusted net income attributed to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding these large non-cash charges.

(4) Credit risk and fair value adjustments.  These adjustments include both the cost and income impacts of adjustments in certain assets and liabilities including the Company’s pension obligations, that are recorded through net income which are due solely to the changes in fair value and credit risk. These items can be variable and driven more by market conditions than the Company’s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.

(5) Gain on sale of marketable securities. This adjustment represents the gain on the sale of marketable securities held by the Company. The gain has been excluded from adjusted net income attributed to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding this gain.

(6) Income tax related adjustments. These adjustments include both income tax expenses and income tax benefits that are representative of income tax adjustments mostly related to prior periods, as well as the final settlement of income tax audits, and discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation. These adjustments are irregular in timing and amount and may significantly impact the Company’s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.

Adjusted earnings per diluted common share is calculated by dividing adjusted net (loss) income attributable to Dentsply Sirona by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona and adjusted earnings per diluted common share are considered measures not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and therefore are non-US GAAP measures. These non-US GAAP measures may differ from other companies. Income tax related adjustments may

 include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate. The non-US GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
