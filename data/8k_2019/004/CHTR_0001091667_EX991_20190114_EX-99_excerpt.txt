Ladies and Gentlemen:  

Charter Communications Operating, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Company”), and Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation (“CCO Capital” and, together with the Company, the “Issuers”), propose, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, to issue and sell to the underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the “Underwriters”) (i) an aggregate of $1,250,000,000 principal amount of 5.050% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) and (ii) an aggregate of $750,000,000 principal amount of 5.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2048 (the “2048 Notes” and, together with the 2029 Notes, the “Notes”). Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. have agreed to act as representatives (the “Representatives”) on behalf of the several Underwriters. The 2029 Notes will be issued pursuant to that certain Indenture dated as of July 23, 2015 (the “Base Indenture”) among the Issuers and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and as collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Collateral Agent”), as supplemented by the twelfth supplemental indenture to be dated as of January 17, 2019 (the “Closing Date”) (the “Twelfth Supplemental Indenture”) among the Issuers, the Guarantors (as defined below), the Trustee and the Collateral Agent. The 2048 Notes will be issued pursuant to an officers’ certificate and an authentication order, in each case, to be dated as of the Time of Delivery (as defined below) (collectively, the “Officers’ Certificate”) to be delivered in accordance with the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the ninth supplemental indenture dated as of April 17, 2018 (the “Ninth Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture and the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture, the “Indenture”) among the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent. CCO Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Parent Guarantor”) and each subsidiary of the Company (other than CCO Capital) that is a guarantor under the Company’s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2017, as further amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or oth-   

 erwise modified (the “Credit Agreement”) (which, as of the date hereof, are the subsidiaries listed on Schedule II hereto) (together with the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors”) will guarantee (the “Guarantees” and, together with the Notes, the “Securities”) the obligations of the Issuers under the Indenture.  

The Issuers previously entered into an underwriting agreement with the representatives of the several underwriters named therein, dated as of April 3, 2018 (the “April 2018 Underwriting Agreement”) and have previously issued $1,700,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of their 5.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2048 under the Indenture (the “Existing Notes”). The 2048 Notes, when issued, will constitute an offering of “Additional Notes” (as such term is defined in the Indenture) under the Indenture. Except as otherwise described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus Supplement (each as defined below), the 2048 Notes will have identical terms to the Existing Notes and will be treated as a single class of notes for all purposes under the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, this Underwriting Agreement does not amend or supersede the April 2018 Underwriting Agreement.  

The Issuers and the Guarantors have prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-222241), as amended, including a prospectus (the “Base Prospectus”). The Issuers have also filed, or propose to file, with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act a prospectus supplement relating to the Securities (the “Prospectus Supplement”). Such registration statement, as amended at the time it became effective, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness (“Rule 430 Information”), is referred to herein as the “Registration Statement”; and as used herein, the term “Prospectus” means the Base Prospectus as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement in the form first used (or made available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with the confirmation of sales of the Securities and the term “Preliminary Prospectus” means the preliminary prospectus supplement dated January 14, 2019 specifically relating to the Securities together with the Base Prospectus. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Base Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference to “amend,” “amendment” or “supplement” with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the “Exchange Act”) that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.  

Pursuant to the Security Documents, the Securities will be secured by a first priority lien on the Collateral (as defined in the Time of Sale Information (as defined below)), subject to certain exceptions and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Security Documents. The Notes will have the benefit of certain security as provided in the Security Documents. The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral shall be further governed by the Intercreditor Agreement dated as of May 18, 2016 among the Company, the other grantors party thereto, the Collateral Agent and the collateral agent for the lenders under the Credit Agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”).

9. Indemnification and Contribution.  

(a) Indemnification of the Underwriters. The Issuers and the Guarantors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, agents, employees, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus, any of the other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Investor Presentation or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the state- 

-19-   

 ments therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Issuers in writing by such Underwriter through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. expressly for use therein;  

(b) Indemnification of the Issuers and the Guarantors. Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless each Issuer, the Guarantors, each of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members, managers and agents, and each person, if any, who controls an Issuer or the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Issuers in writing by such Underwriter through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any of the other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus the fourth sentence of the second paragraph, the third paragraph, the second sentence of the fourth paragraph and the first through fifth sentences of the sixth paragraph under the heading “Underwriting;”  

(c) Notice and Procedures. If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the “Indemnified Person”) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the “Indemnifying Person”) in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 9 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 9. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 9 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which if raised in a proceeding involving both parties would be inappropriate under applicable legal or ethical standards due to actual or potential differing interests between it and the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable legal or ethical standards due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemni- 

-20-   

 fying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Issuers, the Guarantors and any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members, managers and agents and any control persons of the Issuers and the Guarantors, as applicable, shall be designated in writing by the Issuers. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, not subject to further appeal, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability provided for in such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person;  

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Issuers from the sale of the Securities and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, as provided in this Agreement, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers or the Guarantors on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission;  

(e) Limitation on Liability. The Issuers, the Guarantors and the Underwriters each agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be  

-21-   

 deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters’ obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint; and  

(f) Non-Exclusive Remedies. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.  

10. Default by an Underwriter.  

(a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Issuers shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Issuers that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Issuers notify you that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Issuers shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Issuers agree to prepare promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term “Underwriter” as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities;  

(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Issuers as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Issuers shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default; and  

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Issuers as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Issuers shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase  

-22-   

 Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Issuers or the Guarantors, except for the expenses to be borne by the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.  

11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Issuers, the Guarantors and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its affiliates, agents, employees, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or the Issuers, the Guarantors, or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members, managers and agents, and each person, if any, who controls an Issuer or the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities or the termination of this Agreement.  

12. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Issuers, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and on or prior to the Time of Delivery (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuers, the Guarantors or Charter shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery, of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus; or (v) there shall have occurred any major disruption of settlements of securities, payment, or clearance services in the United States or any other country where such securities are listed.  

13. Reliance and Notices. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you jointly or by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. on behalf of you as Underwriters.  

All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters (or any of them) shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to you as Underwriters (or an Underwriter) to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, Attention: General Counsel, facsimile number 1-646-291-1469 and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. at 60 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005, Attention: Debt Capital Markets, with a copy to General Counsel, facsimile number 1-646-374-1071, and if to the Issuers shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Issuers set forth in the Prospectus, Attention: Secretary. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.  

14. Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Issuers, the Guarantors and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members, managers and agents of the Issuers and the Guarantors and the affiliates, agents, employees, directors and officers of the Underwriters and each person who controls the Issuers or any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securi- 

-23-   

 ties Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.  

15. Timeliness. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.  

16. Authority of the Representatives. Any action by the Underwriters hereunder may be taken by any Representative on behalf of the Underwriters, and any such action taken by such Representative shall be binding upon the Underwriters.  

17. Applicable Law. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.  

18. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts (which may include counterparts delivered by any standard form of telecommunication), each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.  

19. Headings. The headings herein are included for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of, or to affect the meaning or interpretation of, this Agreement.  

20. Recognition of the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes.  

(a) In the event that any Underwriter that is a Covered Entity (as defined below) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime (as defined below), the transfer from such Underwriter of this Agreement, and any interest and obligation in or under this Agreement, will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Agreement, and any such interest and obligation, were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.  

(b) In the event that any Underwriter that is a Covered Entity or a BHC Act Affiliate (as defined below) of such Underwriter becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights (as defined below) under this Agreement that may be exercised against such Underwriter are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Agreement were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.  

(c) For purposes of this Section 20, (i) the term “BHC Act Affiliate” has the meaning assigned to the term “affiliate” in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. § 1841(k); (ii) “Covered Entity” means any of the following: (x) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b), (y) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b), or a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b); (iii) “Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable; and (iv) “U.S. Special Resolution Regime” means each of (x) the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (y) Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
