The active success rate records the percentage of times a fund beat its designated benchmark, net of fees and trading costs, over a specified time period. We’ve defined a positive active success rate as a fund beating the performance of its designated benchmark in more than half of the periods measured. Sources: T.

Morningstar includes both active and passive funds in their analysis. 2Outperforming passive peers data: Passive peer performance is based upon a representative fund that most closely aligns with the T. Rowe Price fund and is included in fund’s Morningstar category. The representative peer was chosen based upon one or more of the following: largest AUM, tenure of share class, key statistical data including duration, credit quality and benchmarks. The list of representative peers selected is available on page 56 in the Appendix. Analysis includes only those funds with passive peers - 26 US fixed income funds for the 3-year and 5-year periods; 15 in the 10-year period. 3The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the respective fund’s I Class and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, The I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher. T. ROWE PRICE GROUP, INC.

Past performance cannot guarantee future results. 1Value added (net of fees and other costs) is calculated by comparing the returns of the Retirement 2005–2060 Fund’s sector-weighted benchmarks versus the respective S&P Target Date Index. Returns were then aggregated to show the total excess returns for each Retirement Fund sector-weighted benchmark. Excess returns were calculated for each rolling period and then averaged across all the periods in each time frame. 2Value added is calculated by comparing the returns of the 11 Retirement Funds with a 10-year track record using each fund’s fixed strategic asset allocation versus the returns based on the actual allocation weights. 3Value added—net of fees and other costs—is calculated for the underlying funds in the 11 Retirement Funds with a 10-year track record. Returns were calculated relative to each underlying fund’s style-specific benchmark. Returns were then aggregated to show the total excess returns for each Retirement Fund. Excess returns were calculated for each rolling period and then averaged across all the periods in each time frame. 1,2,3For each of the 3 design components, to provide a high-level summary, a time-weighted performance average was calculated to determine the percentage of the total rolling periods in each time frame in which the design component made a positive contribution to fund returns. Value added is the return contribution made by each design component. Excess returns were calculated for each rolling period and then averaged across all the periods in each time frame. T.

Rowe Price investment products, net of elimination of its (6.5) (6.7) (6.5) related management and administrative fees1 Compensation expense related to market valuation changes in supplemental savings plan — (11.7) 5.6 liability2 Recoveries (nonrecurring charge) related (66.2) 50.0 15.2 to Dell appraisal rights matter3 Adjusted Operating Expenses $2,478.7 $2,777.7 $3,025.5 12.1% 8.9% 1The non-GAAP adjustments add back the management fees that we earn from the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products and subtract the investment income and operating expenses of these products that have been included in our U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. We believe the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products may impact the reader's ability to understand our core operating results. 2This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact of market movements on the supplemental savings plan liability beginning July 1, 2017. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by the employees. Since we economically hedge the exposure to these market movements, we believe it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income earned on the hedges against the related compensation expense to increase comparability period to period. 3Operating expense impact related to nonrecurring charges/recoveries associated with the Dell appraisal rights matter. We believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for these nonrecurring charges and recoveries in arriving at adjusted operating expenses. T.

Morningstar Fee Level: Morningstar evaluates a mutual fund share class's expense ratio relative to other funds that invest in a similar asset class and have similar distribution characteristics. Within each Comparison Group, a fund share class' expense ratio is ranked against peers using five quintiles.
