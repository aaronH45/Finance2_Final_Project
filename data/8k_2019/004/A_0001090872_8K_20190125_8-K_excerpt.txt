Item 8.01 Other Events.

As of November 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs, which amends ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits, to require employers that present a measure of operating income in their statements of operations to include only the service cost component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in operating expenses. The service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost should be presented in the same operating expense line items as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, including interest costs, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost/credit and actuarial gains/losses, and settlement and curtailment effects, are to be included separately and outside of any subtotal of operating income. This guidance impacted the presentation of our condensed consolidated statements of operations with no impact on net income. As adoption is required to be on a retrospective basis, we are furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide our historical condensed consolidated statements of operations and selected segment information presented herein. 

This Current Report on Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings. The information contained in this report, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of Section 18.
