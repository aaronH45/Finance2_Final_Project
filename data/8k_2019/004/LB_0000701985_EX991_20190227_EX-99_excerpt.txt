NOTES TO RECONCILIATION OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

(Unaudited)

The “Adjusted Financial Information” provided in the attached reflects the following non-GAAP financial measures:

Fiscal 2018

In the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted results exclude the following:

•A $99.2 million ($55.1 million net of tax of $44.1 million) loss on the sale of La Senza to an affiliate of Regent LP.

In the third quarter of 2018, adjusted results exclude the following:

•An $80.9 million charge ($72.7 million net of tax of $8.2 million), included in buying and occupancy expenses, related to the impairment of certain Victoria’s Secret store assets.

•$20.3 million ($15.0 million net of tax of $5.3 million) of Henri Bendel closure costs, included in buying and occupancy expenses ($13.8 million) and general, administrative and store operating expenses ($6.5 million). 

In the first and second quarter of 2018, there were no adjustments to results.

Fiscal 2017

In the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted results exclude the following:

•A $45.0 million pre-tax loss ($28.8 million net of tax of $16.2 million), included in other income (loss), associated with the early extinguishment of our June 2019 notes.

In the first, second and third quarters of 2017, there were no adjustments to results.

The Adjusted Financial Information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Further, the Company’s definition of adjusted income information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. While it is not possible to predict future results, management believes the adjusted information is useful for the assessment of the ongoing operations of the Company because the adjusted items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. Additionally, management uses adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. The Adjusted Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the Company’s historical financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K.
