McKESSON REPORTS FISCAL 2019 THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS  

   •    

Revenues of $56.2 billion for the third quarter, up 5% year over year.  

   •    

Third-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.41.  

   •    

Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $3.40, flat year over year.  

   •    

Fiscal 2019 Outlook: Adjusted Earnings of $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share.  

SAN FRANCISCO, January 31, 2019 – McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the third quarter ended December 31, 2018, were $56.2 billion, up 5% compared to $53.6 billion a year ago, and also up 5% on a constant currency basis. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), third-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.41, compared to earnings per diluted share of $4.32 a year ago. Prior year GAAP earnings per diluted share included a net tax benefit of approximately $1.78 per diluted share driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  

Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.40, flat compared to $3.41 a year ago, primarily driven by a lower share count and growth in our Medical-Surgical business, offset by a higher tax rate and lower profit contribution from our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, which includes a $60 million, or approximately $0.23 cents per diluted share, charge related to a customer bankruptcy and previously announced customer losses.  

For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $141 million, and invested $405 million internally, resulting in negative free cash flow of $264 million, which was in line with the company’s expectations. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson also paid $866 million for acquisitions, repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of its common stock, paid $216 million in dividends and the company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion.

“Our third-quarter results reflect solid adjusted operating profit performance, particularly in our Medical-Surgical and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions businesses, and we are pleased with the progress we are seeing in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Canadian businesses as we work to offset headwinds we discussed when providing our fiscal year outlook in May,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer, McKesson Corporation. “Our year-to-date results provide momentum heading into our fiscal fourth quarter, positioning the company well as Brian Tyler assumes the role of chief executive officer on April 1, 2019.”  

Segment Results  

U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions revenues were $44.3 billion for the quarter, up 6%, driven primarily by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously announced customer losses and branded to generic conversions. Segment GAAP operating profit was $671 million and GAAP operating margin was 1.52%. Segment adjusted operating profit was $593 million and adjusted operating margin was 1.34%.  

European Pharmaceutical Solutions revenues were $6.9 billion for the quarter, down 1% on a reported basis and up 2% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by market growth, partially offset by the previously disclosed reduction in owned retail pharmacies and a challenging operating environment in the U.K. Segment GAAP operating profit was $26 million and GAAP operating margin was 0.38%. Segment adjusted operating profit was $69 million and adjusted operating margin was 1.00%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was $71 million and adjusted operating margin was 0.99%.  

Medical-Surgical Solutions revenues were $2.0 billion for the quarter, up 19%, driven primarily by an acquisition and market growth. Segment GAAP operating profit was $136 million and GAAP operating margin was 6.76%. Segment adjusted operating profit was $170 million and adjusted operating margin was 8.45%.

Revenues included in Other were $3.0 billion for the quarter, up 1% on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by market growth. Other GAAP operating profit was $74 million and adjusted operating profit was $224 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was $226 million.  

Fiscal Year 2019 Outlook  

McKesson now expects Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $13.45 to $13.65 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, from the previous range of $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share.  

McKesson does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as the company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure without unreasonable effort, as items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control.  

Dividend Declaration  

The company’s Board of Directors yesterday declared a regular dividend of thirty-nine cents per share of common stock. The dividend will be payable on April 1, 2019, to stockholders of record on March 1, 2019.

Adjusted Earnings  

McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment charges, and other adjustments. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.  

The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis prospectively as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.

Constant Currency  

McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis. The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.  

Free Cash Flow  

McKesson also provides free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures, as outlined in the company’s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company’s financial results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), McKesson Corporation (the “Company” or “we”) also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press release. The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company’s Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles—Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations and/or the formation of joint ventures and equity method investments.  

Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments—Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, and other transaction-related costs including initial public offering costs. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency contracts entered into directly due to acquisitions, gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.  

LIFO inventory-related adjustments—LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.  

Gains from antitrust legal settlements—Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.  

Restructuring and asset impairment charges—Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from the Adjusted Earnings.  

Other adjustments—The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and from dispositions of assets; other asset impairments; adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses and settlements; certain discrete benefits and subsequent true-up adjustments related to the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.  

Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Income Taxes,” which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.  

Additionally, our equity method investments’ financial results are adjusted for the above noted items.  

2 of 2  

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
