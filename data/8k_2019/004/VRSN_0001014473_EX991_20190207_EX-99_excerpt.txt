Verisign reported net income of $582 million and diluted EPS of $4.75 in 2018, compared to net income of $457 million and diluted EPS of $3.68 in 2017. The operating margin for 2018 was 63.2 percent compared to 60.7 percent in 2017. 

2018 Non-GAAP Financial Results

On Dec. 5, 2018, Verisign completed the previously announced sale of the rights, economic benefits, and obligations, in all customer contracts related to its Security Services business to NeuStar, Inc. The sale resulted in a pre-tax, non-operating gain of $54.8 million, which for fourth quarter and full year 2018, increased GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income by $52.0 million and $42.8 million, respectively. The gain increased GAAP diluted EPS and non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.43 and $0.36 in the fourth quarter and by $0.43 and $0.35 for full year 2018. These increases are included in the results above.

“2018 was a strong year for Verisign. The domain name base and revenues grew; we divested non-core assets; and we repurchased 4.4 million of our shares. Significantly, in October, we executed an amendment to the Cooperative Agreement with the Department of Commerce, which gives Verisign the approval to engage with ICANN to amend the .com Registry Agreement to allow Verisign to increase .com domain name registration and renewal fees. The amendment also provides regulatory reduction that allows for a standard renewal of the .com Registry Agreement, which occurs every six years, to proceed without review and approval by the Department of Commerce” said Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.

•Verisign ended 2018 with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $1.27 billion, a decrease of $1.15 billion from year-end 2017.

Business Highlights

•On Oct. 26, 2018, Verisign and the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”) entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, which, among other items, permits Verisign, without further approval of the DOC, to agree with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) to change the .com Registry Agreement to increase wholesale prices for .com domain names up to 7 percent in each of the last four years of each six-year period of the .com Registry Agreement.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA

Verisign provides quarterly and annual financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Along with this information, management typically discloses and discusses certain non-GAAP financial information in quarterly earnings news releases, on investor conference calls and during investor conferences and related events. This non-GAAP financial information does not include the following types of financial measures that are included in GAAP: stock-based compensation, unrealized gain/loss on the contingent interest derivative on the subordinated convertible debentures, non-cash interest expense through June 30, 2018, and loss on debt extinguishment. Non-GAAP net income is decreased by amounts accrued for contingent interest payable through Aug. 15, 2017, related to the subordinated convertible debentures, and is adjusted for an income tax rate of 22 percent starting from the first quarter of 2018, 25 percent for the second through the fourth quarters of 2017, and 26 percent for the first quarter of 2017, all of which differ from the GAAP income tax rate.

On a quarterly basis, Verisign also provides Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in accordance with the terms of the indentures governing Verisign’s senior notes. Adjusted EBITDA refers to net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, unrealized gain/loss on hedging agreements, gain on the sale of a business, and loss on debt extinguishment.

Management believes that this non-GAAP financial data supplements the GAAP financial data by providing investors with additional information that allows them to have a clearer picture of Verisign’s operations and financial performance and the comparability of Verisign’s operating results from period to period. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The tables appended to this release include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial information to the comparable financial information reported in accordance with GAAP for the given periods.
