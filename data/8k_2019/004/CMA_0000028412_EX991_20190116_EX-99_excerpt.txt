COMERICA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2018 NET INCOME OF $310 MILLION

Earnings Per Share of $1.88 for Fourth Quarter and $7.20 for Full-Year 2018 

Increase of 74 Percent for Full-Year 2018 Compared to 2017

Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Performance Reflects Robust Revenue Growth, Strong Credit Quality, Prudent Expense Control and Active Capital Management

Full-Year 2018 Benefited from Reduction in Tax Rate and Discrete Tax Items

“The fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results demonstrate our ability to carefully manage loan and deposit pricing in a rising-rate environment, produce strong credit quality, successfully execute our GEAR Up initiatives, and meaningfully reduce excess capital. We also benefited from a lower tax rate due to tax reform," said Ralph W. Babb, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "All together, these drove a return on equity of over 16 percent for the fourth quarter. We believe we are well positioned to continue to increase our bottom line as we drive revenue growth and positive operating leverage, while achieving favorable credit metrics. In addition, we expect to maintain our robust returns, while properly managing our capital base to support growth and investment in our businesses. In summary, we remain focused on our relationship banking strategy, which we expect will continue to enhance shareholder value."

Full-Year 2019 Outlook

For full-year 2019 compared to full-year 2018 reported results, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and rate environment:

•Growth in average loans of 2 percent to 4 percent, reflecting increases in most lines of business.

•Decline in average deposits of 1 percent to 2 percent from a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits.

•Growth in net interest income of 4 percent to 5 percent from the full-year net benefit of higher interest rates ($130 million to $150 million), growth in average loans and repositioning the securities portfolio, partially offset by higher average debt and lower interest recoveries.

•Provision for credit losses of 15 basis points to 25 basis points and net charge-offs to remain low.

•Noninterest income higher by 2 percent to 3 percent, benefiting from growth in card fees and fiduciary income, partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts and lower derivative income.

•Noninterest expenses lower by 3 percent, reflecting the end of restructuring charges from the GEAR Up initiatives ($53 million in full-year 2018), FDIC insurance expense lower by $16 million from the discontinuance of the surcharge, lower compensation and pension expense, partially offset by higher outside processing expenses in line with growing revenue, technology expenditures and typical inflationary pressures. 

◦Lower compensation driven by incentive compensation, partially offset by merit increases.

•Income tax expense to be approximately 23 percent of pre-tax income, excluding any tax impact from employee stock transactions.

◦Full-year 2018 included discrete tax benefits of $48 million.

•Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio target of 9.5 percent to 10 percent through continued return of excess capital.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (unaudited)

Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries     

Comerica believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and performance trends. Comerica believes the adjusted financial results provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods. Tangible common equity is used by Comerica to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Securities repositioning refers to losses incurred on the sale of $1.3 billion of treasury securities that were replaced by higher-yielding treasuries with a similar duration of 3 years. Proforma effect of the adoption of accounting standard relates to the proforma 2017 impact of the new revenue recognition standard that became effective January 1, 2018 that is not reflected in 2017 results. Discrete tax items primarily include the charge to adjust deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, tax benefits from the review of tax capitalization and recovery positions on fixed assets and software on the 2017 tax return as well as from employee stock transactions.

The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders equity per share of common stock.
