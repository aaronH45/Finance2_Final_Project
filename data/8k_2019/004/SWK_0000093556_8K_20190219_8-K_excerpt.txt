Item 8.01 Other Events.

On January 25, 2019 IPS Worldwide, LLC (“IPS”), a third-party provider of freight payment processing services for Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. ("the Company"), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and listed the Company as an unsecured creditor. As of December 29, 2018, there were outstanding obligations of approximately $50 million owed to certain of the Company’s freight carriers. Such amounts had previously been remitted to IPS through a third-party financing program for ultimate payment to these freight carriers. However, due to nonperformance of IPS with respect to processing these payments and the Company’s obligation to its freight carriers, an incremental $50 million charge, that will impact the Company’s previously provided 2018 GAAP earnings per share results, will be reflected in the Company’s full year 2018 GAAP consolidated financial statements when filed on Form 10-K later this month. This charge does not include any amounts that the Company will attempt to recover from insurance and/or through the bankruptcy proceedings, which could ultimately reduce the loss exposure recorded.

SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
