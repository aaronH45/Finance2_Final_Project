Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

Issuance of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior notes  

Overview  

On January 30, 2019, HCA Inc. (the “Issuer”), a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of HCA Healthcare, Inc. (the “Parent Guarantor”), completed the public offering of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”), guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Parent Guarantor. The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to the Issuer’s and the Parent Guarantor’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed on August 9, 2018 (File No. 333-226709) (the “Registration Statement”), as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated January 17, 2019, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act.  

On January 30, 2019, the Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of August 1, 2011 (the “Base Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, Delaware Trust Company (as successor to Law Debenture Trust Company of New York), as trustee (the “Trustee”), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as registrar, paying agent and transfer agent (the “Registrar”), as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture No. 22, dated as of January 30, 2019, among the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, the Trustee and the Registrar (together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”).  

The following is a brief description of the terms of the Notes and the Indenture.  

Maturity and Interest Payment Dates  

The Notes will mature on February 1, 2029. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually, on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on August 1, 2019, to holders of record on the preceding January 15 or July 15, as the case may be.  

Ranking  

The Notes are the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and: (i) rank senior in right of payment to any of its existing and future subordinated indebtedness, (ii) rank equally in right of payment with any of its existing and future senior indebtedness, (iii) are effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of its existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and (iv) are structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of its subsidiaries.  

Guarantees  

The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Parent Guarantor.   

Covenants  

The Indenture contains covenants limiting the Issuer’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to: (i) create liens on certain assets to secure debt, (ii) engage in certain sale and lease-back transactions and (iii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.  

Optional Redemption  

The Indenture permits the Issuer to redeem some or all of the Notes at any time at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture.  

Change of Control  

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the Indenture, each holder of the Notes has the right to require the Issuer to repurchase some or all of such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.  

Events of Default  

The Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to become or to be declared due and payable.  

The foregoing descriptions of the Notes and the Indenture (including the form of the Notes) are qualified in their entirety by the terms of such agreements. Please refer to such agreements, which are incorporated herein by reference and attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 through 4.3.
