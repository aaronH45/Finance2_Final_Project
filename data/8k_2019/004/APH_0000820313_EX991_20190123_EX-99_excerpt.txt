 FOURTH QUARTER 2018 RECORD RESULTS  

 REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION  

 Wallingford, Connecticut. January 23, 2019. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE: APH) reported today GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) for the fourth quarter 2018 of $1.09 compared to a GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.34 for the comparable 2017 period. GAAP Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter 2018 includes (i) a benefit of approximately $15 million ($0.04 per share) as a result of the finalization of the provisional income tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) and (ii) an excess tax benefit of approximately $6 million ($0.02 per share) related to stock options exercised, partially offset by (iii) acquisition-related transaction costs of approximately $9.0 million ($0.02 per share). Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP diluted loss per share included (i) an estimated provisional income tax charge of approximately $400 million ($1.26 per share) related to the enactment of the Tax Act and (ii) the dilutive share impact due to the reported net loss for the quarter ($0.01 per share) partially offset by (iii) the excess tax benefit of approximately $21 million ($0.07 per share) related to stock options exercised during the quarter. Excluding the effect of these items, Adjusted Diluted EPS1 for the fourth quarter 2018 was a record $1.05 compared to $0.86 for the fourth quarter of 2017.  

 Sales for the fourth quarter 2018 were a record $2.225 billion compared to $1.944 billion for the comparable 2017 period. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $28 million in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to the 2017 period.   

 For the year ended December 31, 2018, GAAP Diluted EPS was $3.85 compared to $2.06 for the full year 2017. GAAP Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2018, includes (i) the previously mentioned benefit as a result of the finalization of the provisional income tax charge related to the Tax Act and (ii) an excess tax benefit of approximately $20 million ($0.06 per share) related to stock options exercised during such period, partially offset by (iii) the previously mentioned acquisition-related transaction costs. Full year 2017 GAAP Diluted EPS included the Tax Act charge and related dilutive share impact mentioned above, plus a charge for acquisition-related transaction costs of approximately $4 million ($0.01 per share) partially offset by an excess tax benefit of approximately $67 million ($0.21 per share) related to stock options exercised during the period. Excluding the effect of these items, Adjusted Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a record $3.77 compared to $3.12 for the full year 2017.  

 Sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were a record $8.202 billion compared to $7.011 billion for the full year 2017. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $60 million for the full year 2018 compared to 2017.  

 Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated, “We are pleased to have achieved new records in sales, Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Diluted EPS for the full year 2018. These record results were supported by a strong fourth quarter 2018, with sales well above the high end of our guidance due primarily to incremental strength in sales of products into the mobile devices market. Sales in the fourth quarter 2018 increased 14% from prior year, reflecting strong organic growth across most of the Company’s diversified end markets, including mobile devices, military, IT and datacom, mobile networks, commercial air and broadband. For the full year 2018, sales grew by a strong 17% in U.S. dollars, with superior organic growth in nearly every market we serve.”  

 “We are also very proud of the Company’s record levels of profitability in the fourth quarter and full year 2018. Compared to 2017, Adjusted Diluted EPS grew 22% and 21% for the quarter and full year, respectively, and we achieved record adjusted operating margins of 21.0% and 20.7% for those same periods. Operating cash flow in the quarter and full year 2018 was a strong $378 million and $1.113 billion, respectively. The Company’s full year operating cash flow was particularly strong considering the $81 million payment made in the first quarter 2018 to fully fund our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, as well as the Company’s higher than normal tax-related payments during 2018 resulting from the Tax Act. Our strong operating cash flow generation is a clear confirmation of the quality of the Company’s earnings.”  

 “The Company continues to pursue a balanced yet flexible approach to deploying our financial strength in order to increase shareholder value. Consistent with this strategy, in January 2019, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”). Based in Janesville, Wisconsin, SSI is a leading designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensing solutions for the global automotive and industrial markets with annual sales of approximately $180 million. We are excited by the long-term potential that this acquisition creates for Amphenol as we continue to expand the breadth of our sensor offering while also building on our already strong position in the global automotive and industrial markets. Also consistent with our balanced approach to capital deployment, the Company repurchased approximately three million shares during the fourth quarter of 2018, bringing total share repurchases in 2018 to approximately 11 million shares.”  

 “We are pleased by the Company’s excellent performance in 2018, which reflects the benefits of our deep commitment to developing enabling technologies for customers across all of our end markets, our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification, as well as the Company’s successful acquisition program. Most importantly, these results are a clear reflection of the Amphenol team’s outstanding execution in 2018.”  

 “Looking ahead, there is a heightened level of uncertainty in the global economy, in particular related to trade policy. Considering this environment, together with our expectation for a higher than typical seasonal reduction in the mobile devices market related to the incremental sales we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018, and assuming current currency exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2019 sales to be in the range of $1.898 billion to $1.938 billion and Adjusted Diluted EPS in the range of $0.86 to $0.88. For the full year 2019, we expect sales in the range of $8.190 billion to $8.350 billion, flat to an increase of 2% over 2018, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.88 to $3.96, an increase of 3% to 5% over 2018.”  

 “We are encouraged by the platform of strength created by the Company’s strong performance in 2018. The electronics revolution continues to create exciting new growth opportunities for Amphenol across each of our diversified end markets, with customers driving their products and networks to achieve ever higher levels of performance. This continues to create increased demand for our expanded range of high technology interconnect, sensor and antenna products. Our ongoing actions to leverage our competitive advantages and create sustained financial strength, as well as our initiatives to expand our high technology product offerings, both organically and through our successful acquisition program, have created an excellent base for future performance. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding, entrepreneurial management team to dynamically adjust to the always changing environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position.”

existing and future product lines, for continued revenue growth; the Company’s ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, including as a result of significant deterioration of general economic or capital market conditions, or as a result of a downgrade in the Company’s credit rating; changes in exchange rates of the various currencies in which the Company conducts business, including possible currency devaluations; changes in interest rates which could impact existing or future issuances of debt; changes in tax laws, regulations and guidance, including related interpretations, in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, such as the Tax Act; political, economic, military and other risks in countries outside of the United States, including political, economic, financial or other instability, intergovernmental conflicts or actions, strikes or natural disasters; the impact of general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions and U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including those affecting China, on the Company’s business operations; difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses as part of the Company’s growth strategy, including the potential for the impairment of goodwill; the Company’s ability to obtain a consistent supply of materials, at stable pricing levels, used in the Company’s manufacturing processes, including aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, certain rare earth metals and plastic resins; litigation or environmental matters including changes to laws and regulations that the Company may be subject to; and cybersecurity threats or incidents that could arise.

 RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

 (Unaudited)  

 (dollars in millions, except per share data)  

 Management utilizes the non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company's Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and period-over-period comparative results. The following non-GAAP financial measures exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. Items excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the provisional income tax charge recorded in 2017 related to the Tax Act and the subsequent final adjustment recorded in 2018 related to this charge. The following non-GAAP financial information is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  

 The following are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the periods presented:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)    While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure. 

   (2)    For the three months ended December 31, 2017, diluted weighted average shares used to calculate the GAAP diluted net loss per common share excludes the anti-dilutive effect of 12.4 million common share equivalents due to the GAAP net loss position during the period. However, the Adjusted Diluted EPS as well as the diluted EPS impact of each non-GAAP reconciling item during this period was calculated using the diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 317.8 million shares. 

   (3)    The definitions of non-GAAP financial measures used are as follows: 

 Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating Income (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income), excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented.  

 Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).  

 Adjusted Net Income (loss) attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net Income (loss) attributable to Amphenol Corporation (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented.   

 Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) expressed as a percentage of Income before income taxes (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income), each excluding the income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the periods presented.  

 Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings (loss) per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined above, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).
