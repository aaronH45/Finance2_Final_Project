2019 Full-Year Forecast 

Methodology Change

Since becoming a public company in 2008, PMI has expressed its annual reported diluted earnings per share forecast and the related adjusted diluted EPS growth rate as a range. As PMI has previously communicated, its reduced-risk product category performance is expected to play an increasingly important role in the company's future results. However, its growth trajectory is inherently more difficult to predict with the same level of accuracy compared to the performance of its cigarette category. Specifically, the company anticipates periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for reduced-risk products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult to predict compared to those for cigarettes. Therefore, the company believes it is more prudent to now forecast its annual reported diluted earnings per share, and the related currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth rate, by reference to a minimum threshold of expected performance at the start of the year, and provide more details as the year unfolds. 

2019 Full-Year Forecast

Reported diluted earnings per share forecast to be at least $5.37, at prevailing exchange rates, representing a projected increase of at least 5.7% versus reported diluted earnings per share of $5.08 in 2018.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Full-Year Forecast Overview & Assumptions 

This forecast assumes:

•A total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline for PMI of approximately 1.5% to 2.0% versus an estimated total international industry volume decline, excluding China and the U.S., of approximately 2.5% to 3.0%; and

- -2 -

•Currency-neutral net revenue growth of at least 5.0%, which includes an adverse impact of approximately 0.6 points related to the move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina resulting in the treatment of the U.S. dollar as the functional currency of the company’s Argentinian affiliates, described below.

This forecast further assumes:

•An increase in full-year reported operating income margin of at least one percentage point, ex-currency, compared to 2018;

•Operating cash flow of at least $10.0 billion, subject to year-end working capital requirements;

•Capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion;

•An effective tax rate of approximately 23%; and

•No share repurchases.

This forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and any unusual events. Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.

PMI’s 2019-2021 Targets 

The company has communicated the following key targets related to the three-year period 2019 to 2021:

•Net revenue compound annual currency-neutral growth of at least 5%;

•Adjusted diluted EPS compound annual currency-neutral growth of at least 8%; and

•Heated tobacco unit volume of 90-100 billion units by 2021;

2018 FOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

NEW YORK, February 7, 2019 – Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE: PM) today announced its 2018 fourth-quarter and full-year results. 

"We closed out a challenging year with a robust financial and strategic performance across the business. Excluding inventory movements largely associated with heated tobacco unit volume in Japan, our total volume variance was flat -- our best annual performance since 2012 -- underpinned by a near doubling of global in-market sales of heated tobacco units. We grew our international market share by 0.5 points to reach 28.4%, and maintained a stable share of the cigarette category, highlighting our ability to successfully manage our transition to reduced-risk products," said André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer.

"Our total net revenues were driven by an exceptional cigarette pricing variance of 7.6% and a strong contribution of more than $4 billion from our smoke-free products, despite the impact of the inventory adjustments. Our operating income was essentially flat, excluding currency, primarily reflecting increased investment behind our reduced-risk product portfolio. Our robust, currency-neutral double-digit adjusted EPS performance was assisted by a lower effective tax rate and interest expense."

"Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our employees around the world, and significant investments in portfolio development and organizational capabilities, including a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure to fuel our expansion, we believe we have laid the foundation for an even better performance in 2019. The underlying strength of our combustible tobacco business remains intact and our reduced-risk products are the catalysts to accelerate our

business growth and secure the long term future of our company and the sustainability of our earnings and dividend growth."

Tax Items & Impact of U.S. Tax Reform

PMI completed its analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act during 2018 and adjusted the 2017 provisional estimates to the final amounts based on its 2017 U.S. federal income tax return as filed. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter 2018, PMI recorded in its income tax provision a charge of $31 million representing a current income tax charge of $185 million, primarily due to an increase in its aggregate foreign cash position used to determine its final 2017 transition tax liability, mostly offset by a deferred income tax benefit of $154 million primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the state of New York. Updates to the provisional estimates have been recorded in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118").

PMI's 2019 full-year diluted earnings per share forecast assumes a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 23%, reflecting the current analysis, interpretation and clarifications of the scope and impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”).

The Act has significant complexity, and PMI's final full-year effective tax rate may differ from this assumption, due to, among other things, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, related interpretations and clarifications of tax law, in addition to repatriation cost differences and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.

U.S. GAAP Treatment of Argentina as a Highly Inflationary Economy 

Following the categorization of Argentina by the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality as a country with a three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100%, the country is considered highly inflationary in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Consequently, PMI began to account for the operations of its Argentinian affiliates as highly inflationary, and to treat the U.S. dollar as the functional currency of the affiliates, effective July 1, 2018. The move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina reduced PMI's currency-neutral net revenue growth by approximately 0.6 points in 2018.

Dividends 

During 2018, PMI increased its regular quarterly dividend by 6.5%, from $1.07 to $1.14, representing an annualized rate of $4.56 per common share. Since its spin-off in March 2008, PMI has increased its regular quarterly dividend by a compound annual growth rate of 9.5%, or by 147.8% from the initial annualized rate of $1.84 per common share.

“Cost/Other” also includes the currency-neutral net revenue variance, unrelated to volume/mix and price components, attributable to fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets in the ME&A Region. This immaterial presentational change, made in conjunction with the new revenue recognition standard, is prospective only.

Net revenues, excluding unfavorable currency, increased by 3.4%, reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, notably in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine, partly offset by France, Korea, Saudi Arabia and Thailand; as well as a favorable "cost/other" variance as described above.

These favorable variances were partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix, primarily reflecting unfavorable cigarette volume/mix, notably in Australia, the GCC, notably Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and Russia, partly offset by Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey. The unfavorable cigarette volume/mix was partly offset by favorable heated tobacco unit volume in the EU, notably the Czech Republic, Germany and Italy, as well as Korea, PMI Duty Free and Russia, partly offset by unfavorable heated tobacco unit volume in Japan, reflecting the net impact of estimated distributor inventory movements.

Operating income, excluding unfavorable currency, was essentially flat, reflecting: a favorable pricing variance; partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix, due mainly to lower volume in Japan and Saudi Arabia and lower mix in Indonesia and Russia, partly offset by higher volume in the EU, driven by heated tobacco units, as well as Korea, PMI Duty Free, Thailand and Turkey. The favorable pricing variance was also partly offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs, primarily related to increased investment behind reduced-risk products across all Regions, predominantly the EU and EA&A.

Philip Morris International: Building a Smoke-Free Future 

Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI's smoke-free IQOS product portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of December 31, 2018, PMI estimates that approximately 6.6 million adult smokers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to PMI’s heated tobacco product, which is currently available for sale in 44 markets in key cities or nationwide under the IQOS brand.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.

PMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance.

PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.

•Unless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, PMI shipment volume and PMI market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units.

•Key market data regarding total market size, PMI shipments and market share can be found in Appendixes 1 and 2 provided with this press release. 

•References to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares are PMI estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or PMI's duty free business.

•"OTP" is defined as "other tobacco products," primarily roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos, and does not include reduced-risk products.

•"Combustible products" is the term PMI uses to refer to cigarettes and OTP, combined.

•In-market sales, or "IMS," is defined as sales to the retail channel, depending on the market and distribution model. 

•"Total shipment volume" is defined as the combined total of cigarette shipment volume and heated tobacco unit shipment volume.

•Effective January 1, 2018, PMI began managing its business in six reporting segments as follows: the European Union Region (EU); the Eastern Europe Region (EE); the Middle East & Africa Region (ME&A), which includes PMI Duty Free; the South & Southeast Asia Region (S&SA); the East Asia & Australia Region (EA&A); and the Latin America & Canada Region (LA&C). 

•"North Africa" is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.

•"The GCC" (Gulf Cooperation Council) is defined as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

•From time to time, PMI’s shipment volumes are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements, and estimated total industry/market volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of PMI’s competitors arising from market-specific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures. Such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain, shipment methods, consumer demand, timing of excise tax increases or other influences that may affect the timing of sales to customers. In such instances, in addition to reviewing PMI shipment volumes and certain estimated total industry/market volumes on a reported basis, management reviews these measures on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements. Management also believes that disclosing PMI shipment volumes and estimated total industry/market volumes in such circumstances on a basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements improves the comparability of performance and trends for these measures over different reporting periods.

•"OECD" is defined as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Financial

•Net revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods.

•Net revenues related to RRPs represent the sale of heated tobacco units, IQOS devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, primarily e-vapor products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods. 

•PMI has adopted Accounting Standard Update ASU 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" as of January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. PMI made an accounting policy election to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues, net of 

- -27 -

excise taxes in all periods. The underlying principles of the new standard, relating to the measurement of revenue and the timing of recognition, are closely aligned with PMI's current business model and practices. 

•PMI adopted Accounting Standard Update ASU 2017-07 "Compensation - Retirement Benefits" as of January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. Previously, total pension and other employee benefit costs were included in operating income. Beginning January 1, 2018, only the service cost component is required to be shown in operating income, while all other cost components are presented in a new line item “pension and other employee benefit costs" below operating income. 

•Prior to 2018, management evaluated business segment performance, and allocated resources, based on operating companies income, or OCI. Effective January 1, 2018, management began evaluating business segment performance, and allocating resources, based on operating income, or OI. 

•"Cost of sales" consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and handling costs; and the cost of IQOS devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers. Estimated costs associated with IQOS warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.

•"Marketing, administration and research costs" include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses. 

•"Cost/Other" in the Financial Summary table of total PMI and the six reporting segments of this release reflects the currency-neutral variances of: cost of sales (excluding the volume/mix cost component); marketing, administration and research costs; asset impairment and exit costs; and amortization of intangibles. “Cost/Other” also includes the currency-neutral net revenue variance, unrelated to volume/mix and price components, attributable to fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets in the ME&A Region.

•"Adjusted Operating Income Margin" is calculated as adjusted operating income, divided by net revenues.

•"Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, excluding asset impairment and exit costs, and unusual items.

•"Net debt" is defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents.

•Management reviews net revenues, OI, OI margins, operating cash flow and earnings per share, or "EPS," on an adjusted basis, which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, tax items and other special items. 

•Management reviews these measures because they exclude changes in currency exchange rates and other factors that may distort underlying business trends, thereby improving the comparability of PMI’s business performance between reporting periods. Furthermore, PMI uses several of these measures in its management compensation program to promote internal fairness and a disciplined assessment of performance against company targets. PMI discloses these measures to enable investors to view the business through the eyes of management. 

•Non-GAAP measures used in this release should neither be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see the relevant schedules provided with this press release. 

Reduced-Risk Products

•"Reduced-risk products," or "RRPs," is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Because PMI's RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.

•The IQOS heat-not-burn device is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]
