Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In this preliminary earnings release, the company supplements its reporting of information determined in accordance with GAAP, such as revenue, income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations, with “adjusted revenue,” “internal revenue growth,” “adjusted net income,” “adjusted earnings per share” and “adjusted earnings per share, as adjusted for the Lending Transaction.” Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses should enhance shareholders’ ability to  

2   

Press Release  

 evaluate the company’s performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Therefore, the company excludes these items from GAAP revenue, income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations to calculate these non-GAAP measures. The corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this preliminary earnings release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the non-cash and other items described below that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures. See page 9 for additional information regarding the company’s forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.  

Examples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, severance costs, charges associated with early debt extinguishment, merger and integration costs, certain costs associated with the achievement of the company’s operational effectiveness objectives, gains or losses from dispositions and unconsolidated affiliates, and certain discrete tax benefits and expenses. The company excludes these items to more clearly focus on the factors management believes are pertinent to its operations, and management uses this information to make operating decisions, including the allocation of resources to the company’s various businesses.  

Internal revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and is described on page 8. Management believes internal revenue growth is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of postage reimbursements in the company’s Output Solutions business, and including deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. Management believes this supplemental information enhances shareholders’ ability to evaluate and understand the company’s core business performance.  

These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

The preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 represent the most current information available to management and reflect estimates and assumptions. The company’s actual results may differ materially from these preliminary results due to the completion of the company’s financial closing procedures, final adjustments and other developments that may arise between the date of this press release and the time that financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 are finalized.

Fiserv, Inc.  

Full Year Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Internal Revenue Growth—The company’s internal revenue growth outlook for 2019 excludes acquisitions, dispositions, and the impact of postage reimbursements in its Output Solutions business, and includes deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. These adjustments are subject to variability and are anticipated to increase 2019 GAAP revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point as compared to the internal revenue growth rate.  

Adjusted Earnings Per Share—The company’s adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2019 excludes certain non-cash or other items which should enhance shareholders’ ability to evaluate the company’s performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Non-cash or other items may be significant and include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, severance costs, charges associated with early debt extinguishment, merger and integration costs, certain costs associated with the achievement of the company’s operational effectiveness objectives, gains or losses from dispositions and unconsolidated affiliates, and certain discrete tax benefits and expenses. The company estimates that the amortization expense with respect to acquired intangible assets as of December 31, 2018 will be approximately $180 million in 2019. Other adjustments to earnings per share that have been incurred in 2018 are presented on page 6. Estimates of these other adjustments on a forward-looking basis are not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of these items.  

The company’s adjusted earnings per share growth outlook for 2019 reflects 2018 performance as adjusted for the Lending Transaction.
