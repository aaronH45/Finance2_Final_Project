Management Commentary

William J. Stromberg, president and chief executive officer, commented: "Overall it was a strong financial year for the firm, with average AUM, revenues, and earnings per share up markedly over 2017. We continued to perform well for our clients, with favorable long-term investment performance versus our peers and high client satisfaction across our channels. Our strong financial position has enabled continued strategic investments in our capabilities. We also returned nearly 100% of 2018 net income to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. For the year we reported organic AUM growth of 1.3%, driven by diversified inflows across distribution channels and geographies, the strength of our multi-asset franchise, and positive flows into international equity and fixed income.

“For the fourth quarter, increases in average AUM, revenues, and earnings per share were more muted, as steep equity declines drove our AUM lower, particularly in December. Amidst the increased market volatility, we were pleased with our relative investment performance versus our peers and continued strong gross sales momentum in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, we realized net outflows due to elevated market volatility-driven redemptions, similar to broad industry net cash flow trends.

“Our teams remain highly focused on executing on our strategic plan, enhancing our capabilities, and gaining operational efficiencies. Highlights of recent efforts to broaden our product offerings and advance other initiatives include:

▪Investment Capabilities - Our global investment professional staff increased nearly 7% in 2018 to more than 600, including growth of our multi-asset solutions team and the hiring of additional investment, credit, and specialty analysts. We recently introduced the Dynamic Credit Fund and other new strategies are planned for launch later in 2019.

▪Americas Distribution - A second straight year of 20% growth in the number of client-facing associates in our U.S. intermediaries channel supported an expansion of regional coverage and increasing flows with broker-dealers. We also continued to gain traction with recordkeeping small-market retirement plans. 

▪EMEA and APAC Distribution - During the fourth quarter we launched our first locally domiciled Japan Investment Trust and added new sub-funds and share classes to our Australian Unit Trust and SICAV lineups, with more planned. We also hired a head of institutional business for Germany and Austria.

“Though broad fourth quarter market declines will impact our near-term financial results, we plan to continue with our highest priority strategic initiatives while carefully managing discretionary expenses. Our client value proposition remains strong and over time we expect that our people, process, and culture will enable us to strengthen our active management leadership, weather industry pressures, and deliver value to our clients and stockholders.”

Assets Under Management

Assets under management decreased $121.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $962.3 billion at December 31, 2018. The firm's net cash outflows were $8.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. Clients transferred $3.7 billion in net assets from the U.S. mutual funds to other investment products, including the Retirement Date Trusts, in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The assets under management in the firm's target date retirement products, which are reported as part of the multi-asset column in the table above, were $230.4 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $252.1 billion at September 30, 2018, and $233.8 billion at December 31, 2017. Net cash flows into these portfolios were $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $12.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Investors domiciled outside the United States accounted for about 6% of the firm's assets under management at both December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Financial Results

Net Revenues earned in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $1.3 billion, up 0.6% from the comparable 2017 quarter.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating expenses were $762.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with $766.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the year, operating expenses were $3.0 billion in 2018 compared with $2.7 billion in 2017. The increase in operating expenses for 2018 was primarily due to continued strategic investments and higher bonus and stock-based compensation, which were driven by the firm's operating results. Following a final, non-appealable judgment issued in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to the Dell appraisal rights matter, the firm recognized a reduction in operating expenses in the quarter of $15.2 million to account for repayments from clients. In 2017, operating expenses were reduced by $50.0 million in insurance recoveries related to the matter.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

$794.7 million compared with the 2017 quarter and for the year increased 8.9% to $3.0 billion. The firm currently expects its 2019 non-GAAP operating expense growth to be in the range of 4% to 7%. This expense growth range factors in continued investments in the business, the firm's cost optimization efforts, and the incremental cost of paying for all third-party investment research as and when implemented. The firm could elect to adjust its expense growth should unforeseen circumstances arise, including significant market movements.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-operating losses were $151.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, as sharp equity market declines led to losses in our investment portfolio compared with net gains of $102.0 million recognized in the comparable 2017 quarter. The firm's consolidated investment products were the primary contributor to the net losses recognized during the fourth quarter of 2018, while the firm's cash and discretionary investments experienced gains. The components of non-operating income (loss) for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2018 and 2017 are included in the tables at the end of this release.

Income Taxes. The firm's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 of 30.3% contributes to an effective tax rate for year ended December 31, 2018 of 25.8%, compared with 36.9% for 2017 as U.S. tax reform reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% on January 1, 2018. The firm's higher effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared with the full year 2018 is driven primarily by net losses attributable to non-controlling interests as the firm does not recognize any tax impact associated with these losses. The following reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to the firm's effective tax rate for full year 2018:

The firm estimates its effective tax rate for the full year 2019 will be in the range of 23.5% to 26.5%.

Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation

The firm believes the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about its core operating results. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating the firm's core business, for comparing current results with prior period results, and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers. However, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. The following schedule reconciles U.S. GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the full year 2018 and 2017. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The non-GAAP adjustments add back the management and administrative fees that the firm earns from the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products and subtract the investment income and operating expenses of these products that have been included in the firm's U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. Management believes the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products may impact the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results. The following table details the calculation of operating expenses of consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products, net of elimination of its related management and administrative fees.

The following table details the calculation of net income of consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products, net of redeemable non-controlling interests: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact of market movements on the supplemental savings plan liability and related economic hedges of the liability beginning July 1, 2017. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by the employees. Since the firm economically hedges the exposure to these market movements, management believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income earned on the hedges against the related compensation expense to increase comparability period to period. The following table details the supplemental savings plan related items:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(3) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the non-operating income that remains after backing out the portion related to the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products and the investments designated as an economic hedge of our supplemental savings plan liability. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, management modified the non-GAAP adjustment to no longer adjust for the investment gains recognized on its cash and discretionary investments, as the income earned on these assets are considered part of the firm's core operations. The impact on previously reported non-GAAP measures is immaterial. Management believes adjusting for the remaining non-operating income helps the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, management does not emphasize the impact of the portion of non-operating income removed when managing and evaluating the firm's performance. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(4) In 2017, the firm recognized insurance recoveries of $50.0 million related to the Dell appraisal rights matter as a reduction in operating expenses. During 2018 the firm recognized an additional reduction in operating expenses of $15.2 million upon recovering a portion of the payments made to the firm's clients in 2016. Management believes it is useful to readers of the firm's consolidated statements of income to adjust for these items given the nonrecurring nature of the initial charge and related recoveries.

(5) The income tax impacts were calculated in order to achieve an overall year-to-date non-GAAP effective tax rate of 24.1% for 2018 and 34.7% for 2017. As such, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.4% for 2018 and 29.0% for 2017. The firm estimates its effective tax rate for the full-year 2019 on a non-GAAP basis will be in the range of 24% to 26%. 

(6) In the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm recognized a nonrecurring charge of $71.1 million to reflect the effect of the U.S. tax law changes enacted on December 22, 2017. During the second quarter of 2018, the firm recognized a nonrecurring charge of $20.8 million for an adjustment made to the charge taken in 2017 related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Management believes it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.

(7) During the second quarter of 2018 the firm recognized a nonrecurring charge of $7.9 million for the remeasurement of the firm's deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effect of Maryland state tax legislation enacted on April 24, 2018. Management believes it is useful to readers of the firm's consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.

(8) This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution.
