2 The company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures at the end of the release. The company has determined this measure is more representative of underlying operating revenues growth for PGI as it removes commissions that are collected through fee revenue and passed through expenses with no impact to pre-tax operating earnings.

Segment Results

Retirement and Income Solutions - Fee

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Pre-tax operating earnings decreased $34.6 million as unfavorable equity market performance caused a decline in fees and other revenues as well as higher deferred acquisition cost (DAC) amortization expense. 

•Net revenue decreased $25.9 million primarily due to lower fees and other revenues as a result of equity market declines. 

Retirement and Income Solutions - Spread

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Pre-tax operating earnings increased $4.2 million primarily due to higher net revenue from growth in the business. 

•Net revenue increased $12.5 million primarily from growth in the business.

3 Pre-tax operating earnings = operating earnings before income taxes and after noncontrolling interest.

4 Net revenue = operating revenues less benefits, claims and settlement expenses less dividends to policyholders.

5 Pre-tax return on net revenue = pre-tax operating earnings divided by net revenue.

Principal Global Investors

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Pre-tax operating earnings decreased $23.6 million primarily due to lower operating revenues less pass-through commissions and additional expenses, primarily severance related. Record full year pre-tax operating earnings increased $83.5 million predominately due to an accelerated performance fee in third quarter. 

•Operating revenues less pass-through commissions decreased $18.4 million as a result of lower management fees due to a decline in assets under management from unfavorable market performance and negative net cash flow. 

Principal International

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Pre-tax operating earnings decreased $24.1 million as growth in the business was more than offset by unfavorable encaje performance and foreign currency translation as well as lower than expected inflation in Brazil.

6 Pre-tax return on operating revenues less pass-through commissions = pre-tax operating earnings, adjusted for noncontrolling interest divided by operating revenues less pass-through commissions.

7 Combined net revenue: net revenue for all PI companies at 100% less pass-through commissions. Prior to 1Q 2018, pass-through commissions were not excluded from this definition. The company has determined combined net revenue (at PFG share) is more representative of underlying net revenue growth for PI as it reflects our proportionate share of consolidated and equity method subsidiaries. In addition, using this net revenue metric provides a more meaningful representation of our profit margins.

Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause or contribute to such material differences are discussed in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, and in the company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2018, filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as updated or supplemented from time to time in subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect the company’s ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital; conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally; volatility or declines in the equity, bond or real estate markets; changes in interest rates or credit spreads or a sustained low interest rate environment; the company’s investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of its invested assets and the investment returns credited to customers; the company’s valuation of investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on such investments may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations; any impairments of or valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets; the company’s actual experience could differ significantly from its pricing and reserving assumptions; the pattern of amortizing the company’s DAC and other actuarial balances on its universal life-type insurance contracts, participating life insurance policies and certain investment contracts may change; changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards; the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims; the company’s ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet its obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life; litigation and regulatory investigations; from time to time the company may become subject to tax audits, tax litigation or similar proceedings, and as a result it may owe additional taxes, interest and penalties in amounts that may be material; applicable laws and the company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider in their best interests; competition, including from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance; technological and societal changes may disrupt the company’s business model and impair its ability to maintain profitability; a downgrade in the company’s financial strength or credit ratings; client terminations, withdrawals or changes in investor preferences; inability to attract and retain qualified employees and sales representatives and develop new distribution sources; an interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other systems, or a failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data residing on such systems; international business risks; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; risks arising from participation in joint ventures; the company may need to fund deficiencies in its “Closed Block” assets; the company’s reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates; risks arising from acquisitions of businesses; and loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect information of our customers or employees. 

Use of Non-GAAP financial measures

The company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company’s financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the 

end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.

Summary of Principal Financial Group, Inc. and Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*U.S. GAAP (GAAP) net income attributable to PFG versus non-GAAP operating earnings

Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings, which is a financial measure that excludes the effect of net realized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments the company believes are not indicative of overall operating trends, for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts. Note: it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of non-GAAP operating earnings enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the company’s businesses.
