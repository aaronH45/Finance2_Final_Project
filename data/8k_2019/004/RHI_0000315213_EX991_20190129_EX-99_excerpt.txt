ROBERT HALF REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND YEAR-END FINANCIAL RESULTS

MENLO PARK, Calif., January 29, 2019 — Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE symbol: RHI) today reported revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018. 

For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, net income was $114 million, or $.95 per share, on revenues of $1.48 billion. Net income for the prior year’s fourth quarter was $47 million, or $.38 per share, on revenues of $1.35 billion.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $434 million, or $3.57 per share, on revenues of $5.80 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $291 million, or $2.33 per share, on revenues of $5.27 billion.

Included in the results for the years ended December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, were charges to the company’s provision for income taxes of $5 million, or $.04 per share, and $34 million, or $.27 per share, respectively, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The charges in 2018 resulted from additional guidance related to the TCJA released in 2018 and the true-up of the estimate originally booked in the fourth quarter of 2017. The charges in 2017 resulted from the impact of the revaluation of the company's deferred income tax net assets. Excluding these charges, the full-year 2018 net income was $439 million, or $3.61 per share, and full-year 2017 net income was $324 million, or $2.60 per share.

Harold M. Messmer, Jr., chairman and CEO of Robert Half, commented: “We ended the year strongly, with double-digit year-over-year growth in revenues and operating income on both a quarterly and annual basis. Full-year 2018 revenues and operating income reached all-time-high levels for the company, with broad-based strength in our staffing and Protiviti operations.” 

Messmer added, “The U.S. labor market remains very robust, with significant demand due to talent shortages across our professional disciplines. 

“During the fourth quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42 percent,” he said.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The financial results of Robert Half International Inc. (the “Company”) are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). To help readers understand the Company’s financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with revenue growth rates derived from non-GAAP revenue amounts.

Variations in the Company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, billing days, and certain intercompany adjustments. The Company provides “as adjusted” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items. These calculations show the year-over-year revenue growth rates for the Company’s lines of business on both a reported basis and also on an as adjusted basis for global, U.S., and international operations. This information is presented for each of the six most recent quarters. The Company has provided this data because management believes it better reflects the Company’s actual revenue growth rates and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The Company expresses year-over-year revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days, constant currency exchange rates, and certain intercompany adjustments.

Additionally, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the Company is including non-GAAP financial results for net income and diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP results reflect the charges to the Company’s provision for income taxes resulting from additional guidance related to the TCJA released in 2018, the true-up in 2018 of the estimated TCJA impact on deferred tax net assets originally booked in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the impact of the one-time, non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The Company has provided this data because management believes that it better reflects the Company’s actual fourth-quarter and year-end financial results.

The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided on the following pages.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

REVENUE GROWTH RATES (%) (UNAUDITED):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The non-GAAP financial measures included in the table above adjust for the following items:

Foreign Currency Translation. The “As Reported” revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues, which include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to calculate “Constant Currency” revenue growth rates, as-reported amounts are retranslated using foreign exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period.

Billing Days. The “As Reported” revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues. Management calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon inputs from all countries and all lines of business. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days, the company calculates “same billing day” revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a “per billing day” amount. The “same billing day” growth rates are then calculated based upon the “per billing day” amounts.

Intercompany Adjustments. The “As Reported” revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by the impact of certain intercompany adjustments, applicable comparative period revenues are reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.

The term “As Adjusted” means that the impact of different billing days, constant currency fluctuations, and certain intercompany adjustments are removed from the revenue growth rate calculation. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP year-over-year revenue growth rates to the “As Reported” year-over-year revenue growth rates is included herein on Pages 8-10.
