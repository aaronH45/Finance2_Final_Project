Other Events  

On January 15, 2019, Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), issued a press release announcing that Fox Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“FOX”), priced a private offering (the “Notes Offering”) of (i) $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.666% Senior Notes due 2022, (ii) $1,250 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.030% Senior Notes due 2024, (iii) $2,000 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.709% Senior Notes due 2029, (iv) $1,250 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.476% Senior Notes due 2039, and (v) $1,550 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.576% Senior Notes due 2049 (collectively, the “Senior Notes”). FOX intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes, together with available cash on its balance sheet and borrowings under the revolving credit facility that FOX expects to enter into, if needed, principally to fund a cash dividend in the amount of $8.5 billion in immediately available funds to the Company immediately prior to the consummation of the distribution of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of FOX to stockholders of the Company (other than holders of the shares held by subsidiaries of the Company) on a pro rata basis (the “distribution”), and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Notes Offering and the other transactions contemplated therein.  

The Company will fully and unconditionally guarantee the Senior Notes on a senior unsecured basis. Upon the consummation of the distribution, the Company’s guarantee will be automatically released, and thereafter, the Senior Notes will solely be the obligations of FOX.  

A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
