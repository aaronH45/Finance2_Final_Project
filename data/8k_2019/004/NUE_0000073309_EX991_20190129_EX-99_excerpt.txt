"Over the past decade, we have been positioning Nucor to take full advantage of an upturn in the steel market. During that time, we invested more than $9 billion to increase the Company's peak earnings power.

The increases from the third quarter of 2018 and fourth quarter of 2017 were mainly due to higher natural gas unit costs.

Recent Developments 

In November 2018, Nucor's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share payable on February 11, 2019 to stockholders of record on December 31, 2018. This dividend is Nucor's 183rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend, and it marks 46 consecutive years of an increased base dividend. Over the past ten years, Nucor has returned more than $5 billion in capital to its stockholders in the form of base dividends, supplemental dividends and share repurchases.

In January 2019, Nucor announced that it will build a state-of-the-art plate mill in the U.S. Midwest. Nucor's board of directors approved an investment of $1.35 billion to build the mill, which is expected to be fully operational in 2022 and will be capable of producing approximately 1.2 million tons per year of steel plate products. This advanced mill will provide us enhanced ability to serve customers in the region, which is the largest plate-consuming area in the U.S., and to meet all the steel needs of customers around the country. The site for the new mill is anticipated to be selected early this year. 

Fourth Quarter Analysis 

As expected, the fourth quarter of 2018 was another strong quarter for Nucor. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018 declined from the third quarter of 2018 due in part to typical seasonality. The profitability of the steel mills segment decreased from the third quarter of 2018 due to lower shipments across the segment and lower average selling prices at our sheet, bar and structural mills. The performance of our steel products segment decreased from the third quarter of 2018 due to some decline in our tubular products group, which experienced a strong third quarter, and our rebar fabrication businesses. The raw materials segment's performance decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the third quarter of 2018 due to decreased earnings of our DRI businesses. 

Outlook 

Following 2018's record-setting earnings performance, we believe that 2019 will be another strong year as we expect the earnings performance to be one of the best in Nucor's history. As we enter 2019, we have a positive outlook on end-use demand and general economic conditions.

We expect another strong quarter for earnings in the first quarter of 2019. Although sheet pricing and margins are expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, this will be partially offset by expected increases in profitability of our bar mills and structural mills. The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the decreased performance of our DRI businesses, which continue to be negatively impacted by declining average selling prices for raw materials that began in the fourth quarter of 2018. The profitability of our steel products segment in the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect first quarter of 2019 earnings to be much stronger than the first quarter of 2018.
