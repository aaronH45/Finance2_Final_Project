(1) Amounts excluding adjusting items are non-GAAP measures that we believe help investors and users of our financial information understand the effect of adjusting items on our selected reported results and provide alternate measurements of our performance, both in the current period and across periods. Growth in earnings per share, excluding adjusting items provides useful information to users of our financial information largely due to the impacts of the Tax Act on full year 2017 results.
