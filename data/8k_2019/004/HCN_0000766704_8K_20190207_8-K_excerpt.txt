Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On February 7, 2019, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Welltower Inc. (the “Company”) increased the size of the Board from twelve to thirteen members and elected Kathryn Sullivan to the Board. Additionally, on February 7, 2019, Geoffrey G. Meyers and Judith C. Pelham informed the Board of their decisions not to stand for reelection to the Board at the Company’s next annual meeting. Mr. Meyers and Ms. Pelham will continue to serve as directors until the annual meeting, at which point the Board will be reduced in size to eleven members.  

Ms. Sullivan will be compensated for her service as director on the same basis as other non-employee directors of the Company. Compensation for the Company’s non-employee directors is described in the Company’s Proxy Statement for its 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2018 (the “Proxy Statement”). On November 30, 2018 the Board approved increases from the compensation amounts disclosed in the Proxy Statement of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively, in the non-employee director annual cash fee and grant of deferred stock units pursuant to the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  

In connection with her appointment, the Company will enter into an indemnification agreement with Ms. Sullivan. The agreement will be substantially identical to the agreements previously entered into between the Company and its other directors and will generally provide that the Company will, in certain circumstances, indemnify Ms. Sullivan against any and all expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement arising out of her service to the Company. Also, the agreement will provide for the advancement of expenses in connection with a threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding.
