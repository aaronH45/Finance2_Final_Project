STATE STREET REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER 2018 EPS OF $1.04; EPS $1.68 

 EXCLUDING NOTABLE ITEMS(a) 

 NET INTEREST INCOME UP 13% WITH NIM EXPANSION YEAR-ON-YEAR 

INITIATED NEW $350 MILLION EXPENSE SAVINGS PROGRAM

BETTER POSITIONED FOR CCAR 2019 DUE TO BALANCE SHEET OPTIMIZATION

FULL-YEAR 2018 ROE OF 12.2%, UP 1.6% POINTS FROM FULL-YEAR 2017

Boston, MA ...January 18, 2019 

In announcing today's financial results, Ronald O'Hanley, President and Chief Executive Officer, said "Over the course of 2018, I have engaged with State Street’s stakeholders including our investors, clients, employees and regulators. I have also led a reexamination of our Investment Servicing and Investment Management strategies. State Street has strong client relationships, unique assets and is well-positioned in attractive, high-growth markets. While we have made progress on our technology transformation, much remains to be done and we are not satisfied with our recent performance. Structural costs are still too high and our automation efforts have not moved fast enough." 

O'Hanley continued, "New business wins remained strong, with a record $1.9 trillion of new asset servicing commitments in 2018, including $140 billion of new mandates in the fourth quarter. Net interest income increased significantly and foreign exchange trading performed well, while weaker equity markets and challenging industry conditions drove underperformance in servicing fees. Amidst challenging market and industry headwinds, we have launched a new expense program designed to reduce costs. As part of that program, we recorded a $223 million pre-tax repositioning charge, the benefits of which we expect to fully realize within 12-15 months. Our newly acquired Charles River Development business performed consistent with our expectations. Charles River Development is driving new activity with existing and new clients and we are making progress towards creating the industry's first fully integrated front-to-back offering." 

 (a)Results excluding notable items are a non-GAAP presentation. Please refer to the addendum for an explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.

O'Hanley concluded, "The changes we are making will position us well to realize our three-year strategic vision to be the leading asset servicer, asset manager, and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital, which I outlined last month. We have already initiated a series of actions and as a result we are highly focused on increasing capital return, revenue growth and margin expansion. I am confident that our strategy represents a significant opportunity to deliver growth, drive innovation and enhance shareholder value."

Financial Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Effects of the new revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014-09): The newly effective revenue recognition standard increased 4Q18 total fee revenue and total expenses by $67 million each relative to 4Q17. In 4Q18 relative to 4Q17, the revenue impact was $50 million in management fees, $11 million in trading services revenue, and $6 million in other line items. The expense impact was $11 million in transaction processing, $48 million in other expenses, and $8 million across other expense line items.

(2) The financial ratio represents the rate of growth of total revenue (or fee revenue) less the rate of growth of expenses relative to the preceding or prior year period, as applicable.

(3) Return on tangible common equity is calculated by dividing year-to-date annualized net income available to common shareholders (GAAP-basis) by tangible common equity. For additional information on the Reconciliation of Tangible Common Equity Ratio refer to the addendum included with this News Release.

Revenue

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The newly effective revenue recognition standard increased 4Q18 total fee revenue by $67 million relative to 4Q17. For 4Q18 relative to 4Q17, the fee revenue impact was $50 million in management fees, $11 million in trading services revenue, and $6 million in other line items. 

nm Not meaningful

Servicing fees decreased from 4Q17, reflecting weaker equity markets and challenging industry conditions, a previously announced client transition, and the unfavorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by new business wins. Compared to 3Q18, servicing fees decreased, primarily due to lower equity market levels and challenging industry conditions, as well as the unfavorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by higher client activity. 

Management fees increased from 4Q17, due to $50 million related to the new revenue recognition standard, partially offset by lower equity market levels. Management fees decreased from 3Q18, primarily due to lower equity market levels and net outflows.

FX Trading Services revenue(2) increased from 4Q17, reflecting higher FX client volumes and volatility. The new revenue recognition standard contributed $11 million to 4Q18 trading services relative to 4Q17. Compared to 3Q18, trading services revenue increased, reflecting higher FX volatility.

6

Securities finance revenue decreased from 4Q17, reflecting balance sheet optimization efforts. Compared to 3Q18, securities finance revenue decreased due to lower assets on loan and lower spreads. 

Processing fees and other revenue increased from 4Q17 and 3Q18. The increase over both periods is primarily due to the contribution of the recently acquired CRD.

Net interest income increased from 4Q17, driven by higher market interest rates in the U.S. and disciplined liability pricing, partially offset by a mix shift to HQLA. Compared to 3Q18, net interest income increased primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates and disciplined liability pricing. Net interest margin on a fully taxable-equivalent basis increased 17 and 7 basis points, respectively, compared to 4Q17 and 3Q18, driven by higher U.S. interest rates, disciplined liability pricing and a smaller interest earning balance sheet. 

(2) FX trading services includes brokerage and other.

Expenses 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The newly effective revenue recognition standard increased 4Q18 total expenses by $67 million relative to 4Q17. For 4Q18 relative to 4Q17, the expense impact was $11 million in transaction processing, $48 million in other expenses, and $8 million across other expense line items.

nm Not meaningful

Compensation and employee benefits expenses increased from 4Q17, primarily reflecting a repositioning charge of $198 million, CRD related compensation and employee benefit expenses of $28 million, higher investments to support new business and annual merit increases, partially offset by net Beacon savings and lower performance based incentive compensation. Compared to 3Q18, compensation and employee benefits expenses increased primarily due to the repositioning charge, the contribution from CRD, and one additional payroll day in 4Q18, partially offset by net Beacon savings and lower performance based incentive compensation. 

Information systems and communications expenses increased from 4Q17 and 3Q18. The increase from both periods reflects technology infrastructure enhancements. 

Transaction processing services expenses decreased from both 4Q17 and 3Q18, reflecting lower market data and sub-custody costs. The 4Q18 transaction processing services expenses includes $11 million related to the new revenue recognition standard.

Occupancy expenses increased from 4Q17, primarily due to $25 million related to the 4Q18 repositioning charge. Compared to 3Q18, occupancy expenses increased, primarily due to the 4Q18 repositioning charge and the optimization of our global footprint strategy. 

Other expenses and intangible asset amortization increased from 4Q17, primarily due to $48 million related to the new revenue recognition standard, higher legal and related expenses of $42 million, CRD related intangible asset amortization of $18 million, and business exit costs. Compared to 3Q18, other expenses increased primarily due to higher legal and related expenses, higher professional fees, CRD related intangible asset amortization, and business exit costs.

The 4Q18 effective tax rate was 12.7% compared to 48.4% in 4Q17 and 11.8% in 3Q18. The 4Q18 tax rate includes the impact of the notable adjustments referenced earlier in this announcement. The 4Q17 tax rate included a one-time estimated net tax cost of $270 million as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), while the 3Q18 tax rate included a reduction related to the 2017 tax legislation changes. 

Capital

The following table presents regulatory capital ratios for State Street Corporation. The lower of capital ratios calculated under the Basel III advanced approaches and under the Basel III standardized approach are applied in the assessment of our capital adequacy for regulatory purposes. Lower quarter-end capital ratios versus 3Q18 reflect the closing of the Charles River Development acquisition on October 1, 2018, partially offset by lower balance sheet levels and a reduction of risk weighted assets.

Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by such forward-looking terminology as “outlook,” “expect,” "priority," “objective,” “intend,” “plan,” “forecast,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,” “may,” “will,” “trend,” “target,” “strategy” and “goal,” or similar statements or variations of such terms. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, are based on current assumptions that are difficult to predict and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements, and those statements should not be relied upon as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to January 18, 2019.

Important factors that may affect future results and outcomes include, but are not limited to:

•the financial strength of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposures or to which our clients have such exposures as a result of our acting as agent for our clients, including as asset manager; 

•increases in the volatility of, or declines in the level of, our NII, changes in the composition or valuation of the assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition (and our ability to measure the fair value of investment securities) and changes in the manner in which we fund those assets;

•the liquidity of the U.S. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities and inter-bank credits; the liquidity of the assets on our balance sheet and changes or volatility in the sources of such funding, particularly the deposits of our clients; and demands upon our liquidity, including the liquidity demands and requirements of our clients; 

•the level and volatility of interest rates, the valuation of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we record revenue or accrue expenses and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the U.S. and internationally; and the impact of monetary and fiscal policy in the U.S. and internationally on prevailing rates of interest and currency exchange rates in the markets in which we provide services to our clients; 

•the credit quality, credit-agency ratings and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of such securities and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income; 

•our ability to attract deposits and other low-cost, short-term funding; our ability to manage the level and pricing of such deposits and the relative portion of our deposits that are determined to be operational under regulatory guidelines; and our ability to deploy deposits in a profitable manner consistent with our liquidity needs, regulatory requirements and risk profile; 

•the manner and timing with which the Federal Reserve and other U.S. and foreign regulators implement or reevaluate the regulatory framework applicable to our operations (as well as changes to that framework), including implementation or modification of the Dodd-Frank Act and related stress testing and resolution planning requirements, implementation of international standards applicable to financial institutions, such as those proposed by the Basel Committee and European legislation (such as UCITS, the Money Market Fund Regulation and MiFID II / MiFIR); among other consequences, these regulatory changes impact the levels of regulatory capital, long term debt and liquidity we must maintain, acceptable levels of credit exposure to third parties, margin requirements applicable to derivatives, restrictions on banking and financial activities and the manner in which we structure and implement our global operations and servicing relationships. In addition, our regulatory posture and related expenses have been and will continue to be affected by heightened standards and changes in regulatory expectations for global systemically important financial institutions applicable to, among other things, risk management, liquidity and capital planning, resolution planning, compliance programs, and changes in governmental enforcement approaches to perceived failures to comply with regulatory or legal obligations;

•adverse changes in the regulatory ratios that we are, or will be, required to meet, whether arising under the Dodd-Frank Act or implementation of international standards applicable to financial institutions, such as those proposed by the Basel Committee, or due to changes in regulatory positions, practices or regulations in jurisdictions in which we engage in banking activities, including changes in internal or external data, formulae, models, assumptions or other advanced systems used in the calculation of our capital or liquidity ratios that cause changes in those ratios as they are measured from period to period; 

•requirements or expectations to obtain the prior approval or non-objection of the Federal Reserve or other U.S. and non-U.S. regulators for the use, allocation or distribution of our capital or other specific capital actions or corporate activities, including, without limitation, acquisitions, investments in subsidiaries, dividends and stock purchases, without which our growth plans, distributions to shareholders, share repurchase programs or other capital or corporate initiatives may be restricted; 

•changes in law or regulation, or the enforcement of law or regulation, that may adversely affect our business activities or those of our clients or our counterparties, and the products or services that we sell, including additional or increased taxes 

10

or assessments thereon, capital adequacy requirements, margin requirements, and changes that expose us to risks related to the adequacy of our controls or compliance programs; 

•economic or financial market disruptions in the U.S. or internationally, including those which may result from recessions or political instability; for example, the U.K.'s decision to exit from the European Union or actual or potential changes in trade policy, such as tariffs or bi-lateral and multi-lateral trade agreements proposed by the U.S.;

•our ability to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients, any failure of which, in whole or in part, may among other things, reduce our competitive position, diminish the cost-effectiveness of our systems and processes or provide an insufficient return on our associated investment; 

•our ability to promote a strong culture of risk management, operating controls, compliance oversight, ethical behavior and governance that meets our expectations and those of our clients and our regulators, and the financial, regulatory, reputation and other consequences of our failure to meet such expectations; 

•the impact on our compliance and controls enhancement programs associated with the appointment of a monitor under the deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and compliance consultant appointed under a settlement with the SEC, including the potential for such monitor and compliance consultant to require changes to our programs or to identify other issues that require substantial expenditures, changes in our operations, payments to clients or reporting to U.S. authorities; 

•the results of our review of our billing practices, including additional findings or amounts we may be required to reimburse clients, as well as potential consequences of such review, including damage to our client relationships or our reputation and adverse actions by governmental authorities; 

•the results of, and costs associated with, governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, litigation and similar claims, disputes, or civil or criminal proceedings; 

•changes or potential changes in the amount of compensation we receive from clients for our services, and the mix of services provided by us that clients choose; 

•the large institutional clients on which we focus are often able to exert considerable market influence and have diverse investment activities, and this, combined with strong competitive market forces, subjects us to significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge, to potentially significant changes in our AUCA or our AUM in the event of the acquisition or loss of a client, in whole or in part, and to potentially significant changes in our fee revenue in the event a client re-balances or changes its investment approach or otherwise re-directs assets to lower- or higher-fee asset classes; 

•the potential for losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds; 

•the possibility that our clients will incur substantial losses in investment pools for which we act as agent, the possibility of significant reductions in the liquidity or valuation of assets underlying those pools and the potential that clients will seek to hold us liable for such losses; and the possibility that our clients or regulators will assert claims that our fees, with respect to such investment products, are not appropriate or consistent with our fiduciary duties;

•our ability to anticipate and manage the level and timing of redemptions and withdrawals from our collateral pools and other collective investment products; 

•the credit agency ratings of our debt and depositary obligations and investor and client perceptions of our financial strength; 

•adverse publicity, whether specific to State Street or regarding other industry participants or industry-wide factors, or other reputational harm;

•our ability to expand our use of technology to enhance the efficiency, accuracy and reliability of our operations and our dependencies on information technology and our ability to control related risks, including cyber-crime, inadvertent data disclosures and other threats to our information technology infrastructure and systems (including those of our third-party service providers) and their effective operation both independently and with external systems, and complexities and costs of protecting the security of such systems and data; 

•changes or potential changes to the competitive environment, including due to regulatory and technological changes, the effects of industry consolidation and perceptions of State Street as a suitable service provider or counterparty; 

•our ability to complete acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required and the ability to satisfy closing conditions; 

•the risks that our acquired businesses, including our acquisition of Charles River Development, and joint ventures will not achieve their anticipated financial, operational and product innovation benefits or will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated; that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected negative 

11

synergies or liabilities will be experienced; that client and deposit retention goals will not be met; that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced; and that disruptions from the transaction will harm our relationships with our clients, our employees or regulators; 

•our ability to integrate Charles River Development's front office software solutions with our middle and back office capabilities to develop a front-to-middle-to-back office platform that is competitive and meets our clients requirements;

•our ability to recognize evolving needs of our clients and to develop products that are responsive to such trends and profitable to us; the performance of and demand for the products and services we offer; and the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk; 

•our ability to grow revenue, manage expenses, attract and retain highly skilled people and raise the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements and expectations; 

•changes in accounting standards and practices; and 

•the impact of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that affect the amount of taxes due. 

Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements are set forth in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent SEC filings. We encourage investors to read these filings, particularly the sections on risk factors, for additional information with respect to any forward-looking statements and prior to making any investment decision. The forward-looking statements contained in this News Release should not by relied on as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any time subsequent to the time this News Release is first issued, and we do not undertake efforts to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after that time.
