FARMINGTON, Conn., January 23, 2019 - United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) reported fourth quarter and full year 2018 results above expectations and announced an outlook for continued sales, earnings and free cash flow growth in 2019. 

“2018 was a transformational year for United Technologies,” said UTC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes. “We announced our intention to separate into three global, industry-leading companies, and closed the Rockwell Collins acquisition in November. We also delivered strong fourth quarter and full year 2018 results, including the best year of organic sales growth in over a decade, driven by our focus on meeting customer commitments, ongoing innovation, strong execution and cost reduction.”

Hayes continued, “Looking to 2019, our segment profit is expected to grow faster than sales, and free cash flow, excluding separation costs, is expected to grow faster than earnings. We remain laser focused on executing our strategic plans for our businesses, each of which is expected to drive sustained growth, lead the industry in innovation and customer focus, and maximize value creation over the long-term.” 

Fourth Quarter 2018

Fourth quarter sales of $18.0 billion were up 15 percent over the prior year, including 11 points of organic sales growth, 4 points of acquisition benefit and 1 point of foreign exchange headwind. The remaining 1 point of growth was 

driven by the adoption of the new Revenue Standard. GAAP EPS of $0.83 was up 66 percent versus the prior year and included $1.12 of net restructuring charges and other significant items, including a $692 million tax charge primarily related to undistributed foreign earnings. Adjusted EPS of $1.95 was up 22 percent. Fourth quarter results exceeded expectations primarily due to a favorable effective tax rate and better Rockwell Collins results.

Net income in the quarter was $0.7 billion, up 73 percent versus the prior year. Cash flow from operations was $2.0 billion and capital expenditures were $780 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.2 billion.

In the quarter, commercial aftermarket sales were up 11 percent at Pratt & Whitney and up 8 percent organically at Collins Aerospace Systems. Otis new equipment orders were flat organically versus the prior year. Equipment orders at Carrier increased 3 percent organically.

Full Year 2018 

Full year sales of $66.5 billion were up 11 percent over the prior year, including 8 points of organic sales growth, 1 point of net acquisitions impact and 1 point of foreign exchange tailwind. The remaining 1 point of growth was driven by the adoption of the new Revenue Standard and the absence of a customer contract settlement incurred in 2017. Full year GAAP EPS of $6.50 was up 14 percent versus the prior year and included $1.11 of net restructuring charges and other significant items, including a $692 million tax charge primarily related to undistributed foreign earnings. Adjusted EPS of $7.61 was up 14 percent. 

Net income for the year was $5.3 billion, up 16 percent versus the prior year. Cash flow from operations was $6.3 billion and capital expenditures were $1.9 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $4.4 billion.

In 2018, for the first time in over thirty years, Pratt & Whitney manufactured more than 1,000 large commercial and military engines. Collins Aerospace Systems was formed by the transformative acquisition of Rockwell Collins, a combination that is expected to result in more than $500 million in run-rate, pre-tax cost synergies. Carrier launched more than 100 new products, completed the acquisition of S2 Security and divested the Taylor Company. Finally, at Otis, the number of units under maintenance contract exceeded two million for the first time in the organization’s history. 

Outlook for 2019

UTC provides the following 2019 outlook*:

•Adjusted EPS of $7.70 to $8.00, including headwinds from a higher adjusted effective tax rate ($0.15 headwind) and a stronger U.S. dollar ($0.07 headwind);

•Sales of $75.5 to $77.0 billion, including organic sales growth of 3 to 5 percent;

•Free cash flow of $4.5 to $5.0 billion, including $1.5 billion of one-time cash payments related to the portfolio separation.

*Note: When we provide expectations for adjusted EPS, the adjusted effective tax rate, organic sales and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures generally is not available without unreasonable effort. See “Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information.

Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

United Technologies Corporation reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP information presented provides investors with additional useful information, but should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the related GAAP measures. Moreover, other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparisons with such other companies. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Adjusted net sales, organic sales, adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”), and the adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net sales represents consolidated net sales from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding significant items of a non-recurring and/or nonoperational nature (hereinafter referred to as “other significant items”). Organic sales represents consolidated net sales (a GAAP measure), excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures completed in the preceding twelve months and other significant items. Adjusted operating profit represents income from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. Adjusted net income represents net income from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. Adjusted EPS represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. The adjusted effective tax rate represents the effective tax rate (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. For the business segments, when applicable, adjustments of net sales, operating profit and margins similarly reflect continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other significant items. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures just mentioned are useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of the Company’s ongoing operational performance. 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents cash flow from operations (a GAAP measure) less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity and an additional basis for assessing 

UTC's ability to fund its activities, including the financing of acquisitions, debt service, repurchases of UTC's common stock and distribution of earnings to shareholders.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP appears in the tables in this Appendix. The tables provide additional information as to the items and amounts that have been excluded from the adjusted measures. 

When we provide our expectation for adjusted EPS, adjusted operating profit, adjusted effective tax rate, organic sales and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures (expected diluted EPS from continuing operations, operating profit, the effective tax rate, sales and expected cash flow from operations) generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to potentially high variability, complexity and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period, such as unusual gains and losses, the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact and timing of potential acquisitions and divestitures, and other structural changes or their probable significance. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results.
