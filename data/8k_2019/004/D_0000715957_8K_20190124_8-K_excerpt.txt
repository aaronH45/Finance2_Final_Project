2019 Annual Incentive Plan 

On January 24, 2019, the Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion Energy”) Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee (“CGN Committee”) approved the 2019 Annual Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Under the Plan, Dominion Energy’s officers are eligible for an annual performance-based cash award. Each officer has a target incentive award under the Plan based on a percentage of base salary. For 2019, the target percentages of base salary for Dominion Energy’s named executive officers are as follows: Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer – 150%; Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer – 90%; Executive Vice President and President & Chief Executive Officer – Power Generation Group – 90%; Executive Vice President and President & Chief Executive Officer – Gas Infrastructure Group – 90%; and Executive Vice President and President & Chief Executive Officer – Power Delivery Group – 90%. 

The Plan is funded based on the achievement of consolidated financial operating earnings goals, with potential funding ranging from 0% to 200% of the target funding. Payout of the amount funded under the Plan is subject to achievement of applicable consolidated financial, business unit financial, and operating and stewardship goals, including safety goals, diversity goals and environmental goals.  

2019 Long-Term Incentive Program 

On January 24, 2019, the CGN Committee approved the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Program (the “Program”) for its officers, including its named executive officers. The Program consists of two components: a restricted stock grant and a performance grant. The restricted stock is awarded pursuant to Dominion Energy’s 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan. The restricted stock is subject to a three-year cliff vesting period, while payout of the performance grant will be based on the achievement of two performance metrics: total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to a group of peer companies selected by the CGN Committee (weighted 50%) and return on invested capital (weighted 50%). There is also an opportunity to earn a portion of the award based on Dominion Energy’s absolute TSR and price-earnings ratio performance, regardless of relative TSR performance. The performance grant will have a performance period ending December 31, 2021, with payment made by March 15, 2022. The target value for the performance grant is equal to the grant date value of the restricted stock portion of the Program. Payout of the performance grant will vary depending on the level of achievement of the performance metrics. Each of the performance grants for the named executive officers other than Mr. James R. Chapman will be paid in cash; Mr. Chapman’s award will be paid in shares of Dominion Energy common stock.
