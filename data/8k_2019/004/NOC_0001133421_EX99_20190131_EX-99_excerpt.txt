FALLS CHURCH, Va. – Jan. 31, 2019 – Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported fourth quarter 2018 sales increased 24 percent to $8.2 billion. For 2018, sales increased 16 percent to $30.1 billion. Fourth quarter operating income increased 40 percent to $943 million and 2018 operating income increased 17 percent to $3.8 billion. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 operating results reflect the addition of Innovation Systems in June 2018.

As previously announced, the company retrospectively adopted the mark-to-market method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits (MTM) as of Dec. 31, 2018 and revised prior period results to reflect that change. This change resulted in an after-tax MTM expense of $495 million in 2018 and an after-tax MTM benefit of $404 million in 2017. As a result, fourth quarter 2018 net earnings decreased 47 percent to $356 million, or $2.06 per diluted share. 2018 net earnings increased 13 percent to $3.2 billion, or $18.49 per diluted share, also reflecting the MTM expense.

MTM-adjusted earnings1 and MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share1 are the measures the company will use to describe its comparative performance to prior periods and guide for diluted earnings per share.

MTM-adjusted fourth quarter and 2018 net earnings increased 220 percent and 51 percent, respectively, and for the same periods, MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share1 increased 224 percent to $4.93 and 52 percent to $21.33, respectively. The two main drivers were the addition of Innovation Systems in 2018 and the impacts related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) in 2017.

Fourth quarter and full year 2017 MTM-adjusted net earnings1 were reduced by higher tax expense resulting from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act and a discretionary pre-tax pension contribution, which together reduced MTM-adjusted net earnings1 by $302 million, or $1.72 per share, in both periods, primarily related to the write-down of deferred tax assets.

On Jan. 4, 2019, the company completed its previously announced $1 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR), which retired 3.84 million shares at an average price of approximately $260 per share. The remaining share repurchase authorization after completion of the ASR is approximately $4.1 billion.

“Our fourth quarter and full year financial results, along with our 2019 outlook, demonstrate that we are on a solid growth trajectory. I'm confident we are well positioned to deliver innovative and affordable solutions, with an enhanced degree of agility to create value for our customers and shareholders,” said Kathy Warden, chief executive officer and president.

Services. For 2018, sales increased 16 percent and reflect the same trends as described for the fourth quarter.

Fourth quarter segment operating income increased 43 percent to $927 million, and segment operating margin rate increased to 11.4 percent. The segment operating income increase reflects the acquisition of Innovation Systems and higher sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. The improvement in segment operating margin rate is due to improved performance at all three legacy Northrop Grumman sectors. For 2018, segment operating income increased 19 percent to $3.4 billion, and segment operating margin rate increased to 11.5 percent, and reflect the same trends as described for the fourth quarter.

Fourth quarter 2018 operating income and margin rate increased to $943 million and 11.6 percent, respectively, due to the 43 percent increase in segment operating income, partially offset by a $23 million increase in unallocated corporate expense. For 2018, operating income increased $562 million, or 17 percent, primarily due to the increase in segment operating income and a $42 million decrease in unallocated corporate expense, partially offset by a $25 million decrease in our net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment. The 2018 operating margin rate increased to 12.6 percent due to a higher segment operating margin rate, lower unallocated corporate expense, partially offset by a decrease in net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment.

Fourth quarter and 2018 results also reflect the company's adoption of the MTM method of accounting for its pension and other postretirement benefit (OPB) plans as of Dec. 31, 2018. Under MTM accounting, the company recognized a $655 million non-cash, pre-tax pension and OPB actuarial loss principally resulting from the difference between expected and actual plan asset returns in 2018 and the change in the company's actuarial discount rate. Net plan asset losses in 2018 were 3.5 percent compared with an expected 8.0 percent long-term rate of return, and the company's discount rate increased to 4.31 percent from 3.68 percent. Northrop Grumman has retrospectively applied the MTM method of accounting and revised prior period results. Schedule 6 of this release contains revised financial information for 2016, 2017 and each quarter of 2018. This method of accounting is preferable under U.S. GAAP as it aligns more closely with fair value principles by not delaying the recognition of gains and losses into future periods.

The company’s fourth quarter federal and foreign income tax expense declined to $47 million, reflecting the benefit of the 2017 Tax Act. The company's 2018 federal and foreign income tax expense declined to $513 million, principally due to the benefit of the 2017 Tax Act and a $56 million increase in research credits.

Non-GAAP measure — see definitions at the end of this earnings release.

Fourth quarter 2018 cash provided by operating activities increased to $2.4 billion and, for 2018, cash provided by operating activities increased to $3.8 billion. The increases in both periods are principally due to higher earnings and improved trade working capital performance, including the seasonality of Innovation Systems' cash flows weighted to the second half of the year, resulting in cash generation well in excess of Innovation Systems' earnings. Fourth quarter 2018 free cash flow before after-tax discretionary pension contributions increased to $1.9 billion and for 2018, free cash flow before after-tax discretionary pension contributions totaled $2.8 billion. In 2018, the company's pre-tax discretionary pension contributions totaled $280 million.

Aerospace Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Aerospace Systems fourth quarter 2018 sales increased 6 percent, principally due to higher volume for Manned Aircraft and Space programs. Higher volume for Manned Aircraft reflects increases in restricted activities, as well as higher volume for the F-35 program. Higher Space sales reflect increases in restricted activities and ramp-up activities for the new Enhanced Polar System Recapitalization program. Sales in Autonomous Systems were comparable to the prior year period.

For 2018, Aerospace Systems sales rose 8 percent, principally due to higher volume for restricted activities and the F-35 program in Manned Aircraft. The 2018 sales increase also includes higher volume for Autonomous Systems and Space programs. Autonomous Systems sales increase includes higher volume on several programs including Triton, Fire Scout and Firebird programs. Higher Space sales are principally due to volume increases for restricted activities and the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent TMRR program.

Aerospace Systems fourth quarter 2018 operating income increased 12 percent, and operating margin rate increased to 10.5 percent. Higher operating income reflects higher sales, and higher operating margin rate reflects improved performance for Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems programs. For 2018, operating income increased 9 percent and operating margin rate increased to 10.8 percent. Higher operating income reflects higher sales, and higher operating margin rate reflects improved performance for Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems.

Innovation Systems 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*In our comparative discussion below, we reference pro forma sales. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for consolidated pro forma information.

Innovation Systems fourth quarter 2018 sales increased 7 percent, compared with $1.4 billion pro forma sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. The sales increase was due to higher volume for Flight Systems and Defense Systems, partially offset by lower volume for Space Systems. Flight Systems sales reflect higher volume on a number of programs including the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), F-35 and Trident II programs. Defense Systems sales growth largely reflects higher international sales and higher volume on the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) program.

For 2018, Innovation Systems sales were $5.6 billion compared with $4.8 billion, each on a pro forma basis. The 17 percent increase reflects higher volume in all three business areas. Defense Systems sales growth largely reflects higher international sales and higher volume on AARGM and small caliber ammunition programs. Flight Systems sales were primarily driven by higher GMD, A350 and F-35 volume. Space Systems sales increased primarily due to higher government satellite volume.

Innovation Systems fourth quarter 2018 operating income totaled $143 million and operating margin rate was 9.8 percent. For 2018, operating income totaled $343 million and operating margin rate was 10.5 percent.

Mission Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mission Systems fourth quarter 2018 sales increased 2 percent principally due to higher volume for Sensors and Processing programs. Sales for Advanced Capabilities and Cyber and ISR were comparable to the prior year period. Higher Sensors and Processing sales are primarily due to higher volume on communications, F-35 and restricted programs. 

For 2018, Mission Systems sales increased 2 percent, principally due to higher volume for Sensors and Processing programs, partially offset by lower volume for Cyber and ISR and Advanced Capabilities programs. Sensors and Processing volume increased principally due to higher volume on restricted, communications, F-35 and electro-optical/infrared self-protection programs. Cyber and ISR sales declined primarily due to ramp-down on a restricted ISR program. Advanced Capabilities sales reflect lower volume on the JRDC program and follow on activity.

Mission Systems fourth quarter operating income increased 17 percent, and operating margin rate increased to 13.1 percent. The increase in operating income reflects higher sales volume and the 170 basis point improvement in operating margin rate reflects improved performance across the sector, principally on Cyber and ISR and Advanced Capabilities programs. For 2018, operating income increased 5 percent and operating margin rate increased to 13.0 percent. The increase in operating income reflects higher sales

and the increase in operating margin rate is principally due to improved performance on Cyber and ISR and Sensors and Processing programs. 

Technology Services

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Technology Services fourth quarter 2018 sales decreased 8 percent due to the completion of several programs, including KC-10 and JRDC. These declines were partially offset by higher volume on several other programs, including the Special Electronic Mission Aircraft program. For 2018, Technology Services sales decreased 8 percent due to the same trends described for the fourth quarter. 

Technology Services fourth quarter 2018 operating income increased 62 percent, and operating margin rate increased to 10.8 percent, principally due to contract close-out impacts of a state IT outsourcing program. For 2018, operating income decreased 1 percent due to lower volume, partially offset by a higher operating margin rate, which increased to 10.3 percent largely as a result of the noted contract close-out impacts.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Disclosure: This earnings release contains non-GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) financial measures, as defined by SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) Regulation G and indicated by a footnote in the text of the release. Definitions for the non-GAAP measures are provided below and reconciliations are provided in the body of the release. References to a “Table” in the definitions below relate to tables in the body of the release. Other companies may define these measures differently or may utilize different non-GAAP measures.

MTM-adjusted net earnings: Net earnings excluding MTM (expense) benefit and related tax impacts. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. This measure is also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of MTM accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company's operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. MTM-adjusted net earnings is reconciled in Table 1.

MTM-adjusted diluted EPS: Diluted earnings per share excluding the per share impact of MTM (expense) benefit and related tax impacts. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance per share by presenting the company’s diluted earnings per share results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. MTM-adjusted diluted EPS is reconciled in Table 1.

Segment operating income: Total earnings from our four segments, including allocated pension expense recognized under CAS, and excluding unallocated corporate items and FAS pension expense. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP. Segment operating income is reconciled in Table 1.

Segment operating margin rate: Segment operating income as defined above, and reconciled in Table 1, divided by sales. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Cash provided by operating activities before after-tax discretionary pension contributions: Cash provided by operating activities before the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Cash provided by operating activities before after-tax discretionary pension contributions has been provided for consistency and comparability of financial performance and is reconciled in Table 2.

Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, stock repurchases and the payment of dividends. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is reconciled in Table 2.

Free cash flow before after-tax discretionary pension contributions: Free cash flow before the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Free cash flow before after-tax discretionary pension contributions is a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, stock repurchases and the payment of dividends. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow before after-tax discretionary pension contributions is reconciled in Table 2.
