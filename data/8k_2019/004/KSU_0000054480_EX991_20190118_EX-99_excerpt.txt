“KCS has entered 2019 with a renewed and heightened focus on operational excellence. Throughout the year, we will implement principles of the Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) methodology that are most applicable to our network. We expect this focus on operational excellence and PSR principles to help drive improvement in asset utilization, cost and capital efficiency and customer satisfaction. 

“As we look forward, our confidence in topline growth and operational improvement is strong, supporting our outlook for an operating ratio of 60% to 61% by the year 2021.”

(a)The Company believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is meaningful as it allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of and adjustments to 2017 provisional income tax benefit for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and items that are not directly related to the ongoing operations of the Company. The income tax expense impacts related to these adjustments are calculated at the applicable statutory tax rate. 

(b)The Company believes adjusted operating expenses, operating income and operating ratio are meaningful as they allow investors to evaluate the Company's performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that are not directly related to the ongoing operations of the Company.

(c)Operating ratio is calculated by dividing operating expenses by revenues; or in the case of adjusted operating ratio, adjusted operating expenses divided by revenues.
