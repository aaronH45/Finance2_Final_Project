CEO Comments

“We completed another year of strong operating performance in 2018 which further positions the company for continued success in 2019,” said Sumit Roy, Realty Income’s President & Chief Executive Officer. “We invested $332 million in high-quality real estate during the fourth quarter, bringing us to approximately $1.8 billion in real estate investments for the year. Our portfolio continues to perform well with year-end occupancy of 98.6% and a rent recapture rate of 103% on re-leasing activity during the year. We remain conservatively capitalized, ending the year with a 5.3x Debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and we enter 2019 with ample liquidity and flexibility to continue growing earnings and dividends. 

Our investment pipeline remains solid, and we anticipate completing between $1.5 and $2.0 billion in real estate investments during 2019. Based on the strength of our operations and financial position, we are introducing 2019 AFFO per share guidance of $3.25 to $3.31, representing annual growth of approximately 2% to 4%.”

Financial Results

Revenue 

Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, increased 10.3% to $342.6 million, as compared to $310.7 million for the same quarter in 2017. Revenue for 2018 increased 9.2% to $1.328 billion, as compared to $1.216 billion for 2017.

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, was $85.1 million, as compared to $60.9 million for the same quarter in 2017. Net income per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, was $0.29, as compared to $0.22 for the same quarter in 2017. 

Net income available to common stockholders for 2018 was $363.6 million, as compared to $301.5 million for 2017. Net income per share for 2018 was $1.26, as compared to $1.10 for 2017.

Net income available to common stockholders and FFO in 2018 were impacted by a severance payment made to our former chief executive officer (CEO) in October 2018. The total value of cash, stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was $28.3 million; however, the net amount, after incorporating accruals for CEO compensation previous to this severance, was $18.7 million, equivalent to $0.06 per share. 

The calculation to determine net income for a real estate company includes impairments and gains on property sales. These items can vary from quarter to quarter and can significantly impact net income and period to period comparisons.

Funds From Operations Available to Common Stockholders (FFO)

FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, increased to $217.7 million, as compared to $171.0 million for the same quarter in 2017. FFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, increased to $0.73, as compared to $0.61 for the same quarter in 2017.

FFO for 2018 increased to $903.3 million, as compared to $772.7 million for 2017. FFO per share for 2018 increased to $3.12, as compared to $2.82 for 2017.

Adjusted Funds From Operations Available to Common Stockholders (AFFO)

AFFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, increased 10.0% to $236.8 million, as compared to $215.3 million for the same quarter in 2017. AFFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, increased 3.9% to $0.79, as compared to $0.76 for the same quarter in 2017.

AFFO for 2018 increased 10.3% to $924.6 million, as compared to $838.6 million for 2017. AFFO per share for 2018 increased 4.2% to $3.19, as compared to $3.06 for 2017.

The company considers FFO and AFFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of a Real Estate Investment Trust’s (REIT’s) operating performance. Realty Income defines FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ (NAREIT’s) definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairments of real estate assets, and reduced by gains on property sales. AFFO further adjusts FFO for unique revenue and expense items, which the company believes are not as pertinent to the measurement of the company’s ongoing operating performance. Presentation of the information regarding FFO and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO in the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. In addition, FFO and AFFO should not be considered as measures of liquidity, our ability to make cash distributions, or our ability to pay interest payments. See the reconciliations of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and AFFO on pages seven and eight of this press release. 

Dividend Increases 

In December 2018, Realty Income announced the 85th consecutive quarterly dividend increase, which is the 99th increase in the amount of the dividend since the company’s listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1994. The annualized dividend amount as of December 31, 2018 was $2.652 per share. The company distributed $761.6 million in common dividends to shareholders in 2018, representing 82.4% of our 2018 AFFO of $924.6 million, and the amount of monthly dividends paid per share increased 4.1% to $2.631 in 2018, as compared to $2.527 in 2017.

In January 2019, Realty Income announced an increase to the amount of the February annualized dividend to $2.706 per share, as compared to the February 2018 annualized dividend amount of $2.628 per share, which represents an increase of 3.0%. The new monthly dividend amount of $0.2255 per share was paid on February 15, 2019.

Credit Facility

In October 2018, we entered into a new $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility to amend and restate our previous $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility, of which $2.0 billion was due to expire in June 2019. This new credit facility includes a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a new $250 million unsecured term loan due March 2024. The new revolving credit facility matures in March 2023 and includes two six-month extensions that can be exercised at our option. The new revolving credit facility also has a $1.0 billion expansion feature. Under the new revolving credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 0.775% with a facility commitment fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.90% over LIBOR. This compares favorably to our previous $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility, which had all-in drawn pricing of 0.975% over LIBOR. As of December 31, 2018, we had a borrowing capacity of $2.75 billion on the revolving credit facility.

In conjunction with our new revolving credit facility and as referenced above, we entered into a $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan, which matures in March 2024. Borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current one-month LIBOR, plus 0.85%. In conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest on this term loan at 3.89%. 

2019 Earnings Guidance 

We estimate AFFO per share for 2019 of $3.25 to $3.31. AFFO adjusts FFO for unique revenue and expense items, which are not as pertinent to the measurement of Realty Income’s ongoing operating performance.

We estimate FFO per share for 2019 of $3.23 to $3.29. FFO per share for 2019 is based on a net income per share range of $1.36 to $1.42, plus estimated real estate depreciation and impairments of $1.92 per share, and reduced by potential estimated gains on sales of investment properties of $0.05 per share (in accordance with NAREIT’s definition of FFO).
