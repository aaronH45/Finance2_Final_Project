 Item 5.03  

Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On February 13, 2019, the Board of Directors of Verisk Analytics, Inc. (the “Company”) amended and restated the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) to implement proxy access, effective immediately. The Board implemented terms which it believes will provide meaningful proxy access for shareholders while limiting the potential for abuse and will advance the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders.  

The Bylaws include a revised Section 2.10 that permits a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least three percent of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s annual meeting proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two directors or twenty percent of the Board, provided that the shareholders and nominees satisfy the requirements and such other limitations as specified in the Bylaws.  

The description of the Bylaws set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended and Restated Bylaws, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
