•Signed leases for 573,923 square feet of comparable space (622,234 square feet total) in the fourth quarter at an average rent of $32.16 per square foot and achieved cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 15%. Over the last four quarters, cash basis rollover growth on comparable spaces was 12%.

Financial Results

For the full year 2018, Federal Realty reported net income available for common shareholders of $233.9 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.18. This compares to net income available for common shareholders of $287.5 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.97 for the full year 2017. Net income available for common shareholders was $52.5 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.71 for the fourth quarter 2018 versus $48.6 million and $0.67, respectively, for the fourth quarter 2017.

For the full year 2018, Federal Realty generated funds from operations available for common shareholders (FFO) of $461.8 million, or $6.23 per diluted share. This compares to FFO of $420.0 million, or $5.74 per diluted share, for the full year 2017. Excluding the $12.3 million early extinguishment of debt charge in the fourth quarter 2017, FFO per diluted share for the full year 2017 would have been $5.91. For the fourth quarter 2018, FFO was $117.2 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared to $95.5 million, or $1.30 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2017 ($1.47 if the early extinguishment of debt charge was excluded).

FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the Trust considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.

Portfolio Results

The overall portfolio was 94.6% leased as of December 31, 2018, and the comparable portfolio was 95.1% leased. Comparable property POI increased 3.1% for the year 2018 and 2.0% in the fourth quarter. Comparable property POI represents our consolidated property portfolio other than those properties that distort comparability between periods in two primary categories (1) assets that were not owned for the full quarter in both periods presented and (2) assets currently under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment.

For the year 2018, Federal Realty signed 402 leases for 2.0 million square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), Federal Realty leased 1.9 million square feet at an average rent of $34.11 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $30.37 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases, representing a cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 12%. 

During fourth quarter 2018, Federal Realty signed 114 leases for 622,234 square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), Federal Realty leased 573,923 square feet at an average rent of $32.16 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $27.96 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases, representing a cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 15%.

Notes:

(1)There is no guarantee that the Trust will ultimately complete any or all of these opportunities, that the Projected Return on Investment (ROI) or Projected Costs will be the amounts shown or that stabilization will occur as anticipated. The projected ROI and Projected Cost are management's best estimate based on current information and may change over time. 

(2)Projected ROI for redevelopment projects generally reflects only the deal specific cash, unleveraged incremental Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the redevelopment and is calculated as Incremental POI divided by incremental cost. Incremental POI is the POI generated by the redevelopment after deducting rent being paid or management's estimate of rent to be paid for the redevelopment space and any other space taken out of service to accommodate the redevelopment. Projected ROI for redevelopment projects does NOT include peripheral impacts, such as the impact on future lease rollovers at the property or the impact on the long-term value of the property.  

(3)Stabilization is generally the year in which 90% physical occupancy of the redeveloped space is achieved. Economic stabilization may occur at a later point in time. 

(4)All subtotals and totals reflect cost weighted-average ROIs. 

(5)Projected cost is net of the proceeds from our New Market Tax Credit structure. See Note 3 of our December 31, 2018 Form 10-K for additional information.

Notes:

(1)Expected opening dates, total cost, projected return on investment (ROI), and projected POI percentages are subject to adjustment as a result of factors inherent in the development process, some of which may not be under the direct control of the Company. Refer to the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for other risk factors.

(2)Percentage figures reflect (i) the projected POI (herein defined) for the stated year divided by (ii) the current projected annual stabilized POI for the Property. These percentages are projections only and we cannot give any assurances that these amounts will actually be achieved.

(3)Projected ROI for development projects reflects the unleveraged Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the development and is calculated as POI divided by cost.

(4)Projected costs for Assembly Row and Pike & Rose include an allocation of infrastructure costs for the entire project.

(5)Costs are net of expected reimbursement by third parties and land sale proceeds. Phase II total costs and costs to date include our share of the costs in the hotel.

(6)Condominiums shown at cost; the projected ROI for Phase II does not assume any incremental profit on the sale of condominium units; for return calculation purposes, condominiums are assumed to be sold at cost.

Glossary of Terms

EBITDA for Real Estate ("EBITDAre"): EBITDAre is a non-GAAP measure that the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines as: net income computed in accordance with GAAP plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of real estate, impairments of real estate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. We calculate EBITDAre consistent with the NAREIT definition. As EBITDA is a widely known and understood measure of performance, management believes EBITDAre represents an additional non-GAAP performance measure, independent of a company's capital structure, that will provide investors with a uniform basis to measure the enterprise value of a company. EBITDAre also approximates a key performance measure in our debt covenants, but it should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDAre for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) For the periods noted above, the provision for income tax primarily relates to condominium sales gains.

Funds From Operations (FFO): FFO is a supplemental measure of real estate companies' operating performances. NAREIT defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with GAAP plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on sale of real estate, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity REIT in order to recognize that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. However, FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to pay dividends. We consider FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 

Property Operating Income: Rental income, other property income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes.

Overall Portfolio: Includes all operating properties owned in reporting period.

Comparable Properties: Represents our consolidated property portfolio other than those properties that distort comparability between periods in two primary categories: (1) assets that were not owned for the full quarter in both periods presented and (2) assets currently under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment. Comparable property growth statistics are calculated on a GAAP basis. 

Tenant Improvements and Incentives: Represents not only the total dollars committed for the improvement (fit-out) of a space as it relates to a specific lease and, except for redevelopments, may also include base building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.
