“We are pleased with the advancements made in 2018 to further build our franchise for the long-term with investments in revenue producing initiatives and talent as well as enhancements to our digital capabilities and technology infrastructure,” said Jack Barnes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “While making these important strategic investments, we continued to strengthen the profitability of the Company. Full year operating earnings of $461.4 million were up 33 percent from a year ago despite loan growth headwinds. In addition, operating earnings per common share of $1.31 increased for the ninth consecutive year. We also remain focused on balancing organic growth with thoughtful M&A. The integration of First Connecticut   

continues to progress extremely well and we were excited to announce in November the acquisition of BSB Bancorp, which will deepen our presence in the Greater Boston area. Consistent with this strategy, we disclosed today the all-cash acquisition of VAR Technology Finance, which focuses on serving the technology sector and is ranked among the top independent, privately held equipment finance companies nationwide for new business volume. Similar to our recent equipment financing acquisitions, this transaction further deepens the Company’s network of specialty finance experts and bolsters our nationwide businesses. Looking ahead to 2019, we are excited about realizing on the opportunities across our diverse portfolio of businesses, deepening customer relationships and delivering value to shareholders.”  

“Our fourth quarter financial performance resulted in a strong finish to the year as evidenced by another quarter of record earnings, an operating return on average tangible common equity of 15.5 percent and a 160 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio compared to the third quarter,” said David Rosato, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Operating earnings of $134.2 million increased 18 percent linked-quarter and benefited from the First Connecticut acquisition and further net interest margin expansion. The quarter was also favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate which reflected discrete tax benefits associated with certain tax-advantaged investments as well as a benefit realized in connection with tax reform. Excluding the addition of First Connecticut, period-end loan and deposit balances grew one percent and two percent, respectively, from September 30th. Loan growth benefited from strong production in equipment financing as well as in our healthcare and large corporate verticals. These results were partially offset by lower mortgage warehouse lending balances and continued runoff of the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio.”

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP  

In addition to evaluating People’s United Financial Inc. (“People’s United”) results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible common equity ratios, tangible book value per common share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People’s United’s underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are used to analyze the relative strength of People’s United’s capital position.  

The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People’s United to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding operating lease expense, goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income, the netting of operating lease expense and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans and acquired loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People’s United generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.  

Operating earnings exclude from net income available to common shareholders those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People’s United’s results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to: (i) non-recurring gains/losses; (ii) merger-related expenses, including acquisition integration and other costs; (iii) writedowns of banking house assets and related lease termination costs; (iv) severance-related costs; and (v) charges related to executive-level management separation costs, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per common share (“EPS”) is derived by determining the per common share impact of the respective adjustments to arrive at operating earnings and adding (subtracting) such amounts to (from) diluted EPS, as reported. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average total assets. Operating return on average tangible common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible common equity. The operating common dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing common dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.  

The tangible common equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible common equity (total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the denominator). Tangible book value per common share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) common shares).  

In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People’s United for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.
