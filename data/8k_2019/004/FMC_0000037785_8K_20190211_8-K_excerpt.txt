ITEM 5.04. TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF TRADING UNDER REGISTRANT’S EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

On February 11, 2019, FMC Corporation (“FMC”) sent a notice (the “Blackout Notice”) to its directors and “officers” (as defined pursuant to Rule 16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) regarding a blackout period (the “Blackout Period”) that will be imposed on the FMC Corporation Savings and Investment Plan, the FMC Corporation Non-Qualified Savings and Investment Plan and the Livent Corporation Non-Qualified Savings and Investment Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) for Plan participants with an investment in the FMC common stock fund under the Plans (the “FMC Stock Fund”). 

The Blackout Period will be implemented in connection with the anticipated pro rata spin-off distribution (the “Distribution”) by FMC of its remaining ownership of shares of Livent Corporation common stock to FMC shareholders of record as of the record date for the Distribution, including Plan participants who hold shares of FMC common stock as a result of their investment in the FMC Stock Fund. 

The Blackout Period will be necessary in order to process transactions relating to the Distribution under the Plans, including the need to modify the FMC Corporation Qualified Savings and Investment Plan and the Livent Corporation Non-Qualified Savings Plan to create an investment fund to hold the shares of Livent Corporation common stock received by Plan participants invested in the FMC Stock Fund in connection with the Distribution. As a result, during the Blackout Period, Plan participants invested in the FMC Stock Fund will be restricted from all transactions involving the FMC Stock Fund, including exchanges or rebalancings into and out of the FMC Stock Fund, and will not have the ability to take loans, withdrawals or distributions from any portion of their Plan accounts, including the portion invested in the FMC Stock Fund.

The Blackout Period is expected to begin at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (typically 4:00 PM EST) on February 21, 2019 and end during the calendar week of March 3, 2019. 

The Blackout Notice informed FMC’s directors and officers that, during the Blackout Period, subject to certain limited exemptions, they will be prohibited from directly or indirectly purchasing, selling, acquiring or transferring any FMC common stock or derivative securities with respect to shares of FMC common stock acquired in connection with their service or employment as a director or officer of FMC. The Blackout Notice also informed FMC’s directors and officers that the Blackout Period restrictions are separate from, and in addition to, any other restrictions on trading FMC equity securities currently applicable to them. 

It is possible that the necessary actions and modifications applicable each Plan in connection with the Distribution may be completed in three consecutive business days or less. FMC’s directors and officers will be notified as soon as reasonably practicable if the Blackout Period restrictions described in the Blackout Notice are not applicable to either of the Plans. 

Any inquiries during the Blackout Period may be directed to:
