EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY 

“Zoetis delivered another year of strong performance in 2018 and executed on investment plans that continue to strengthen our product portfolio across the continuum of care,” said Juan Ramón Alaix, Chief Executive Officer of Zoetis. “We achieved operational revenue growth for the year of 10%, growing revenue across all of our core species, major markets and therapeutic areas. We also grew our adjusted net income faster than sales, at 31% operationally, as we continue to deliver on our long-term value proposition.”

“Looking ahead, we will continue to build on our strategic investment plans to support the growth of our core business, and in evolving spaces such as diagnostics, devices, digital and data analytics. For full year 2019, we expect operational growth of 7.5% to 9.5% in revenue and 8% to 11% in adjusted net income. We remain committed to funding investments that will help us maintain our leadership and growth, while returning excess capital to shareholders.”

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and operational results (which exclude the impact of foreign exchange), to assess and analyze our results and trends and to make financial and operational decisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors because they provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release should not be considered alternatives to measurements required by GAAP, such as net income, operating income, and earnings per share, and should not be considered measures of liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release and are posted on our website at www.zoetis.com.

Internet Posting of Information: We routinely post information that may be important to investors in the 'Investors' section of our website at www.zoetis.com, on our Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/zoetis and on Twitter @zoetis. We encourage investors and potential investors to consult our website regularly and to follow us on Facebook and Twitter for important information about us.

2019 GUIDANCE 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January 2019.

Reconciliations of 2019 reported guidance to 2019 adjusted guidance follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Operational growth (a non-GAAP financial measure) excludes the impact of foreign exchange.

(b)Organic operational growth (a non-GAAP financial measure) excludes the impact of the acquisition of Abaxis as well as foreign exchange.

(c)Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses, and adjusted interest expense and other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. 

(d)We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted net income operational growth to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial measure because we are unable to calculate with reasonable certainty the foreign exchange impact of unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, potential future asset impairments and other certain significant items, without unreasonable effort. The foreign exchange impacts of these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. 

(e)Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to the acquisition of Abaxis and other charges.
