   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

EXPEDITORS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2018 EPS OF $1.02 

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - February 19, 2019, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced fourth quarter 2018 financial results including the following highlights compared to the same quarter of 2017:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders increased 7% to $179 million 

•Operating Income increased 9% to $217 million

•Revenues increased 18% to $2.24 billion[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Airfreight tonnage volumes increased 2% and ocean container volumes increased 10%

“The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a record year of growth in revenues, net revenues, volumes, and profitability,” said Jeffrey S. Musser, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The air and ocean markets have continued to be highly unpredictable, with ongoing shifts in the balance of supply and demand requiring extra attention to address the needs of each individual customer. These are the conditions when our people really prove themselves, as they did in Q4 and throughout the year. I commend them for continuing to grow volumes in ocean and air, with a determined focus on profitability. During the quarter, our air and customs brokerage segments were particularly strong once again. In addition, we further improved our ocean business by growing volumes while adjusting sell rates. We accomplished all of this in spite of ongoing rate pressure, as the industry evolves and carriers continue to test the supply/demand imbalance.

“Throughout 2018, we did a terrific job of growing net revenues ahead of headcount and related costs,” Mr. Musser continued. “We also generated improved efficiencies, while establishing a selective mix of business partners who value an elevated level of customer service. Our ability to perform well comes from our deeply ingrained, core culture that puts customer service at the forefront.”

Bradley S. Powell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, “We carefully managed expenses as net revenues grew during the quarter, demonstrating the effectiveness of our processes and technology. During the quarter, net revenues grew at roughly twice the rate of headcount and related expenses, and, at nearly 32%, our fourth quarter operating efficiency (operating income as a percentage of net revenue) was the highest since Q2 2016.”

Mr. Powell noted that the Company’s effective tax rate for the full year was 24.3%, compared to 31.8% in 2017. The Company’s lower effective tax rates were principally due to the lower U.S. federal tax rate that resulted from the 2017 Tax Act, significant share-based compensation deductions, U.S. federal tax credits from withholding taxes related to our foreign operations, and deductions for foreign-derived intangible income. Mr. Powell reiterated that the Company’s effective tax rate will be largely dependent upon the mix of pretax earnings that are generated in its U.S. versus foreign operations, as well as any further interpretations and guidance issued on the tax law in the future.

Net Revenues (Non-GAAP measure)

We commonly refer to the term “net revenues” when commenting about our Company and the results of its operations. Net revenues are a Non-GAAP measure calculated as revenues less directly related operating expenses attributable to the Company's principal services. We believe that net revenues are a better measure than are total revenues when analyzing and discussing our effectiveness in managing our principal services since total revenues earned as a freight consolidator include the carriers' charges to us for carrying the shipment, whereas revenues earned in other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees earned by us. Net revenue is one of our primary operational and financial measures and demonstrates our ability to concentrate and leverage purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings. Using net revenues also provides a commonality for comparison among various services. The following table presents the calculation of net revenues.
