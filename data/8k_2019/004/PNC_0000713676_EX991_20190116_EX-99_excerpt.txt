We grew loans and deposits, and expanded to new markets with our middle market corporate banking franchise and the successful launch of our national retail digital strategy. Supported by our strong capital and liquidity positions, we are entering 2019 well positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders.”

Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased $15 million compared with the third quarter and $136 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Higher loan and securities yields and balances were partially offset by higher deposit and borrowing costs in both comparisons reflecting the impact of interest rate increases. The net interest margin was 2.96 percent for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 2.99 percent for the third quarter and 2.88 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 declined $32 million compared with the third quarter as lower fee income was somewhat offset by higher other noninterest income.

Consumer service fees grew $10 million due to seasonally higher credit card and merchant services activity and higher brokerage revenue. Corporate service fees increased $3 million primarily due to higher loan syndication and other fees substantially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees. Residential mortgage revenue decreased $17 million reflecting a $19 million negative adjustment for residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge, driven by a decline in long-term interest rates at quarter end. Service charges on deposits grew $6 million as a result of a seasonal increase in consumer spending.

Other noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased $24 million primarily due to positive derivative fair value adjustments of $42 million related to Visa Class B common shares in the fourth quarter compared with negative adjustments of $32 million in the third quarter and higher gains on asset sales partially offset by lower revenue from private equity investments. 

Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased $56 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Asset management revenue declined $292 million reflecting a $254 million fourth quarter 2017 flow-through impact of tax legislation on PNC's equity investment in BlackRock.

Other noninterest income increased $166 million due to $248 million of fourth quarter 2017 negative derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class B common shares compared with positive adjustments of $42 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset by a fourth quarter 2017 benefit of $119 million for appreciation in value of BlackRock stock contributed to the PNC Foundation. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased $31 million compared with the third quarter.

Equipment expense increased $21 million in part due to technology-related depreciation. Marketing expense increased $13 million driven by the national retail digital strategy. Other noninterest expense declined $7 million reflecting the fourth quarter elimination of a $36 million quarterly FDIC deposit insurance surcharge assessment partially offset by higher expense for business activities. 

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased $484 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 included significant items of $502 million consisting of a$200 million contribution to the PNC Foundation, $197 million of charges for real estate dispositions and exits, and $105 million of personnel expense for employee cash payments and pension account credits. Excluding the impact of these items, noninterest expense increased $18 million, or 1 percent, in support of business growth. 

The effective tax rate was 16.3 percent for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 15.7 percent for the third quarter, and 16.8 percent for full year 2018. The federal statutory tax rate was lowered to 21.0 percent effective January 1, 2018.

Additionally, the comparison to fourth quarter 2017 reflected growth in consumer service fees and service charges on deposits. Provision for credit losses decreased compared with fourth quarter 2017 primarily due to lower home equity and credit card loan provisions. Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison with the third quarter reflecting timing of technology costs and the fourth quarter elimination of the quarterly FDIC deposit insurance surcharge assessment partially offset by increased marketing related to the national retail digital strategy. Noninterest expense declined compared with fourth quarter 2017 due to lower personnel and branch occupancy costs, lower legal expense and the reduced FDIC assessment partially offset by higher noncredit losses, equipment expense and marketing.

CAPITAL RATIOS

Because PNC remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2018 and 2017 are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures. With the exception of certain nonqualifying trust preferred capital securities included in PNC's Total risk-based capital, the transitions and multi-year phase-in of the definition of capital under the Basel III rules were completed as of January 1, 2018. Accordingly, we refer to the capital ratios calculated using the definition of capital in effect as of January 1, 2018 and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized risk-weighted assets, as the Basel III ratios. We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions in effect for 2017 and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets, as the 2017 Transitional Basel III ratios. 

We provide information below regarding PNC’s estimated Basel III December 31, 2018, actual Basel III September 30, 2018, Fully Phased-In Basel III December 31, 2017 and actual December 31, 2017 Transitional Basel III Common equity Tier 1 ratios. Under the Basel III rules applicable to PNC, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions (for PNC, primarily BlackRock), mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (subject to a phase-in schedule that ended December 31, 2017 and net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institution's adjusted common equity Tier 1 capital. Also, Basel III regulatory capital includes (subject to a phase-in schedule that ended December 31, 2017) accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to securities currently and those transferred from, available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans.

(a)2018 results are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during 2018 and reflects the full phase-in of all Basel III adjustments to this metric applicable to PNC. 

(b)2017 Fully Phased-In Basel III results are presented as pro forma estimates.

(c)Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.

(d)Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market and operational risk-weighted assets. During the parallel run qualification phase, PNC has refined the data, models and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets. We anticipate additional refinements through the parallel run qualification phase.

Our Basel III capital ratios may be impacted by changes to the regulatory capital rules, additional regulatory guidance or analysis, and, in the case of those ratios calculated using the advanced approaches, may be subject to variability based on the ongoing evolution, validation and regulatory approval of PNC’s models that are integral to the calculation of advanced approaches risk-weighted assets as PNC moves through the parallel run approval process.

Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated based on tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end common shares outstanding. We believe this non-GAAP measure serves as a useful tool to help evaluate the strength and discipline of a company's capital management strategies and as an additional, conservative measure of total company value.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information

We make statements in this news release and related conference call, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting PNC and its future business and operations that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions. 

Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance.

Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.

▪Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following:

–Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets.

–Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets.

–Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates.

–Changes in customer behavior due to recently enacted tax legislation, changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives.

–Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness.

–Impacts of tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners.

–Slowing or reversal of the current U.S. economic expansion.

–Commodity price volatility.

▪Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our view that U.S. economic growth has accelerated over the past two years to above its long-run trend, due to stimulus from corporate and personal income tax cuts passed in late 2017 and an increase in federal government spending. We expect further gradual improvement in the labor market this year, including job gains and rising wages, will be another positive for consumer spending. However, growth is expected to slow over the course of 2019 as fiscal stimulus fades. Trade restrictions and geopolitical concerns are downside risks to the forecast. Inflation is expected to slow in the first half of 2019, to below the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2 percent objective, because of lower energy prices. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are expected to rise very slowly in 2019. Our baseline forecast is for one more increase in the federal funds rate, in September 2019, pushing the rate to a range of 2.50 to 2.75 percent in the second half of this year.

▪PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board as part of PNC’s comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and non-objection to such capital actions by the Federal Reserve Board.

▪PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information (Continued)

▪Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:

–Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles. 

–Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards.

–Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to PNC.

–Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.

–Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.

▪Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. 

▪Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information provided to us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings.

▪We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.

▪Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.

▪Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.

We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2017 Form 10-K and our 2018 Form 10-Qs, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in those reports, and in our subsequent SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those we may discuss elsewhere in this news release or in our SEC filings, accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our corporate website at www.pnc.com/secfilings.
