Item 8.01 Other Events. 

On February 26, 2019, Livingston L. Satterthwaite, Vice President and President, Distribution Business, of Cummins Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan (the "Satterthwaite 10b5-1 Plan") to exercise options to purchase a limited number of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), and to sell the shares acquired on exercise. The Satterthwaite 10b5-1 Plan allows for the exercise of options to purchase a maximum of 8,450 shares of Common Stock if the Common Stock reaches a specified market price during the period commencing sixty days after adoption of the Satterthwaite 10b5-1 Plan and continuing until the options to purchase all 8,450 shares have been exercised and the acquired shares sold, or February 26, 2020, whichever occurs first. The shares acquired upon exercise will be sold contemporaneously with the exercise. Based on his current ownership of Common Stock, if the options to purchase all of the 8,450 shares of Common Stock subject to the Satterthwaite 10b5-1 Plan were exercised in full, and all of the shares acquired upon exercise were sold, Mr. Satterthwaite would own approximately 42,127 shares of Common Stock. 

The Satterthwaite 10b5-1 Plan was designed to comply with the Company's insider trading policies and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which permit an officer or director to enter into a pre-arranged plan for buying or selling Company stock at a time when the officer or director is not in possession of material, nonpublic information about the Company. Mr. Satterthwaite will continue to be subject to the Company's stock ownership guidelines, and the sales contemplated by the Satterthwaite 10b5-1 Plan will not reduce his ownership of Common Stock below the level required by the guidelines. 

All sales of Common Stock under the Satterthwaite 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations through appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
