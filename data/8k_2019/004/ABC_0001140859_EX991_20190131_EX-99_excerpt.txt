FISCAL 2019 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

Revenues of $45.4 Billion for the First Quarter, a 12.2 Percent Increase Year-Over-Year

First Quarter GAAP Diluted EPS of $1.84 and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $1.60 

Adjusted Diluted EPS Guidance Narrowed to $6.65 to $6.85 For Fiscal 2019

VALLEY FORGE, PA, January 31, 2019 - AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE:ABC) today reported that in its fiscal year 2019 first quarter ended December 31, 2018, revenue increased 12.2 percent to $45.4 billion. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.84 for the December quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $3.90 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes items described below, increased 3.2 percent to $1.60 in the fiscal first quarter. 

The Company narrowed its adjusted diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 to $6.65 to $6.85. The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, as discussed below in Fiscal Year 2019 Expectations. 

“We are pleased with the strong start in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The overall strength and performance of AmerisourceBergen’s portfolio of core Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses delivered outstanding results to help offset the headwind from PharMEDium. We are extremely proud and recognize that this would not have been possible without the execution by our dedicated associates,” said Steven H. Collis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of AmerisourceBergen.

“Our fiscal 2019 outlook remains strong, even as we narrowed fiscal 2019 guidance to reflect the extended delay in the reopening of PharMEDium's Memphis facility. AmerisourceBergen's strategic partnerships, leadership in Specialty distribution and services, and strong balance sheet position the company to continue to deliver growth, while we actively work to resolve the challenges at PharMEDium,” Mr. Collis continued. “We remain confident in our ability to execute, evolve and transform our business to meet the complex needs of our customers, drive long-term value for our shareholders and ultimately enable access for patients. More than ever, we are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.”

Segment Discussion

The Company's operations are comprised of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment and other operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and, therefore, have been included in Other for the purpose of reportable segment presentation. Other consists of operating segments that focus on global commercialization services and animal health and includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS), World Courier and MWI Animal Health (MWI).

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services Segment

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue was $43.7 billion, an increase of 12.3 percent compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Segment operating income of $373.2 million in the December quarter of fiscal 2019 was down 3.9 percent compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, due to a loss at PharMEDium compared to a significant contribution in the prior year period.

Other

Revenue in Other was $1.7 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, an increase of 8.2 percent compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the January 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in Brazil, growth at World Courier and ABCS's growth in its Canadian operations. Operating income in Other decreased 1.3 percent to $98.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a decline in operating income at MWI and the Lash consulting group within ABCS, and was partially offset by the increased contribution from World Courier.

Fiscal Year 2019 Expectations

The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. Please refer to the Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures following the tables for additional information.

Fiscal Year 2019 Expectations on an Adjusted (non-GAAP) Basis

AmerisourceBergen has updated its fiscal year 2019 financial guidance based upon the Company’s evaluation of business expectations at PharMEDium which reflect the assumption that its Memphis facility will not reopen in this fiscal year. Updated guidance also incorporates the higher than anticipated level of share repurchases in the first quarter of the fiscal year. The company now expects:

•Adjusted Diluted EPS range narrowed to $6.65 to $6.85 from the previous range of $6.65 to $6.95.

Additional expectations now include:

•Adjusted operating income growth in the low-single digit percent range, down from low- to mid-single digit percent range;

◦Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment operating income growth in the low-single digit percent range, down from low- to mid-single digit percent range;

•Weighted average diluted shares are now expected to be approximately 215 million for the fiscal year, down from the previous expectation of 216 million.

All other previously communicated aspects of the Company's fiscal year 2019 financial guidance and assumptions remain the same.

D. Smith and PharMEDium, or the inability to capture all of the anticipated synergies related thereto or to capture the anticipated synergies within the expected time period; the effects of disruption from the transactions on the respective businesses of the Company and H. D. Smith and the fact that the transactions may make it more difficult to establish or maintain relationships with employees, suppliers, customers and other business partners; the Company's ability to manage and complete divestitures; the disruption of the Company's cash flow and ability to return value to its stockholders in accordance with its past practices; interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; declining economic conditions in the United States and abroad; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors affecting the Company's business generally.

10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and elsewhere in that report and (ii) in other reports filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to perform financial planning, and to determine incentive compensation. Therefore, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. The presented non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that management does not believe reflect the Company’s core operating performance because such items are outside the control of the Company or are inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash. We have included the following non-GAAP earnings-related financial measures in this release:

•Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin: Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the gain from antitrust litigation settlements, certain PharMEDium remediation costs, LIFO expense (credit), and costs (credit) related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act. Gain from antitrust litigation settlements and LIFO expense (credit) are excluded because the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. PharMEDium remediation costs are excluded because they are unpredictable and non-recurring expenses. The reversal of the previously-estimated assessment related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act is excluded because it is unusual, non-recurring and non-cash. Adjusted gross profit margin is the ratio of adjusted gross profit to total revenue. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as a supplemental measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. The gain from antitrust litigation settlements relates to the settlement of lawsuits that have been filed against brand pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging that the manufacturer, by itself or in concert with others, took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drugs from entering the market. The PharMEDium remediation costs relate to costs incurred in connection with suspended production activities following U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspections. LIFO expense (credit) is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. The New York State Opioid Stewardship Act, which went into effect on July 1, 2018, established an annual $100 million fund and requires manufacturers, distributors, and importers to ratably share the assessment based upon opioids sold or distributed to or within New York state. In December 2018, the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. District for the Southern District of New York. 

•Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating expense margin: Adjusted operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes acquisition-related intangibles amortization, employee severance, litigation, and other, and certain PharMEDium remediation costs. Adjusted operating expense margin is the ratio of adjusted operating expenses to total revenue. Acquisition-related intangibles amortization is excluded because it is a non-cash item and does not reflect the operating performance of the acquired companies. We exclude employee severance amounts that relate to unpredictable and/or non-recurring business restructuring. We exclude the amount of litigation settlements and other expenses, as well as PharMEDium remediation costs, that are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature because we believe these exclusions facilitate the analysis of our ongoing operational performance.

•Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin: Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted operating income margin is the ratio of adjusted operating income to total revenue. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company’s performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted income before income taxes: Adjusted income before income taxes is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted operating income. In addition, the loss on the early retirement of debt is also excluded from adjusted income before income taxes. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it facilitates the calculation of the Company’s adjusted effective tax rate.

•Adjusted effective tax rate: Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure that is determined by dividing adjusted income tax expense/benefit by adjusted income before income taxes.

•Adjusted income tax expense (benefit): Adjusted income tax expense is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the income tax expense (benefit) associated with the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted income 

before income taxes. In addition, the one-time U.S. tax reform ("Tax Reform") adjustments are excluded from adjusted income tax expense. Tax Reform includes a benefit, and any measurement period adjustments, from applying a lower U.S. federal income tax rate to the Company's net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017, offset in part by a one-time transition tax on historical foreign earnings and profits through December 31, 2017. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company’s performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted net income attributable to ABC: Adjusted net income attributable to ABC is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company's performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest: Adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interest excludes the non-controlling interest portion of acquisition-related intangibles amortization. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it facilitates the calculation of adjusted net income attributable to ABC. 

•Adjusted diluted earnings per share: Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the per share impact of adjustments including gain from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense (credit); PharMEDium remediation costs; costs (credit) related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act; acquisition-related intangibles amortization; employee severance, litigation, and other; and the loss on early retirement of debt; in each case net of the tax effect calculated using the applicable effective tax rate for those items. In addition, the per share impact of Tax Reform is excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the per share impact of the items that are outside the control of the Company or that we consider to not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature.

In addition, the Company has provided non-GAAP fiscal year 2019 guidance for diluted earnings per share, operating expense, operating income, and effective income tax rate that excludes the same or similar items as those that are excluded from the historical non-GAAP financial measures, as well as significant items that are outside the control of the Company or inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature. In addition, it has provided fiscal year 2019 adjusted free cash flow guidance. For fiscal year 2019, we have defined the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding other significant unpredictable or non-recurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. The Company does not provide forward looking guidance on a GAAP basis for such metrics because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. For example, LIFO expense (credit) is largely dependent upon the future inflation or deflation of brand and generic pharmaceuticals, which is out of the Company’s control, and acquisition-related intangibles amortization depends on the timing and amount of future acquisitions, which cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the timing and amount of litigation settlements is unpredictable and non-recurring.
