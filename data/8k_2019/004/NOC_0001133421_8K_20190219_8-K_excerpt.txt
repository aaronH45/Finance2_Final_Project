Item 8.01 Other Events. 

Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrop Grumman" or the "Company") has received notification of an unsolicited "mini-tender" offer by TRC Capital Corporation (TRC Capital) to purchase up to 500,000 shares, or approximately 0.29 percent of the outstanding common stock of the company as of January 28, 2019. TRC Capital's offer price of $274.25 per share in cash is approximately 4.44% less than the $286.98 closing price of the Company's common stock on February 15, 2019, the last trading day before the mini-tender offer commenced. 

The Company does not endorse TRC Capital's mini-tender offer and recommends that shareholders do not tender their shares in response to the offer. The offer is at a price below the current market price for Northrop Grumman shares and is subject to various conditions. 

The Company urges shareholders to obtain current market quotes for their shares, to review the conditions to TRC Capital's mini-tender offer, to consult with their brokers or financial advisors and to exercise caution with respect to this mini-tender offer. The Company is in no way associated with TRC Capital, the mini-tender offer or the offer documentation.

A copy of the Company's press release entitled "Northrop Grumman Recommends Shareholders Reject Mini-Tender Offer by TRC Capital Corporation" is filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
