At its meeting held on January 14, 2019, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of U.S. Bancorp (the “Company”) adopted the U.S. Bancorp Annual Executive Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan provides that the Committee can make awards of variable compensation to officers of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, based on the achievement of performance objectives. The Plan is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.  

At the same meeting, the Committee approved awards under the Plan to the Company’s named executive officers for 2019 performance (the “2019 Awards”). These officers will have the opportunity under the 2019 Awards to earn cash payments with target values as follows: Andrew Cecere, 265% of salary; Terrance R. Dolan, 150% of salary; Jeffry H. von Gillern, 150% of salary; and Gunjan Kedia, 150% of salary. The actual amounts earned will be determined based on achievement relative to a corporate earnings per share target for 2019 (weighted 50%) and business line pre-tax income targets for 2019 (weighted 35% for Mr. von Gillern and 50% for the others) and, for Mr. von Gillern only, expense performance (weighted 15%).
