 Item 5.02.  

Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

The Compensation Committee of the Jefferies Financial Group Inc. Board of Directors approved an executive compensation incentive bonus plan for fiscal year 2019 for the following executive officers:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Under the plan for Ms. Gendron and Mr. Sharp, each executive’s 2019 bonus will be partly performance-based and partly discretionary.  

Performance-based Bonus  

To be eligible to receive targeted performance-based bonus, Jefferies will have to achieve 9% Return on Tangible Deployable Equity (ROTDE) during the year ending November 30, 2019. ROTDE is net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets divided by tangible book value at the beginning of the year adjusted for intangible assets and deferred tax assets. ROTDE is the same performance metric historically used for executive bonuses.  

If Jefferies’ 2019 ROTDE is less than 6%, Ms. Gendron and Mr. Sharp will not receive any performance-based bonus. If Jefferies’ 2019 ROTDE equals 6%, Ms. Gendron and Mr. Sharp will be eligible to receive a performance-based bonus equal to $250,000 and $1,000,000, respectively. If Jefferies’ 2019 ROTDE equals 9% Ms. Gendron and Mr. Sharp will be eligible to receive a performance-based bonus equal to $500,000 and $2,000,000, respectively. If Jefferies’ 2019 ROTDE equals 12% or more, Ms. Gendron and Mr. Sharp will be eligible to receive a performance-based bonus equal to $750,000 and $3,000,000, respectively. 2019 ROTDE performance results falling between 6-12% will result in each executive being eligible to receive a performance-based bonus based on an interpolated basis.  

Discretionary-based Bonus  

Each executive will also be eligible to receive a discretionary bonus based on personal performance, effectiveness of non-revenue-generating activities, implementation of strategic initiatives and overall senior management skill and effectiveness.  

Performance and discretionary-based bonuses will be subject to Compensation Committee approval following fiscal year 2019.
