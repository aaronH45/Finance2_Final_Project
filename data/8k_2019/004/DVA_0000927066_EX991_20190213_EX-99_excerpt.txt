(1) For the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc., see the note titled “Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

Current items impacting operating income:

Advocacy costs: During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we incurred advocacy costs of $30 million and $93 million, respectively, in countering union policy efforts, including ballot initiatives. These costs are included in the U.S. dialysis and related lab services segment in general and administrative expenses.

Non-GAAP adjustments to operating income:

Gain on changes in ownership interest: During the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired a controlling interest in a previously nonconsolidated dialysis partnership. As a result of this transaction, we consolidated this partnership and recognized a non-cash gain of $28 million on our previously held ownership interest in this partnership.

Equity loss on impairments and changes in business ownership: During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a reduction in equity earnings of $2 million as a result of impairment charges recognized by our Asia Pacific joint venture (APAC JV). In addition, we recognized an equity investment loss of $9 million due to the APAC JV's sale of our India business.

Certain columns or rows may not sum or recalculate due to the use of rounded numbers.

Valuation adjustment on assets held for sale: On December 11, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the agreement to sell our DMG business that, among other things, reduced the purchase price from $4.9 billion to $4.34 billion. The closing of the transaction remains subject to receipt of required regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As a result of entering into this amendment, we recorded an additional charge of approximately $252 million on our DMG business which included a $219 million valuation adjustment, a $42 million goodwill impairment charge and $8 million in related tax benefit on this held-for-sale business.

Financial and operating metrics: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Volume: Total U.S. dialysis treatments for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 7,552,412, or 95,119 treatments per day, representing a per day increase of 3.1% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Normalized non-acquired treatment growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was 2.6%.

Effective income tax rate: Our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 20.0% and 24.6% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. These effective income tax rates are impacted by the amount of third party owners' income attributable to non-tax paying entities. The effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. was 24.3% and 29.2% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.

2

Our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was impacted by the net gain on business ownership changes, an equity investment loss on a business sale and impairment charges in the APAC JV. Excluding these items from the three months ended December 31, 2018, our effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. would have been 23.1%. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, our effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. remained 29.2%, as our net non-GAAP adjustments did not impact the rate for this period. Our effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. for the three months ended December 31, 2018 decreased from the three months ended September 30, 2018, due to the recognition of state tax and deferred year end true-ups.

Center activity: As of December 31, 2018, we provided dialysis services to a total of approximately 227,700 patients at 2,905 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,664 centers were located in the United States and 241 centers were located in 9 countries outside of the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we opened a total of 34 new dialysis centers, acquired 13 dialysis centers, closed two centers and sold one center in the United States. In addition, our international dialysis operations acquired 10 dialysis centers, developed two dialysis centers and sold 22 dialysis centers outside of the United States during the fourth quarter of 2018.

Outlook

The following forward-looking measures and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those described below, and actual results may vary significantly from these current forward-looking measures. We do not provide guidance for effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations on a GAAP basis nor a reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts. The guidance below does not include the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The guidance for effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. does not include the amount of third party owners' income and related taxes attributable to non-tax paying entities.

We will be holding a conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018, on February 14, 2019, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. To join the conference call, please dial (877) 918-6630 from the U.S. or (517) 308-9042 from outside the U.S., and provide the operator the password 'Earnings'.

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures

As used in this press release, the term “adjusted” refers to non-GAAP measures as follows, each as reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure as presented in the non-GAAP reconciliations in the notes to this press release: (i) for income measures, the term “adjusted” refers to operating performance measures that exclude certain items such as impairment charges, (gain) loss on ownership changes, restructuring charges, and gains and charges associated with settlements; and (ii) the term “effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc.” represents the Company’s effective tax rate excluding applicable non-GAAP items and noncontrolling owners’ income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities.

These non-GAAP or “adjusted” measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered alternatives to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. 

Specifically, we use adjusted operating income, adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. and adjusted diluted net income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita Inc. to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. We also believe these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. As a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normalized prior period results.

In addition, the effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities, and the effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income and certain non-deductible and other charges which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results. Accordingly, we believe these adjusted effective income tax rates are useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to DaVita Inc.

Finally, free cash flow from continuing operations represents net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions to noncontrolling interests and capital expenditures for routine maintenance and information technology from continuing operations. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to management, investors and analysts as an adjunct to cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations and other measures under GAAP, since free cash flow from continuing operations is meaningful for assessing our ability to fund acquisition and development activities and meet our debt service obligations. 

It is important to bear in mind that these non-GAAP "adjusted" measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, nor as substitutes for, their most comparable GAAP measures. 

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures presented herein to their most comparable GAAP measures are included at Notes 2, 3, 4 and 5 at the end of this press release.

•continued increased competition from dialysis providers and others, and other potential marketplace changes;

•our ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance, including our ability to achieve anticipated savings from our recent restructurings;

5

reimbursement rates, such as accountable care organizations, independent practice associations and integrated delivery systems;

•our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might announce or be considering, on terms favorable to us or at all, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, or to successfully expand our operations and services in markets outside the United States, or to businesses outside of dialysis;

•noncompliance by us or our business associates with any privacy laws or any security breach by us or a third party involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information;

Note 1: Calculation of the Leverage Ratio

Under the senior secured credit facilities (Credit Agreement), the leverage ratio is defined as all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued, minus cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments, divided by “Consolidated EBITDA”. The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its Term Loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following leverage ratio was calculated using “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined in the Credit Agreement. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of “Consolidated EBITDA”, pro forma for routine acquisitions that occurred during the period. The Company’s management believes the presentation of “Consolidated EBITDA” is useful to users to enhance their understanding of the Company’s leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement. The leverage ratio calculated by the Company is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a substitute for debt to net income attributable to DaVita Inc., net income attributable to DaVita Inc. or total debt as determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company’s calculation of its leverage ratio might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In accordance with the Credit Agreement, the Company’s leverage ratio cannot exceed 5.00 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2018. At that date the Company’s leverage ratio did not exceed 5.00 to 1.00.
