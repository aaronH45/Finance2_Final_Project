While the Company has provided an outlook for local currency sales growth and Adjusted EPS, it has not provided an outlook for reported sales growth or EPS as it would require an estimate of currency exchange fluctuations and non-recurring items, which are not yet known. The Company noted in making its outlook that economic uncertainty remains in certain regions of the world and market conditions are subject to change. 

Conclusion 

Filliol concluded, "We ended 2018 on a positive note as demand in our markets remains solid and our growth initiatives continue to yield strong results. We are cautious on the global economy as uncertainties exist, particularly concerning trade tariff disputes. We will continue to monitor developments closely and adapt our plans if economic conditions change. We assume market conditions will remain favorable and are confident in our ability to execute on our growth initiatives. With the benefit of our investments in our field force, Spinnaker sales and marketing programs and new product launches, we believe we are well positioned to continue to gain market share. With the positive impact from margin and productivity initiatives and, despite headwinds due to currency and tariffs, we believe we can deliver strong results in 2019."
