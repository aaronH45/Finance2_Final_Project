Chubb Limited News Release  

ZURICH – February 5, 2019 – Chubb Limited (NYSE: CB) today reported net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 of $355 million, or $0.76 per share, compared with $1,533 million, or $3.27 per share, for the same quarter last year. Core operating income was $935 million, or $2.02 per share, compared with $1,489 million, or $3.17 per share, for the same quarter last year. The property and casualty (P&C) combined ratio was 93.1%. Book and tangible book value per share decreased 0.8% and 1.4%, respectively, from September 30, 2018 and now stand at $109.56 and $65.89, respectively. Book and tangible book value per share were unfavorably impacted by net realized and unrealized losses of $383 million after-tax in the company’s investment portfolio, primarily reflecting the widening of credit spreads on corporate fixed income securities late in the quarter, partially offset by the decline in interest rates.

Full Year Summary  

(in millions of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)  

(Unaudited)  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the tax expenses (benefits) related to the table above were $(12) million and $(93) million, respectively, for Chubb integration expenses; $(40) million and $(85) million, respectively, for amortization of fair value adjustment of acquired invested assets and long-term debt; $5 million for adjusted net realized gains and losses for both periods; and $742 million and $34 million, respectively, for core operating income.  

Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chubb Limited, commented: “Chubb performed well in a quarter marked by elevated natural catastrophe losses, on the one hand, and stronger premium revenue growth, improved commercial P&C pricing globally and record net investment income, on the other. Core operating income was $935 million compared with $1.5 billion prior year, which included a one-time tax benefit and lighter CAT activity. Our P&C combined ratio of 93.1% included 8.5 points of pre-tax CAT losses.  

“P&C net premiums written in the quarter grew nearly 6% in constant dollars, driven by our growth initiatives and improved pricing in the U.S., London and a number of other markets around the world. In North America, commercial P&C premiums grew about 5%, while in our international operations premiums were up 8% in constant dollars. Globally, this was our best quarter of the year – and for some of our businesses the best in several years – in terms of the pace and broad-based nature of price change and improved underwriting conditions.  

“Benefiting from higher reinvestment rates and our strong cash flow, adjusted pre-tax net investment income in the quarter was $903 million, up about 3.5%, and contributed to investment income of $3.6 billion for the year – both records.  

“Looking at our 12-month results, a more meaningful perspective given the natural quarter-to-quarter volatility of the risk business, we completed a very good year with core operating income of $4.4 billion, or $9.44 per share, up 18% on a per share basis from ‘17. Net premiums written grew 4.5%. The full-year P&C combined ratio was 90.6%, compared to 94.7% prior year, and that’s with $1.6 billion of CAT losses – about  

 Chubb®, Chubb logo® and Chubb. Insured.SM are trademarks of Chubb.   3 

Chubb Limited News Release  

$700 million more than we expected. The current accident year combined ratio excluding CATs was 88% versus 87.6% prior year.  

“Our earnings led to a core operating ROE of 8.7%, or 9.8% with an expected level of catastrophe losses. Book and tangible book value per share growth were impacted last year by the mark-to-market effect of rising interest rates on the investment portfolio, which will amortize away over a reasonably short period of time. Book value per share was down about 0.5% while tangible book value per share growth was flat; excluding the mark, they grew 2.7% and 5.8%, respectively.  

“We have good momentum as we execute on our business initiatives across the globe and take advantage of an improving price and underwriting environment that the industry needs. Our organization is optimistic about the year ahead and we are off to a good start.”

Chubb Limited News Release  

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In presenting our results, we included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  

Throughout this document there are various measures presented on a constant-dollar basis (i.e., excludes the impact of foreign exchange). We believe it is useful to evaluate the trends in our results exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted, as these exchange rates could fluctuate significantly between periods and distort the analysis of trends. The impact is determined by assuming constant foreign exchange rates between periods by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period.  

Adjusted net investment income is net investment income excluding the amortization of the fair value adjustment on acquired invested assets of $55 million in Q4 2018 and $248 million for full-year 2018. We believe this measure is meaningful as it highlights the underlying performance of our invested assets and portfolio management in support of our lines of business.  

Adjusted net realized gains (losses), net of tax, includes net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) recorded in other income (expense) related to unconsolidated subsidiaries, and excludes realized gains and losses on crop derivatives. These derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. We view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations, and therefore realized gains (losses) from these derivatives are reclassified to adjusted losses and loss expenses. The P&C combined ratio includes adjusted losses and loss expenses in the ratio numerator.  

Underwriting income, P&C underwriting income and Global P&C underwriting income are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. P&C underwriting income also includes gains (losses) on crop derivatives. We use underwriting income and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including adjusted net investment income, other income (expense), interest and income tax expense and adjusted net realized gains (losses).   

Current accident year underwriting income excluding catastrophe losses is underwriting income adjusted to exclude catastrophe losses and prior period development (PPD). We believe it is useful to exclude catastrophe losses, as they are not predictable as to timing and amount, and PPD as these unexpected loss developments on historical reserves are not indicative of our current underwriting performance. We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.  

Segment income (loss) includes underwriting income, adjusted net investment income, other income (expense) – operating, and amortization expense of purchased intangibles.  

Core operating income, net of tax, excludes adjusted net realized gains (losses), Chubb integration expenses, and the amortization of the fair value adjustments of acquired debt and invested assets related to the Chubb Corp acquisition. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude adjusted net realized gains (losses) because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by the availability of market opportunities. We also exclude Chubb integration expenses  

 Chubb®, Chubb logo® and Chubb. Insured.SM are trademarks of Chubb.   10 

Chubb Limited News Release  

related to the acquisition due to the size, complexity, and volume of this acquisition, which may not be indicative of such future costs. We believe that excluding the Chubb integration expenses facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results. References to core operating income measures mean net of tax, whether or not noted. Core operating effective tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure which provides the effective tax rate on our core operating income.  

P&C combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss expense ratio, acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio excluding the life business and including the realized gains and losses on the crop derivatives.  

Current accident year P&C combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses excludes the impact of catastrophe losses and PPD. We believe this measure provides a better evaluation of our underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our property and casualty business that may be obscured by these items.  

Global P&C performance metrics comprise consolidated operating results (including corporate) and exclude the operating results of the company’s Life Insurance and North America Agricultural Insurance segments. We believe that these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company’s global P&C operations which are the most economically similar. We exclude the North America Agricultural Insurance and Life Insurance segments because the results of these businesses do not always correlate with the results of our global P&C operations.  

Life Insurance gross and net premiums written measures includes deposits collected on universal life and investment contracts (life deposits). Life deposits are not reflected as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations in accordance with GAAP. However, we include life deposits in presenting growth in our life insurance business because new life deposits are an important component of production and key to our efforts to grow our business.  

Core operating return on equity (ROE) or ROE calculated using core operating income are annualized financial measures. The ROE numerator includes income adjusted to exclude after-tax adjusted net realized gains (losses), Chubb integration expenses, and the amortization of the fair value adjustment of acquired invested assets and long-term debt. The ROE denominator includes the average shareholders’ equity for the period adjusted to exclude unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Core operating ROE is a useful measure as it enhances the understanding of the return on shareholders’ equity by highlighting the underlying profitability relative to shareholders’ equity excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments.  

Tangible book value per common share, net of tax, is shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets divided by the shares outstanding. We believe that goodwill and other intangible assets are not indicative of our underlying insurance results or trends and make book value comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies less meaningful. In addition, we disclose per share measures for book value and tangible book value that exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in order to adjust for the distortive effects of fluctuations in exchange rates.   

Book and tangible book value per share excluding unrealized investment gains (losses) does not include unrealized gains (losses) on investments because they are heavily influenced by changes in market conditions, including interest rate changes. We believe these measures are meaningful to understanding growth in book and tangible book value by highlighting the underlying profitability relative to shareholders’ equity excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments.  

Other income (expense) – operating excludes from consolidated Other income (expense) the portion of net realized gains and losses related to unconsolidated entities and gains and losses from fair value changes in separate account assets that  

 Chubb®, Chubb logo® and Chubb. Insured.SM are trademarks of Chubb.   11 

Chubb Limited News Release  

do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP. Net realized gains (losses) related to unconsolidated entities is excluded from core operating income in order to enhance the understanding of our results of underwriting operations as they are heavily influenced by, and fluctuate in part according to, market conditions.  

Chubb integration expenses include all internal and external costs directly related to the integration activities of the Chubb Corp acquisition, consisting primarily of personnel-related expenses, including severance and employee retention and relocation; consulting fees; and advisor fees.  

See the reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 31-37 in the Financial Supplement. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP, including premium, net income, return on equity, net investment income, and effective tax rate.
