Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On February 5, 2019, the Compensation Committee (“Committee”) of the Board of Trustees of Federal Realty Investment Trust (“Trust”) approved the following compensation arrangements for the Trust’s named executive officers: (a) increases in base salaries effective as of January 1, 2019 for Dawn M. Becker, the Trust’s Executive Vice President-General Counsel and Secretary to $475,000 and for Daniel Guglielmone, the Trust’s Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer to $500,000; (b) a supplemental cash bonus of $50,000 to each of Ms. Becker and Mr. Guglielmone; and (c) payouts at 100% of target to each of Mr. Donald C. Wood, the Trust’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Guglielmone and Ms. Becker under the Trust’s long-term incentive award program (“LTIAP”) which represents an exercise of the Committee’s discretion under the LTIAP to increase the award. Without the exercise of the Committee’s discretion, the awards for Mr. Wood and Ms. Becker, based on the performance goals set by the Committee for 2018, would have been paid at 90% of target and the award for Mr. Guglielmone would have been paid at 85% of target.
