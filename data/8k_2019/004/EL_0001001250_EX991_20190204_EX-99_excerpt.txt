Net Sales Increased 7% and Diluted EPS increased to $1.55 

Net Sales Increased 11% and Adjusted Diluted EPS Rose 25% in Constant Currency  

Before Impact of New Revenue Accounting Standard 

Company Raises Full Year Guidance 

New York, February 5, 2019 - The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE: EL) today reported outstanding financial results for its second quarter ended December 31, 2018. The Company’s quarterly net sales exceeded $4 billion for the first time. Net sales of $4.01 billion increased 7% from $3.74 billion in the prior-year quarter. The Company posted net sales growth in nearly all product categories, geographic regions and channels. Excluding the impact of currency translation and the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard (“ASC 606”), net sales increased 11%. 

Net earnings rose to $573 million compared with $123 million last year. Diluted net earnings per common share increased to $1.55 compared with $.33 reported in the prior year. Before the $.11 impact of ASC 606, adjusted diluted earnings per common share, which excludes items detailed on page 2, were $1.86, up 22%, or 25% in constant currency. 

Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We delivered an excellent performance in our fiscal second quarter. Importantly, this was our eighth consecutive quarter of impressive net sales growth that met or exceeded our long-term goal, all while navigating many global macro issues. Our sustained progress is the result of our multiple engines of growth strategy, and demonstrates our agility in moving resources to the best global opportunities. Our earnings per share in the second quarter grew more than twice the rate of net sales in constant currency, delivering an impressive first-half performance. 

     Page 1 of 20    

With confidence in our continued ability to execute effectively and grow share in prestige beauty, while simultaneously making strategic investments in our business, we are raising our net sales and EPS guidance for the year. 

“Our strongest growth engines this quarter included the skin care category globally, the Asia/Pacific region, the online and travel retail channels, and most brands, including Estée Lauder, La Mer, M·A·C and our artisanal fragrance brands.” 

Freda added, “Despite a volatile and challenging backdrop, we are optimistic about our Company’s long-term outlook. We are very well-positioned to build share in global prestige beauty. Leveraging savings generated by our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, we plan to increase our investments during the next six months behind our successful innovations, high-quality products, compelling digital advertising and effective commercial execution, while also enhancing our capabilities to strengthen our industry leadership and deliver long-term profitable growth.” 

Adjusted diluted earnings per common share excludes restructuring and other charges, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, changes in contingent consideration and the finalization of provisional charges for the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) as detailed in the following table.

Net sales and operating income in the Company’s product categories and regions outside of the United States were unfavorably impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies. Total reported operating income was $771 million, a 9% increase from $710 million in the prior year. Operating income increased 18% excluding (1) the unfavorable impact of currency translation of $24 million, (2) the adoption of ASC 606 that reduced operating income by $54 million, (3) restructuring and other charges of $35 million compared to $69 million in the prior-year period, and (4) goodwill and other intangible asset impairments related to Smashbox of $38 million. The improvement in operating income largely reflected higher net sales and disciplined expense management throughout the business. 

Results by Product Category 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The change in total net sales was unfavorably impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, as previously mentioned. Adjusting for the impact of ASC 606, total net sales in constant currency increased 11% and reported operating income increased 16%. 

Skin Care 

· The adoption of ASC 606 reduced reported net sales growth by $48 million, or 3%, and reduced operating income growth by $33 million, or 7%. 

· Skin care net sales grew across most geographies, channels and brands, particularly Estée Lauder, La Mer and Origins. Clinique’s skin care net sales also grew globally in constant currency. 

· The Estée Lauder brand delivered net sales growth in every region and most channels. The double-digit increase reflected continued strength in its existing product franchises, supported by successful innovation such as Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex. 

     Page 3 of 20    

· Double-digit growth at La Mer was also broad-based, with net sales increasing across regions and channels, driven by higher net sales of existing products. Additionally, incremental net sales from new product launches, including The Treatment Lotion Hydrating Mask and The Luminous Lifting Cushion Foundation also contributed to La Mer’s growth. 

· Operating income increased sharply, reflecting higher net sales, primarily at Estée Lauder and La Mer. 

Makeup 

· The adoption of ASC 606 reduced reported net sales growth by $14 million, or 1%, and reduced operating income growth by $18 million, or 8%. 

· Growth in makeup was primarily driven by strong increases from Estée Lauder, M·A·C, Tom Ford Beauty and BECCA. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales from Clinique and Smashbox. 

· Estée Lauder generated solid double-digit growth, driven by strength from its Double Wear line of products. 

· M·A·C’s strong performance was led by double-digit growth across Asia/Pacific, the Middle East, including Turkey, and Italy. 

· Net sales from Tom Ford Beauty increased double-digits, primarily driven by its lip color and eye shadow franchises. 

· BECCA’s growth was largely driven by the BFF Collection and the Ultimate Lipstick Love new product launches. 

· Makeup operating income declined, reflecting planned investments at Too Faced to support new and existing products, as well as international expansion. Lower makeup net sales from Clinique and Smashbox also contributed to the decline, as did $38 million of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments related to Smashbox. This decline was partially offset by increases at Estée Lauder, Tom Ford Beauty and M·A·C, primarily due to higher net sales. 

Fragrance 

· The adoption of ASC 606 reduced reported net sales growth by $9 million, or 2%, and reduced operating income by $5 million, or 5%. 

· The net sales decrease reflected a change in promotional strategy for holiday by Estée Lauder and lower net sales of certain designer fragrances. The decreases were mostly offset by growth from our luxury and artisanal fragrances, including Jo Malone London, Le Labo, Tom Ford Beauty and By Kilian. 

· Jo Malone London’s net sales increase primarily reflected the launch of holiday collections and expanded targeted consumer reach. 

· Increased net sales from Le Labo, Tom Ford Beauty and By Kilian reflected expanded targeted consumer reach and new product launches. 

· Fragrance operating income declined in line with net sales. 

     Page 4 of 20    

Hair Care 

· Hair care net sales increased, primarily reflecting higher net sales from Aveda, due to continued growth from recent launches and online. 

· Hair care operating income declined, as higher net sales from Aveda were offset by strategic advertising investments to support product launches, digital outreach and the brand’s innovative social media and digital campaign activity. 

Results by Geographic Region 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The change in total net sales was unfavorably impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, as previously mentioned. Adjusting for the impact of ASC 606, total net sales in constant currency increased 11% and reported operating income increased 16%. 

The Americas 

· The adoption of ASC 606 reduced reported net sales growth by $39 million, or 3%, and reduced operating income by $21 million. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation reduced reported net sales by 1%. 

· Net sales in The Americas region declined 3%, excluding the impacts from the adoption of ASC 606 and currency translation. 

· This was the final full quarter of net sales to Bon Ton in the prior year. 

· Net sales grew double-digits in online and single digits in specialty-multi in North America. 

· Operating income in The Americas decreased, primarily reflecting lower sales, the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to Smashbox and investments in technology. 

Europe, the Middle East & Africa 

· The adoption of ASC 606 decreased reported net sales growth by $4 million, or less than 1%, and decreased operating income growth by $7 million, or 2%. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation reduced reported net sales growth by 3%. 

     Page 5 of 20    

· The Company generated strong net sales growth in the region, both on a reported basis and in constant currency, primarily due to strong double-digit net sales growth in travel retail, and the Middle East, including Turkey. Net sales in Russia also grew double-digits, in constant currency. This growth was partially offset by slightly lower net sales in the United Kingdom. 

· The emerging markets in the region were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, the net sales in most of the countries reflected strong growth and two-thirds of them delivered double-digit increases. The Middle East growth was primarily driven by M·A·C. 

· In travel retail, strong double-digit net sales growth was broad-based across brands, led by Estée Lauder, La Mer, M·A·C, Tom Ford and Origins. Growth was also realized across many geographies and reflected increases in international passenger traffic, improved conversion, successful innovation and expanded targeted consumer reach. 

· Net sales performance in the United Kingdom reflected reduced consumer confidence ahead of Brexit, House of Fraser door closures and lower traffic across brick-and-mortar stores that was mostly offset by higher online net sales. 

· Operating income increased, primarily due to strong double-digit growth in travel retail and, to a lesser extent, many countries throughout the region, partially offset by lower results in the United Kingdom. 

Asia/Pacific 

· The adoption of ASC 606 reduced reported net sales growth by $24 million, or 3%, and reduced operating income growth by $26 million, or 12%. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation reduced reported net sales by 3%. 

· The Company delivered another quarter of strong double-digit net sales increases in Asia/Pacific, both on a reported basis and in constant currency. The growth was broad-based, with nearly half of the markets in the region growing double digits. 

· China, Hong Kong and Japan continued to deliver strong growth, and Korea net sales accelerated. Prestige beauty in China accelerated and the Company continued to build share. 

· The Company generated double-digit net sales growth in virtually every major product category and channel. 

· Operating income increased, primarily due to higher net sales. 

Six-Month Results 

· For the six months ended December 31, 2018, the Company reported net sales of $7.53 billion, a 7% increase compared with $7.02 billion in the prior-year period. 

· Net earnings were $1.07 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $2.88. In the prior-year six months, the Company reported net earnings of $550 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.46. 

     Page 6 of 20    

· During the six-months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments and changes in contingent consideration combined of $111 million ($94 million after tax), equal to $.25 per diluted share. The prior-year period results include restructuring and other charges and changes in contingent consideration combined of $110 million ($83 million after tax), equal to $.22 per share, as detailed in the table on page 15. 

· Adjusting for restructuring and other charges and adjustments, diluted net earnings per common share for the six months ended December 31, 2018 was $3.15, and in constant currency rose 18%. For the six months ended December 31, 2018, the negative impact of foreign currency translation on diluted net earnings per common share was $.07. 

· The adoption of ASC 606 reduced reported net sales growth by $134 million, or 2%, decreased operating income growth by $85 million, or 7%, and decreased diluted earnings per share by $.18 or 7%. 

· Adjusting for restructuring and other charges and adjustments, and excluding the impact of currency translation and the adoption of ASC 606, net sales increased 11% and diluted earnings per share rose 25%. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

· For the six months ended December 31, 2018, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1.27 billion, compared with $1.44 billion in the prior year. 

· The decline primarily reflected higher international inventory levels to support our growth and timing of payables and receivables that was mostly offset by an increase in earnings before taxes. 

Outlook for Fiscal 2019 Third Quarter and Full Year 

The Company continues to see strong consumer demand for its high-quality products and expects to continue to deliver growth at the high end of its long-term net sales and earnings per share growth targets. We continue to expect global prestige beauty to grow 5% to 6% during the fiscal year. The Company expects to grow ahead of the industry. However, the Company is mindful of risks related to social and political issues, including the government shutdown in the United States, geopolitical tensions, regulatory matters, global security issues, currency volatility and economic challenges that could affect consumer spending in certain countries and travel corridors. 

Given this environment, the Company has reflected the following risks in its outlook: 

· Future moderation of net sales growth in China and Travel Retail, which we have not experienced to date, to reflect current geopolitical and economic risks. 

· Impact of the planned tariff increase in China in March. 

· Announced closings of certain department store locations in the United States and the United Kingdom. 

· Some costs associated with the upcoming anticipated Brexit in the United Kingdom.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 

Sales Outlook 

· Reported net sales are forecasted to increase between 5% and 6% versus the prior-year period, including a 5% impact from currency translation and a 2% benefit from the adoption of ASC 606. Excluding these items, net sales are expected to grow between 8% and 9%. 

Earnings per Share Outlook 

· Reported diluted net earnings per common share are projected to be between $1.17 and $1.20. Excluding restructuring and other charges and adjustments, diluted net earnings per common share are projected to be between $1.26 and $1.28. 

· The adoption of ASC 606 is expected to increase diluted net earnings per common share by approximately $.18, reflecting the cumulative impact of revenue deferrals in the first half of the fiscal year that we expect to be recognized in net sales in the second half of the fiscal year. 

· Currency exchange rates are volatile and uncertain. Using the December 31, 2018 spot rate, the negative currency impact equates to about $.09 of diluted earnings per common share. 

· On a constant currency basis, before restructuring and other charges and adjustments, as well as the impact from the adoption of ASC 606, diluted earnings per common share are expected to increase between 1% and 2%, which includes investments behind strong innovation programs for some of our largest brands and to build capabilities for long-term growth. 

· The Company expects to take charges associated with Leading Beauty Forward of approximately $40 million to $45 million, equal to $.08 to $.09 per diluted common share. 

Full Year Fiscal 2019 

Sales Outlook 

· Reported net sales are forecasted to increase between 5% and 6% versus the prior-year period, which includes a 3% impact from currency translation and no impact from the adoption of ASC 606. Excluding these items, net sales are forecasted to grow between 8% and 9%, above the Company’s long-term growth goal of 6% to 8%. 

Earnings per Share Outlook 

· Reported diluted net earnings per common share are projected to be between $4.55 and $4.67. Excluding restructuring and other charges and adjustments, diluted net earnings per common share are projected to be between $4.92 and $5.00. 

· The adoption of ASC 606 is expected to reduce diluted net earnings per common share by approximately $.01. 

· Currency exchange rates are volatile and uncertain. Using the December 31, 2018 spot rate for the remaining quarters of fiscal 2019, the negative currency impact equates to about $.22 of diluted earnings per common share. 

     Page 8 of 20    

· On a constant currency basis, before restructuring and other charges and adjustments, as well as the impact of ASC 606, diluted earnings per common share are expected to increase between 14% and 16%. This is well ahead of the Company’s long-term goal of double-digit earnings per common share growth in constant currency. This growth is well ahead of sales growth even while investing during the second half of the year behind strong product innovation programs for some of our largest brands and to build capabilities for long-term growth. 

· The Company expects to take charges associated with previously approved restructuring and other activities relating to Leading Beauty Forward in fiscal 2019 of approximately $155 million to $170 million, equal to $.33 to $.37 per diluted common share. 

· For the full fiscal year, the Company expects the global effective tax rate to be approximately 22%, before charges associated with the restructuring and other charges and adjustments.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(A) In May 2016, the Company announced a multi-year initiative (Leading Beauty Forward) to build on its strengths and better leverage its cost structure to free resources for investment to continue its growth momentum. Leading Beauty Forward is designed to enhance the Company’s go-to-market capabilities, reinforce its leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value. During fiscal 2019, the Company continued to approve specific initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward. The Company plans to approve additional initiatives through fiscal 2019 and expects to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021. Inclusive of approvals from inception through December 31, 2018, we estimate that Leading Beauty Forward may result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $900 million and $950 million, before taxes. Once fully implemented, Leading Beauty Forward is expected to yield annual net benefits of between $350 million and $450 million, before taxes. These savings can be used to improve margin, mitigate risk and invest in future growth initiatives. 

(B) The Company recorded $2 million of expense and $9 million of income within selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively to reflect changes  

     Page 13 of 20    

in the fair value of its contingent consideration related to certain of its fiscal 2015 and 2016 acquisitions. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded charges of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, of such expense. 

(C) In December 2018, the Company recorded goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of $38 million ($34 million after tax), or $.09 per diluted share, related to its Smashbox reporting unit. Smashbox made revisions to its internal forecasts reflecting a slowdown of its makeup business driven by increased competitive activity and lower than expected growth in key retail channels for the brand. 

(D) During the three months and six months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net charge of $6 million and $5 million, respectively, equal to $.02 per common share to reflect the finalization of the provisional amounts for the impact of the TCJA. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded provisional charges for the impact of the TCJA totaling $394 million, equal to $1.05 per common share.

Results by Product Category 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The change in total net sales was unfavorably impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, as previously mentioned. Adjusting for the impact of ASC 606, total net sales in constant currency increased 11% and reported operating income increased 21%. 

This earnings release includes some non-GAAP financial measures relating to charges associated with restructuring and other activities, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, the Transition Tax, the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets as of the TCJA enactment date and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings resulting from the TCJA. The following is a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measures for certain consolidated statements of earnings accounts before and after these items. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate its operating performance, which represent the manner in which the Company conducts and views its business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or do not reflect the Company’s underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze operating performance from period to period. In the future, the Company expects to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below; however, the impact to the Company’s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be 

     Page 16 of 20    

comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies. While the Company considers the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. 

The Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of its net sales generated outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the Company’s results of operations. Therefore, the Company presents certain net sales, operating results and diluted earnings per share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of its underlying business outside the United States. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current-period results using prior-year period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. Beginning in fiscal 2019, the Company adopted a new accounting standard related to hedging that resulted in gains/losses on its foreign currency cash flow hedging activities to now be reflected in Net Sales, where in prior periods they were reflected in Cost of Sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses. To better assess its performance in a constant currency environment, beginning in fiscal 2019 the Company is excluding the impact of these hedging activities in its constant currency calculations.
