Financial results reported in this document are preliminary.

1 Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling

interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with

certain of our nonmarketable equity securities but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The

methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on

average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables

investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding

reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the “Tangible Common Equity” tables on page 36.

SAN FRANCISCO – Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported net income of $6.1 billion, or $1.21 per diluted common share, for fourth quarter 2018, compared with $6.2 billion, or $1.16 per share, for fourth quarter 2017, and $6.0 billion, or $1.13 per share, for third quarter 2018. 

Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said, “I’m proud of the transformational changes we made at Wells Fargo during 2018 including significant progress on our six goals. We have made meaningful improvements to how we manage risk across the company, particularly operational and compliance risk. We improved customer service which resulted in both ‘Customer Loyalty’ and ‘Overall Satisfaction with Most Recent Visit’ branch survey scores reaching a 24-month high in December. Our voluntary team member attrition in 2018 improved to its lowest level in six years reflecting our efforts to make Wells Fargo a better place to work, and we continue to attract impressive leaders from outside the company. We launched many customer-focused innovations including our online mortgage application, Control TowerSM, Pay with Wells Fargo, and our new Propel® Card. Our commitment to building stronger communities was demonstrated by exceeding our target of donating $400 million to communities across the U.S., and a recent example was our Holiday Food Bank program which provided over 50 million meals during the holidays. Our focus on delivering long-term shareholder value included meeting our 2018 expense target and returning a record $25.8 billion to shareholders in 2018, up 78% from 2017. I want to thank our team members for their commitment to making Wells Fargo a better bank in 2018. I’m confident that we’ll continue to make Wells Fargo even better in 2019.”

Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said, “Wells Fargo reported $6.1 billion of net income in the fourth quarter. Compared with the third quarter, we grew both loans and deposits and credit

performance remained strong. In addition, our effective income tax rate was lower compared with the prior quarter, and we maintained solid capital levels even as we reduced our common shares outstanding. We continued to have positive business trends in the fourth quarter with primary consumer checking customers, consumer credit card active accounts, debit and credit card usage, commercial loan balances, and loan originations in auto, small business, home equity and student lending all growing compared with a year ago. Our focus on reducing expenses enabled us to meet our 2018 expense target, and we are on track to meet our 2019 expense target as well.” 

Net Interest Income

Net interest income in the fourth quarter was $12.6 billion, up $72 million from third quarter 2018, driven primarily by the benefits of higher average interest rates and favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, partially offset by the impacts from balance sheet mix and lower variable income. Net interest margin was 2.94 percent, flat compared with the prior quarter. 

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $8.3 billion, down $1.0 billion from third quarter 2018. Fourth quarter noninterest income included lower market sensitive revenue3, mortgage banking fees and trust and investment fees, partially offset by higher other income.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter declined $424 million from the prior quarter to $13.3 billion, predominantly due to a $671 million decline in employee benefits driven by lower

deferred compensation expense (largely offset in market sensitive revenue), lower FDIC expense due to the completion of their special assessment, and lower operating losses. These decreases were partially offset by higher other expense, operating lease expense on lease asset impairment, outside professional services and salary expense. The efficiency ratio was 63.6 percent in fourth quarter 2018, compared with 62.7 percent in the third quarter.

Fourth quarter 2018 operating losses were $432 million and included a $175 million accrual for an agreement reached in December 2018 with all 50 state Attorneys General and the District of Columbia regarding previously disclosed matters.

Income Taxes

The Company’s effective income tax rate was 13.7 percent for fourth quarter 2018, compared with 20.1 percent for third quarter 2018, which included net discrete income tax expense in the third quarter related to re-measurement of our initial estimates for the impacts of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (Tax Act) recognized in fourth quarter 2017. The fourth quarter 2018 income tax rate included $158 million of net discrete income tax benefits primarily related to the results of state income tax audits and incremental state tax credits. In addition, the fourth quarter income tax rate benefited from $137 million related to revisions to our full year 2018 effective income tax rate made during the quarter. The Company's full year 2018 effective income tax rate was 20.2 percent (18 percent before discrete items). We currently expect the effective income tax rate for full year 2019 to be approximately 18 percent, excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items.

Loans

Total average loans were $946.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up $6.9 billion from the third quarter. Period-end loan balances were $953.1 billion at December 31, 2018, up $10.8 billion from September 30, 2018. Commercial loans were up $11.5 billion compared with September 30, 2018, due to $12.2 billion of growth in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by a $583 million decline in commercial real estate loans. Consumer loans decreased $709 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the following:

•Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans increased $792 million, as $9.8 billion of held-for-investment nonconforming mortgage loan originations were predominantly offset by payoffs and $1.6 billion of sales of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) Pick-a-Pay mortgage loans. Additionally, $562 million of nonconforming mortgage loan originations that would have otherwise been included in 1-4 family first mortgage loan outstandings were designated as held-for-sale in fourth quarter 2018 in anticipation of the future issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).

•Real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage loans decreased $932 million, as payoffs continued to exceed originations

•Credit card loans increased $1.2 billion primarily due to seasonality

•Automobile loans declined $1.0 billion due to expected continued runoff

Period-End Loan Balances

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Debt and Equity Securities

Debt securities include available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, as well as debt securities held for trading. Debt securities were $484.7 billion at December 31, 2018, up $12.4 billion from the third quarter, predominantly due to a net increase in available-for-sale and held for trading debt securities. Debt securities purchases of approximately $16.9 billion, primarily U.S. Treasury and federal agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the available-for-sale portfolio, more than offset runoff and sales.

Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $2.6 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with net unrealized losses of $3.8 billion at September 30, 2018, predominantly due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher credit spreads.

Equity securities include marketable and non-marketable equity securities, as well as equity securities held for trading. Equity securities were $55.1 billion at December 31, 2018, down $6.6 billion from the third quarter, predominantly due to a decrease in equity securities held for trading.

Deposits

Total average deposits for fourth quarter 2018 were $1.3 trillion, up $2.6 billion from the prior quarter as growth in commercial deposits was partially offset by lower consumer and small business banking deposits, which included $1.8 billion of deposits associated with the previously announced sale of 52 branches that closed on November 30. The average deposit cost for fourth quarter 2018 was 55 basis points, up 8 basis points from the prior quarter and 27 basis points from a year ago.

Capital

Capital in the fourth quarter continued to exceed our internal target, with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (fully phased-in) of 11.7 percent5, down from 11.9 percent in the prior quarter. In fourth quarter 2018, the Company repurchased 142.7 million shares of its common stock, which net of issuances, reduced period-end common shares outstanding by 130.3 million. The Company paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.43 per share.

preliminary estimate and is calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules.

Credit Quality 

Net Loan Charge-offs

The quarterly loss rate in the fourth quarter was 0.30 percent (annualized), compared with 0.29 percent in the prior quarter and 0.31 percent a year ago. Commercial and consumer losses were 0.10 percent and 0.53 percent, respectively. Total credit losses were $721 million in fourth quarter 2018, up $41 million from third quarter 2018. Commercial losses decreased $20 million driven by lower commercial and industrial loan net charge-offs and higher recoveries in commercial real estate, while consumer losses increased $61 million predominantly driven by seasonal increases in credit card and other revolving credit and installment loan charge-offs.

Net Loan Charge-Offs

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets decreased $289 million, or 4 percent, from third quarter 2018 to $6.9 billion. Nonaccrual loans decreased $218 million from third quarter 2018 to $6.5 billion reflecting both lower consumer and commercial nonaccruals.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $10.7 billion at December 31, 2018, down $249 million from September 30, 2018. Fourth quarter 2018 included a $200 million reserve release2, which reflected continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.12 percent, compared with 1.16 percent in third quarter 2018. The allowance covered 3.7 times annualized fourth quarter net charge-offs, compared with 4.1 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage for nonaccrual loans was 165 percent at December 31, 2018, compared with 163 percent at September 30, 2018.

This document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and our management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our expectations regarding future loan losses and allowance levels; (iv) the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses; (v) our expectations regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (vi) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vii) future capital or liquidity levels or targets and our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III capital standards; (viii) the performance of our mortgage business and any related exposures; (ix) the expected outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance therewith; (x) future common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of capital; (xi) our targeted range for return on assets, return on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xii) the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; and (xiii) the Company’s plans, objectives and strategies.

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: 

•current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth;

•our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;

•financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services;

•the extent of our success in our loan modification efforts, as well as the effects of regulatory requirements or guidance regarding loan modifications;

•the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we receive and our ability to satisfy any such demands without having to repurchase loans related thereto or otherwise indemnify or reimburse third parties, and the credit quality of or losses on such repurchased mortgage loans;

•negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices, as well as changes in industry standards or practices, regulatory or judicial requirements, penalties or fines, increased servicing and other costs or obligations, including loan modification requirements, or delays or moratoriums on foreclosures;

•our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or

acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters;

•the effect of the current interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgage loans held for sale;

•significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things, reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and declines in asset values and/or recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our debt securities and equity securities portfolios;

•the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses;

•negative effects from the retail banking sales practices matter and from other instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including on our legal, operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified team members, and our reputation;

•resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences;

•a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks;

•the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations (including federal securities laws and federal banking regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions.

For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its website at www.sec.gov.

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future results.

SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity securities but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the "Tangible Common Equity" tables on page 36.

(2)The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).

(3)Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.

(4)Consumer and small business banking deposits are total deposits excluding mortgage escrow and wholesale deposits.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(6)Book value per common share is common stockholders' equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding.

Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the "Tangible Common Equity" tables on page 36.

(2)The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).

(3)Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.

(4)Consumer and small business banking deposits are total deposits excluding mortgage escrow and wholesale deposits.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(6)Book value per common share is common stockholders' equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding.

CHANGES IN ACCRETABLE YIELD RELATED TO PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS

Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired. PCI loans predominantly represent loans acquired from Wachovia that were deemed to be credit impaired. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, recent borrower credit scores and recent LTV percentages. PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the associated allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date.

As a result of PCI loan accounting, certain credit-related ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.

The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated lives of the PCI loans using the effective yield method. The accretable yield is affected by:

•Changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans - Expected future cash flows are based on the variable rates in effect at the time of the quarterly assessment of expected cash flows;

•Changes in prepayment assumptions - Prepayments affect the estimated life of PCI loans which may change the amount of interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be collected; and

•Changes in the expected principal and interest payments over the estimated life - Updates to changes in expected cash flows are driven by the credit outlook and actions taken with borrowers. Changes in expected future cash flows from loan modifications are included in the regular evaluations of cash flows expected to be collected.

The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans since the merger with Wachovia is presented in the following table.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes accretable yield released as a result of settlements with borrowers, which is included in interest income.

(2)Includes accretable yield released as a result of sales to third parties, which is included in noninterest income.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (1) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity securities but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity.

(2)Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, which are included in other assets. 

(3)Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end.

COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 UNDER BASEL III (FULLY PHASED-IN) (1) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Basel III capital rules, adopted by the Federal Reserve Board on July 2, 2013, revised the definition of capital, increased minimum capital ratios, and introduced a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. The rules are being phased in through the end of 2021. Fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules. Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating CET1 and tier 1 capital, along with RWAs, became fully phased-in. 

(2)Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, which are included in other assets.

(3)Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end.

(4)The final Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks: the Standardized Approach, which replaced Basel I, and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions. Under the final rules, we are subject to the lower of our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy. Because the final determination of our CET1 ratio and which approach will produce the lower CET1 ratio as of December 31, 2018, is subject to detailed analysis of considerable data, our CET1 ratio at that date has been estimated using the Basel III definition of capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. The capital ratio for September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, was calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs.

(5)The Company’s December 31, 2018, RWAs and capital ratio are preliminary estimates.

OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS (1)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The management accounting process measures the performance of the operating segments based on our management structure and is not necessarily comparable with other similar information for other financial services companies. We define our operating segments by product type and customer segment. Effective first quarter 2018, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on a more granular level. This methodology change affects results across all three of our reportable operating segments and results for all periods prior to 2018 have been revised to reflect this methodology change. Our previously reported consolidated financial results were not impacted by the methodology change; however, in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-01 in first quarter 2018, certain reclassifications occurred within noninterest income.

(2)Includes the elimination of certain items that are included in more than one business segment, most of which represents products and services for Wealth and Investment Management customers served through Community Banking distribution channels.
