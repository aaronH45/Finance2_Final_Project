Regulation FD Disclosure.  

Members of Humana Inc.’s senior management team will be meeting with investors and analysts at industry conferences and various other meetings between January 3, 2019 and January 18, 2019. During the conferences and meetings, the Company intends to address its prospects and performance. The Company will not opine on any financial results or expectations for 2018 or 2019 at the meetings beyond those listed below since it is in the process of closing its books for 2018. The date and time of these presentations to investors are available via the Investor Relations calendar of events on Humana’s web site at www.humana.com, and the Company’s presentations during the conferences are expected to be webcast.  

Medicare Advantage and Stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (“PDP”) Enrollment  

Based on final annual enrollment period (AEP) results, the Company is revising its net membership growth estimate for its individual Medicare Advantage products for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 375,000 to 400,000 members, compared to its previous estimate of 350,000 to 400,000 members. The revised membership estimate represents expected net membership gains of 12 to 13 percent above the year ended December 31, 2018 membership level of approximately 3.07 million members. 

The Company also reiterates its expectations for group Medicare Advantage net membership gains for the same period, projecting an increase of approximately 30,000 members year over year. The membership estimate represents an expected net membership gain of 6 percent above the year ended December 31, 2018 membership level of approximately 500,000 members.  

For PDP, the Company now estimates a net membership decline of 700,000 to 750,000 members for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to its previous estimate of a decline of 750,000 to 800,000 members. The membership estimate represents a decline of 14 to 15 percent below the year ended December 31, 2018 membership level of approximately 5 million members. The revised estimate is primarily attributable to improved retention estimates.  

Full Year 2018 Adjusted EPS Guidance  

For the year ended December 31, 2018, Humana’s management expects to reaffirm its GAAP guidance of $11.96 in diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”), or approximately $14.40 in adjusted earnings per common share (“Adjusted EPS”). This guidance is consistent with the guidance issued in Humana’s press release dated November 7, 2018 and reaffirmed on November 28, 2018.  

The Company has included adjusted EPS in this current report, a financial measure that is not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Management believes that this measure, when presented in conjunction with the comparable measure of GAAP EPS, is useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the Company’s ongoing business and operating performance. Consequently, management uses adjusted EPS as an indicator of the Company’s business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP EPS. A reconciliation of adjusted EPS to GAAP EPS follows:

The Company plans to host a conference call and announce its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018 and provide detailed financial guidance for the year ended December 31, 2019, on Wednesday, February 6, 2019.
