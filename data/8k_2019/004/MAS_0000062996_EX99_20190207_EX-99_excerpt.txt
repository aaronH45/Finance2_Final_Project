2018 Fourth Quarter Operating Segment Highlights

•Plumbing Products’ net sales increased 4 percent (6 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency translation), driven by 8 percent growth in North America 

•Decorative Architectural Products’ net sales increased 30 percent; excluding the acquisition of Kichler, net sales increased 8 percent due to growth in paints and other coating products, partially due to sales pulled-forward from the first quarter of 2019

•Cabinetry Products’ net sales increased 1 percent; excluding the divestiture of Moores, sales increased 4 percent with growth in both the repair and remodel and new construction businesses

•Windows and Other Specialty Products’ net sales decreased 1 percent due to continued softness in the UK market, partially offset by growth in North America

“We delivered strong sales and profit growth in the fourth quarter of 2018, despite an increasingly challenging environment,” said Keith Allman, Masco’s President and CEO. “This growth was led by our Plumbing and Decorative Architectural Products segments. Additionally, we returned $336 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends during the quarter.”

•Free cash flow was $803 million

“We continued to execute on our long-term growth and capital allocation strategies to deliver strong sales, operating profit, and earnings per share growth in 2018, despite significant headwinds from increased commodity and logistics costs,” said Allman. “We achieved top- and bottom-line growth in our Plumbing Products segment led by strong 8 percent sales growth in North America. We grew sales and operating profit in our Decorative Architectural Products segment with the acquisition of Kichler Lighting, and continued growth in our paints and other coating products and builders’ hardware businesses. Our Cabinetry Products segment returned to growth in 2018 driven by its significant new retail program win, and we grew our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment excluding divestitures. We also continued our balanced capital allocation strategy by completing the $549 million acquisition of Kichler Lighting, repurchasing 18.6 million shares for $654 million, increasing our dividend for the fifth year in a row, and reducing debt by $106 million.”

“While we expect growth in some of our markets to moderate in 2019, we believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value by continuing to execute on our strategies in 2019,” continued Allman. “The fundamentals of the repair and remodel industry, which represents approximately 85% of our business, remain strong, and we anticipate our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.80 for 2019.”
