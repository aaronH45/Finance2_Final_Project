PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Q4 2018 vs. Q4 2017

FOURTH QUARTER 2018 RESULTS (continued)

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Q4 2018 vs. Q3 2018

▪The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to adjustments recorded in the current quarter associated with the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. These adjustments included a true-up to the Corporation’s 2017 income tax provision for “Federal Taxes on Mandatory Deemed Repatriation” with respect to the pre-2018 earnings of its non-US subsidiaries. In addition, during the current quarter the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued foreign tax credit guidance that favorably impacted the Corporation. Also contributing to the decrease in the provision for income taxes compared to the prior quarter was an adjustment to the tax benefit derived from vesting of restricted stock units.

▪Decreases to the provision for income taxes as noted above were partially offset by increases primarily related to income tax benefits recorded in the prior quarter associated with the re-establishment of a deferred tax asset based on the issuance of guidance by the IRS related to the implementation of the TCJA.

Q4 2018 vs. Q4 2017

▪The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the TCJA enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as adjustments recorded in the current quarter associated with the implementation of the TCJA. These adjustments included a true-up to the Corporation’s 2017 income tax provision for “Federal Taxes on Mandatory Deemed Repatriation” with respect to the pre-2018 earnings of its non-US subsidiaries. In addition, during the current quarter the IRS issued foreign tax credit guidance that favorably impacted the Corporation. 

▪Decreases to the provision for income taxes as noted above were partially offset by the net income tax benefit recorded in the prior-year quarter as a result of the enactment of the TCJA in 2017, tax accounting changes in 2018 brought about by the TCJA including the tax accounting associated with non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries, and an increase in income before income taxes.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Total stockholders’ equity averaged $10.3 billion, up $188.0 million, or 2% from the prior-year quarter’s average of $10.1 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to earnings, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation’s share repurchase program and dividend declarations. During the current quarter, the Corporation declared cash dividends totaling $5.9 million to preferred stockholders and cash dividends totaling $123.6 million to common stockholders. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation repurchased 2,523,655 shares of common stock, including 41,553 shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at a total cost of $234.6 million ($92.97 average price per share) and 9,001,064 shares of common stock, including 481,334 shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at a total cost of $924.3 million ($102.69 average price per share), respectively.

RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT

The following table presents a reconciliation of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-generally accepted accounting financial measures. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
