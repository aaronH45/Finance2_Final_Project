COLUMBUS, IND. - Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) today reported results for the fourth quarter of 2018.

Fourth quarter revenues of $6.1 billion increased 12 percent from the same quarter in 2017. Increased truck production in North America and stronger demand in global construction and power generation markets drove the majority of the revenue increase. Currency negatively impacted revenues by 2 percent primarily due to a stronger US dollar. 

Fourth quarter sales in North America improved by 17 percent while international revenues increased by 6 percent led by growth in Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the fourth quarter were $896 million, or 14.6 percent of sales, compared to $769 million or 14.0 percent of sales a year ago, or $808 million and 14.8 percent of sales excluding the impact of tax legislation. Fourth quarter results included EBITDA loss of $58 million related to a write-off of an investment in an electronic logging device or ELD business, and the mark to market impact on assets related to our non-qualified benefit plans.

Fourth quarter results were positively impacted by $25 million in discrete tax items and the impact of tax reform. Excluding these items, net income attributable to Cummins in the fourth quarter was $554 million ($3.48 per diluted share). The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 14.1 percent.

Revenues for the full year were a record $23.8 billion, 16 percent higher than 2017. Revenues in North America increased 19 percent and international sales grew 12 percent, with growth in all major regions.

EBITDA for the year was a record $3.5 billion or 14.6 percent of sales. This compares to $3.0 billion or 14.8 percent of sales in 2017, or $3.1 billion or 15.0 percent of sales excluding the impact of tax legislation.

Net income attributable to Cummins for the full year was $2.1 billion ($13.15 per diluted share), compared to a net income of $999 million ($5.97 per diluted share), or $1.8 billion ($10.62 per diluted share) excluding the impact of tax legislation.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Information

EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used in this release, and is defined and reconciled to what management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure in a schedule attached to this release. Cummins presents this information as it believes it is useful to understanding the Company's operating performance, and because EBITDA is a measure used internally to assess the performance of the operating units.

We believe net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. excluding Tax Legislation and other discrete tax items is a useful measure of our operating performance without regard to Tax Legislation and discrete tax adjustments. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for GAAP and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

Webcast information

Cummins management will host a teleconference to discuss these results today at 10 a.m. EST. This teleconference will be webcast and available on the Investor Relations section of the Cummins website at www.cummins.com.

INCOME TAXES 

Our effective tax rates for the three months and the year ended December 31, 2018, were 14.1 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively. 

The three months ended December 31, 2018, contained $51 million, or $0.32 per share, of favorable net discrete tax items, primarily due to $36 million of favorable discrete tax items related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) and $15 million of other favorable discrete tax items. The year ended December 31, 2018, contained $14 million, or $0.09 per share, of favorable net discrete tax items, primarily due to $26 million of other favorable discrete tax items, partially offset by $12 million of unfavorable discrete tax items related to the 2017 Tax Legislation. 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted Tax Legislation which, among other things, changed the U.S. statutory rate to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. The impact of the Tax Legislation resulted in a net incremental charge to our 2017 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income of $777 million. The 2018 charges reflect final adjustments and subsequent guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The components of the 2018 and 2017 charges were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_____________________________________________________

(1) Noncontrolling interest was adjusted for withholding taxes on foreign earnings which changed the income eliminated for Cummins ownership interest attributable to Cummins India, Ltd.

The effective tax rates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, were 151.8 percent and 58.0 percent,

respectively. 

The change in the effective tax rate for the three months and year ended, December 31, 2018, versus the comparable periods in 2017, was primarily due to lower U.S. tax rates in 2018 associated with Tax Legislation and the significant 2017 Tax Legislation expenses in 2017. 

We expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be 21.5 percent, excluding any discrete tax items.

PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

On January 1, 2018, we retroactively adopted the new accounting standard related to the presentation of pension and other postretirement benefit costs, which resulted in the adjustment of prior period balances in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income by the following amounts:

FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP

(Unaudited)

Reconciliation of Non GAAP measures - Earnings before interest, income taxes, noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)

Effective January 1, 2018, we use EBITDA as a primary basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results. It is also a component in measuring our variable compensation programs. We believe EBITDA is a useful measure for our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard for financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. Our 2017 and 2016 EBITDA measures, as restated, were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. It should be considered supplemental data; however, the amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are derived from amounts included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Below is a reconciliation of “Net income attributable to Cummins Inc.” to EBITDA for each of the applicable periods:
