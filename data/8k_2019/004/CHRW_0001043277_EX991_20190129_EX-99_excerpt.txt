North American Surface Transportation Results

Summarized financial results of our NAST segment are as follows (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth quarter total revenues for C.H. Robinson's NAST segment totaled $2.8 billion, an increase of 6.0 percent over the prior year, primarily driven by increased pricing. NAST net revenues increased 13.5 percent in the quarter to $471.4 million. Net revenues in truckload increased 13.0 percent, less than truckload (“LTL”) net revenues increased 11.5 percent, and intermodal net revenues increased 76.4 percent versus the year ago period, which included elevated repositioning charges. Excluding the impact of the change in fuel prices, our average North America truckload rate per mile charged to customers increased approximately 1.5 percent in the quarter, while our truckload transportation cost per mile decreased approximately 1 percent. Truckload volume declined 1.5 percent in the quarter. LTL volumes grew 2 percent, and intermodal volumes declined 13 percent versus the prior year. Operating expenses increased 10.9 percent, primarily due to increased variable compensation. Income from operations increased 16.9 percent to $211.0 million, and operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 44.8 percent in the quarter. NAST average headcount was up 1.3 percent in the quarter.

Fourth quarter total revenues for the Global Forwarding segment increased 14.5 percent to $677.1 million, driven by improved pricing across all service lines and volume growth in ocean and customs. Net revenues increased 11.6 percent in the quarter to $142.7 million. Ocean net revenues increased 12.4 percent driven by higher volumes and pricing. Net revenues in air increased 9.3 percent, as the air service line benefited from a decreasing cost environment. Customs net revenues increased 12.4 percent, driven by higher volumes and pricing. Operating expenses increased 1.7 percent, primarily driven by higher variable compensation that was partially offset by a 0.4 percent decrease in average headcount. Income from operations increased 76.9 percent to $29.8 million, and operating margin expanded 770 basis points to 20.9 percent in the quarter. 

Robinson Fresh Results 

Summarized financial results of our Robinson Fresh segment are as follows (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth quarter total revenues for the Robinson Fresh segment declined 10.6 percent to $531.8 million. Segment net revenues expanded 18.8 percent to $64.3 million in the quarter. Sourcing net revenues decreased 8.2 percent. Case volumes declined 6.5 percent, driven by lower restaurant traffic at our foodservice customers. Transportation net revenues increased 45.9 percent, primarily driven by truckload pricing increases. Robinson Fresh operating expenses increased 7.9 percent, driven by increased variable compensation expense, partially offset by a 5.1 percent reduction in average headcount. Income from operations increased 53.5 percent to $19.8 million, and operating margin expanded 700 basis points to 30.8 percent in the quarter.

All Other and Corporate Results

Net revenues for Managed Services and Other Surface Transportation are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth quarter Managed Services net revenues increased 10.9 percent to $20.3 million, driven by a combination of selling additional service lines to existing customers and new customer wins. Other Surface Transportation net revenues decreased 7.3 percent to $15.0 million, driven by pricing declines in Europe. 

Other Income Statement Items

The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 23.9 percent, up from 21.1 percent last year. The higher tax rate was driven primarily by one-time tax benefits that totaled $31.8 million in the year-ago period and was partially offset by a $28.4 million benefit in the current period from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We expect our full-year effective tax rate to be between 24 and 25 percent in 2019.

Due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 (“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”), in-transit shipments are now included in our financial results as of January 1, 2018. This new policy did not have a material impact on our overall operating results for the full year.

Interest and other expenses decreased by $8.0 million in the quarter driven primarily by a $2.4 million favorable impact from currency revaluation in the fourth quarter of 2018, versus a $6.2 million unfavorable impact in the year-ago period. This was partially offset by higher interest expense due to an increase in interest rates.

Diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were down 1.1 percent, as share repurchases were partially offset by activity in our equity compensation plans.

Cash Flow Generation and Capital Distribution

Fourth quarter cash from operations totaled $264.0 million, up 59.4 percent versus the prior year, primarily due to increased earnings and improved working capital performance versus the year-ago period. 

In the fourth quarter, $168.4 million was returned to shareholders, with $70.0 million in cash dividends and $98.4 million in share repurchases. This represents an increase of 42.4 percent over the prior year. 

Capital expenditures totaled $14.3 million in the quarter. We expect 2019 capital expenditures to be between $80 and $90 million, with the majority dedicated to technology.

Outlook

“As we turn to 2019, we are remain focused on top-line growth and operating margin expansion and believe our continued investments in technology will help enable us to achieve these objectives,” said John Wiehoff. “We are also committed to strong cash returns to shareholders.”

John added, “A critical part of our strategy is to make investments that add value for our customers and carriers and drive growth for our business, regardless of where we are in the freight cycle. I remain as confident as ever that we have the right people, processes and technology to continue to win in the marketplace.”
