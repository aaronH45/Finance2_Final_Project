Morningstar Fee Level: Morningstar evaluates a mutual fund share class's expense ratio relative to other funds that invest in a similar asset class and have similar distribution characteristics. Within each Comparison Group, a fund share class' expense ratio is ranked against peers using five quintiles.

It is a useful tool for putting a fund's fees into context, but alone is not a sufficient basis for investment decisions.
