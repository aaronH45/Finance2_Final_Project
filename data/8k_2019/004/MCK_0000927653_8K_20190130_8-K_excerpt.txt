In addition, the By-Laws amendments (a) permit a majority of the Board to call special meetings of the stockholders at any time; (b) update the advance notice provision to require information on third-party compensation and require proposed nominees to submit questionnaires to the Company; and (c) streamline the description of the majority vote provisions for the election of directors.
