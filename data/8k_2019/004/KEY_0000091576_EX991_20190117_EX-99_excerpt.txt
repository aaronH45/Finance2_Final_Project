CLEVELAND, January 17, 2019 - KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $459 million, or $.45 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $468 million, or $.45 per common share, for the third quarter of 2018 and $181 million, or $.17 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2018, Key’s results included notable items resulting in a net impact of $.03 per common share, consisting of a pension settlement charge and efficiency initiative expenses. No notable items were reported in the third quarter of 2018, however, notable items resulting in a net impact of $.19 per common share were reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders was $1.8 billion, or $1.70 per common share, compared to $1.2 billion, or $1.12 per common share, for the same period one year ago.

(a)The table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “Return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.

(b)12/31/18 ratio is estimated.

TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

TE = Taxable Equivalent

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, and the net interest margin was 3.16%, compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $952 million and a net interest margin of 3.09% for the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting the benefit from higher interest rates and higher earning asset balances. Fourth quarter 2018 net interest income included $23 million of purchase accounting accretion, a decline of $15 million from the fourth quarter of 2017.

Compared to the third quarter of 2018, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $15 million, and the net interest margin declined by two basis points. Net interest income benefited from higher earning asset balances, while the overall decline in the net interest margin reflects the impact of lower purchase accounting accretion.

Key’s noninterest income was $645 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $656 million for the year-ago quarter. Trust and investment services income declined $10 million, related to the sale of Key Insurance and Benefits Services in the second quarter of 2018. Cards and payments income and service charges on deposit accounts were impacted by the 2018 adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard. Excluding the revenue recognition changes, both of these line items grew from the prior year. Investment banking and debt placement fees were lower, following a record fourth quarter in 2017. Partially offsetting these declines were increases in other income and mortgage servicing fees. 

Compared to the third quarter of 2018, noninterest income increased by $36 million, driven by momentum in many of Key's core fee-based businesses. Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $20 million, largely related to strength in commercial mortgage banking and advisory fees. Corporate services income reflected higher derivatives and trading income, and trust and investment services income grew, largely due to stronger brokerage commissions.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Key’s noninterest expense was $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Personnel expense declined year-over-year, driven by lower incentive compensation and employee benefits costs, partially offset by increased severance expense related to Key's efficiency initiative. Net occupancy and marketing expenses also declined, largely related to merger-related charges in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Key's FDIC assessment costs decreased, due to the elimination of the FDIC quarterly surcharge.

Compared to the third quarter of 2018, noninterest expense increased by $48 million. The increase was primarily driven by notable items in the quarter - efficiency initiative expenses of $24 million and a $17 million pension settlement charge (reported in other expense). Business services and professional fees and other expense increased, but were partially offset by the benefit from the FDIC surcharge elimination.

 BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Average loans were $89.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $3.3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting broad-based growth in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by higher paydowns in home equity lines of credit.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

N/A = Not Applicable

Average deposits totaled $108.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $4.2 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting growth in higher-yielding deposit products, as well as strength in Key’s retail banking franchise and growth from commercial relationships. 

Compared to the third quarter of 2018, average deposits increased by $2.3 billion, driven primarily by the penetration of existing retail and commercial relationships, as well as short-term and seasonal deposit inflows.

(b)The table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons. See below for further information on the Regulatory Capital Rules. 

Key's capital position remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2018. As shown in the preceding table, at December 31, 2018, Key’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 9.92% and 11.07%, respectively. Key's tangible common equity ratio was 8.30% at December 31, 2018. 

As a “standardized approach” banking organization, Key’s mandatory compliance with the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”) began on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions. Key’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio as calculated under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules was 9.83% at December 31, 2018. This estimate exceeds the fully phased-in required minimum Common Equity Tier 1 and Capital Conservation Buffer of 7.00%. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Consistent with Key's 2018 Capital Plan, during the fourth quarter of 2018, Key declared a dividend of $.17 per common share and completed $278 million of common share repurchases. Key's remaining share repurchase authorization consistent with the 2018 Capital Plan (which continues through the second quarter of 2019) is $405 million.

Key Community Bank Summary of Operations (4Q18 vs. 4Q17)

•Positive operating leverage compared to the prior year

•Net income increased $109 million, or 71.7%, from the prior year

•Average commercial and industrial loans increased $1.0 billion, or 5.6%, from the prior year

Key Community Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $261 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $152 million for the year-ago quarter, benefiting from momentum in Key's core businesses, expense discipline, and a lower tax rate as a result of tax reform.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $70 million, or 10.4%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to the benefit from higher interest rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion. Average loans and leases increased $568 million, or 1.2%, largely driven by a $1.0 billion, or 5.6%, increase in commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, average deposits increased $3.9 billion, or 4.9%, from the fourth quarter of 2017 due to strength in our relationship strategy.

Noninterest income decreased $9 million, or 3.1%, from the year-ago quarter driven by lower service charges on deposit accounts and cards and payments income, which were impacted by revenue recognition changes. Excluding the impact of the accounting change, both businesses grew from the prior period, related to continued household growth.

The provision for credit losses decreased by $9 million, or 15.8%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loan charge-offs increased $7 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by a larger balance sheet.

Noninterest expense decreased by $32 million, or 4.8%, from the year-ago quarter. Both personnel and nonpersonnel expense declined, driven by strong expense discipline across the businesses while continuing to invest strategically for growth.

Key Corporate Bank Summary of Operations (4Q18 vs. 4Q17)

•Record year for investment banking and debt placement fees

•Commercial and industrial loans up $2.8 billion, or 12.7%, from prior year

 Key Corporate Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $215 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $223 million for the year-ago quarter.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $12 million, or 4.2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This decline is related to lower purchase accounting accretion, as well as loan spread compression. Average loan and lease balances increased $3 billion, or 8%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by broad-based growth in commercial and industrial loans. Average deposit balances increased $235 million, or 1.1%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in core deposits. 

 Noninterest income was down $12 million, or 3.7%, from the prior year. Investment banking and debt placement fees decreased $17 million, or 8.7%, from a record quarter in the year-ago period. This decrease was partially offset by increases in other noninterest income of $6 million related to higher gains on certain tax-advantaged assets, as well as higher mortgage servicing fees of $3 million.

 During the fourth quarter of 2018, the provision for credit losses increased $18 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, mostly related to loan growth.

 Noninterest expense decreased by $23 million, or 6.5%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from the prior year was largely driven by lower personnel expense. The prior year also had higher impairments on certain tax-advantaged assets related to tax reform. These decreases are slightly offset by higher volumes driving increased operating lease expense.

Other Segments

Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, Key’s Principal Investing unit, and various exit portfolios. Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $45 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $48 million for the same period last year.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(dollars in millions)

The table below presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “Common Equity Tier 1,” “pre-provision net revenue,” and “cash efficiency ratio.” 

The tangible common equity ratio and the return on average tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. In October 2013, the federal banking regulators published the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”). The Regulatory Capital Rules require higher and better-quality capital and introduced a new capital measure, “Common Equity Tier 1,” a non-GAAP financial measure. The mandatory compliance date for Key as a “standardized approach” banking organization began on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions. 

The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze the results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.

The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. As such, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of Key’s intangible asset amortization from the calculation. Management believes this ratio provide greater consistency and comparability between Key’s results and those of its peer banks. Additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
