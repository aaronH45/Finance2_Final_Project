Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On January 29, 2019, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Brown-Forman Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Company's By-laws, as previously amended on May 21, 2014 (the "By-laws") to add an advance notice provision. The amendment is reflected in the Amended and Restated By-laws (the "Restated By-laws") attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2.

The Restated By-Laws became effective immediately upon approval by the Board. The new advance notice provision in the Restated By-laws establishes timing, information, and procedural requirements for stockholders seeking to submit a proposal or director nomination at any annual or special meeting of stockholders. The advance notice provision requires a proposing stockholder to submit advance notice of such proposal or director nomination to the Company's corporate secretary not later than the 90th day, nor earlier than the 120th day, before the first anniversary of the prior year's annual stockholder meeting. The proposing stockholder will be required to comply with certain informational requirements in his or her notice, such as information about any potential director nominee, a description of any business desired to be brought before the meeting and the rationale for such business, and comprehensive information about the proposing stockholder. In addition, the Restated By-laws include certain non-substantive clarifying changes.

In accordance with the Restated By-laws, notice of a proposal or director nomination for consideration at the Company's upcoming 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received no earlier than March 28, 2019, and no later than April 27, 2019. 

The foregoing description is a summary of the amendment to the By-laws and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Restated By-laws, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
