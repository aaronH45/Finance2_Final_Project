Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement 

On January 15, 2019, Amphenol Corporation (the “Company”) entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated January 15, 2019 (the “Credit Agreement”), which amends and restates the Company’s existing credit facility, dated as of March 1, 2016, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, a syndicate of financial institutions and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as the administrative agent. The Credit Agreement increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments under the facility to $2.5 billion. 

A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. 

Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant 

See the information under Item 1.01 of this Current Report which is incorporated by reference herein. 

Item 8.01. Other Events 

On January 16, 2019, the Company increased the size of its U.S. commercial paper program (the “USCP Program”) by $500.0 million, to permit the issuance of commercial paper notes under the USCP Program in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.5 billion outstanding at any time.  The increase corresponds with the increase to $2.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement. Amounts undrawn under the Credit Agreement are available to repay the commercial paper notes under the USCP Program, if necessary. All other terms of the USCP Program have remained unchanged. The net proceeds of the issuances of the commercial paper notes under the USCP Program are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. 

Under the USCP Program, the Company may issue from time to time short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “USCP Notes”) through Citibank Global Markets Inc. and JP Morgan Securities LLC acting as dealers pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective dealer agreements with the Company dated as of August 29, 2014 and through MUFG Securities Americas Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Mizuho Securities USA Inc. acting as dealers pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective dealer agreements with the Company dated as of February 1, 2017, in each case, in substantially the form of the Dealer Agreement filed pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 3, 2014. 

The Company’s Board of Directors authorization for the increase of the USCP Program currently limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, the euro-commercial paper notes issued by the Company’s wholly owned indirect subsidiary, Amphenol Technologies Holding GmbH, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2.5 billion. 

The USCP Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws. The USCP Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws. The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.
