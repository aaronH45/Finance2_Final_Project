Adjusted net income, diluted earnings per share, pretax income and revenue are non-GAAP financial measures and exclude the Q4-17 impact of the enactment of the Tax Act. 3 The Corporation reports the results of operations of its four business segments and All Other on a fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) basis. 4 Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

Our teammates worked for our customers and delivered solid loan and deposit growth, and other activity, while managing risk well. Operating leverage based on disciplined expense management while investing in our future, solid asset quality, and loan and deposit growth drove this quarter’s results. In addition to lending and investing activities, we shared success in many ways: returning nearly $26 billion in capital to our shareholders; a second bonus since U.S. tax reform passed last year, impacting 95% of our teammates, to share success from our performance and the benefits of tax reduction; and more than $200 million of philanthropic giving to our communities. “Through the trillions of dollars of consumer transactions we process and from the steady confidence and activity of our small business and commercial clients, we see a healthy consumer and business climate driving a solid economy. Each of our businesses faces opportunities to grow even more. We are well positioned to serve clients, teammates, and communities by listening to their answer when we ask them: ‘What would you like the power to do?’” — Brian Moynihan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer CFO Commentary “We have now seen 16 consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage, enabled by responsible growth. Our net income grew robustly and our EPS grew faster as we invested part of our profits in share repurchases. We significantly improved our returns in the fourth quarter, with a 1.24% return on average assets and a 16.3% return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity. Each line of business contributed to these results. With a strong balance sheet, we’re ready to deliver again in 2019.” — Paul Donofrio, Chief Financial Officer 1 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted, which included a lower U.S. corporate tax rate effective in 2018.

Endnotes A We also measure net interest income on an FTE basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. FTE basis is a performance measure used in operating the business that management believes provides investors a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. We believe that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practices. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $12.5 billion, $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The FTE adjustment was $155 million, $151 million and $251 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. B Global Markets revenue and net income, excluding net debit valuation adjustments (DVA), and sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, are non- GAAP financial measures. Net DVA gains (losses) were $52 million, $(99) million and $(118) million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. FICC net DVA gains (losses) were $45 million, $(80) million and $(112) million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Equities net DVA gains (losses) were $7 million, $(19) million and $(6) million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. C Enactment of the Tax Act reduced Q4-17 and FY 2017 net income by $2.9 billion, or $0.27 per diluted common share, which included a $0.9 billion pretax charge in other noninterest income (which reduced pretax income and revenue, net of interest expense) predominantly related to the revaluation of certain tax-advantaged energy investments, as well as $1.9 billion of tax expense principally associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The enactment negatively impacted Q4-17 and FY 2017 return on average assets by 49 bps and 13 bps, respectively; return on average common shareholders’ equity by 455 bps and 117 bps, respectively; return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity by 630 bps and 162 bps, respectively; and efficiency ratio by 287 bps and 67 bps, respectively. Reported metrics are shown on pages 1 and 2 of this press release. D Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 19 of this press release for reconciliation to GAAP financial measures. E Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, limited to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise.

We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 19. (2) Includes non-U.S. credit card net charge-offs of $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These net charge-offs represent net charge-offs of non-U.S. credit card loans, which were sold in the second quarter of 2017. (3) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation. (4) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by agreements (fully insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate; purchased credit-impaired loans even though the customer may be contractually past due; and nonperforming loans held-for-sale or accounted for under the fair value option. (5) Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2018 are preliminary. Bank of America Corporation (the Corporation) reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, which for CET1 is the Standardized approach at December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018 and the Advanced approaches at December 31, 2017. Basel 3 transition provisions for regulatory capital adjustments and deductions were fully phased-in as of January 1, 2018. Prior periods are presented on a fully phased-in basis. (6) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible shareholders’ equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 19. Current period information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the presentation.

 19 Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures (Dollars in millions) The Corporation evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation’s use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
