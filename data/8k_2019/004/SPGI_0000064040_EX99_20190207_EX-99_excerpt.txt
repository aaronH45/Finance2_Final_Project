New York, NY, February 7, 2019 – S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results. The Company reported fourth quarter 2018 revenue of $1.54 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to the same period last year as a decline in Ratings revenue, primarily resulting from a decline in global debt issuance, offset revenue increases in the Company's other three businesses. On an organic basis, fourth quarter revenue decreased 4%.

Fourth quarter net income increased 95% to $512 million and diluted earnings per share increased 99% to $2.03. Both increased due to a charge associated with U.S. tax reform included in the prior year quarter as well as productivity improvements and a lower effective tax rate as a result of U.S. tax reform impacting the current quarter. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter increased 18% to $559 million due to productivity improvements and a lower effective tax rate as a result of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% to $2.22 aided by a 2% reduction in diluted shares outstanding. Pre-tax adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $62 million and included deal-related amortization, restructuring charges, Kensho retention-related expenses, and a pension accounting adjustment.

For the full year, revenue increased 3% to $6.26 billion. 2018 net income increased 31% to $1.96 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 34% to $7.73. 2018 adjusted net income increased 21% to $2.15 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $8.50.

“While bond issuance can be periodically interrupted by market forces, as was the case during the second half of 2018, we remain confident that, in the long run, global debt market growth will track GDP growth. Despite the return of market volatility in 2018, the Company continued to grow revenue and increase profitability, putting us well on our way to deliver on the financial targets we announced at our Investor Day in May,” said Douglas L. Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer of S&P Global. He added, “In 2018, we continued to build our capabilities by adding leading-edge technology and unique data sets through the acquisitions of Kensho, Panjiva, and RateWatch; preparing for new product launches including ESG tools using Trucost analysis and domestic bond ratings in the China market; and leveraging technology to improve operational excellence through productivity improvements. As we look ahead and across the globe, we’re positioned more strongly than ever to provide the essential intelligence our customers need to make decisions with conviction.” 

Profit Margin: For the full year, the Company's operating profit margin improved by 200 basis points to 44.6% as the Company continued to achieve revenue growth and successfully deliver productivity improvements. The adjusted operating profit margin improved by 230 basis points to 48.8% in 2018.

Return of Capital: Consistent with the Company's capital allocation framework, the Company returned $2.2 billion to shareholders in 2018 with $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $503 million in dividends. Share repurchases drove more than a 2% reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding during 2018. On January 2, 2019, the Company completed its latest accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program, a $500 million program announced in October 2018. Beginning later this month, the Company expects to initiate a new $500 million ASR program that will conclude no later than July 2019.

Dividend: On January 30, 2019, the Board of Directors of S&P Global approved a 14% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s common stock. The quarterly dividend will increase from $0.50 to $0.57 per share. The next dividend is payable on March 12, 2019, to shareholders of record on February 26, 2019. The new annualized dividend rate is $2.28 per share and has increased at an average compound annual growth rate of 9.9% since 1974. The Company has paid a dividend each year since 1937 and is one of fewer than 25 companies in the S&P 500 that has increased its dividend annually for at least the last 46 years.

Strategy Update: At our Investor Day in May 2018, the Company initiated several medium-term financial targets. The first was a $100 million target for cost reduction savings. The Company estimates that, on a run-rate basis, $60 million in savings was achieved by year-end 2018. The second was to improve the adjusted operating profit margin for the Company from 46.5% at the end of 2017 to the low-50's over the next few years. During 2018, the Company achieved 230 basis points of improvement to 48.8%.

Ratings: 

4th Quarter, 2018: Revenue decreased 16% to $661 million. Non-transaction revenue decreased 3% to $378 million during the quarter primarily due to forex, lower excess issuance fees associated with medium-term notes, and lower Rating Evaluation Services activity which together were partially offset by growth from new entity credit ratings. Transaction revenue decreased 29% to $283 million in the fourth quarter primarily due to debt issuance reductions offset partially by higher bank loan rating revenue. 

Operating profit decreased 4% to $357 million due to decreased revenue. Operating profit margin increased 680 basis points to 54.0% in the quarter primarily due to a legal reserve that was recorded in the prior period as well as productivity improvements and reduced incentive compensation in the current period. Adjusted

S&P Dow Jones Indices:

S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC is a majority owned subsidiary. The consolidated results are included in S&P Global's income statement and the portion related to the 27% noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 

Despite stock market declines, industry inflows into exchange-traded products reached $499 billion in 2018, of which approximately $90 billion was added to ETFs associated with our indices. Year-end 2018 ETF AUM associated with our indices declined $34 billion from year-end 2017 to $1.3 trillion as stock market declines outpaced inflows. Nevertheless, SPDJI benefited from a return of market volatility which increased revenue associated with exchange-traded derivatives. 

4th Quarter, 2018: Revenue increased 13% to $215 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Revenue improved primarily due to increased derivatives trading activity. Average AUM in exchange-traded funds based on SPDJI's indices was $1.4 trillion in the quarter, an increase of 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2017.

Corporate Unallocated:

4th Quarter, 2018: Corporate Unallocated includes corporate revenue and non-allocated corporate expenses. Corporate Unallocated operating loss was reduced by 23% to $54 million primarily due to lease exit charges in the previous period as well as lower real estate costs, incentive compensation, and professional fees in the fourth quarter of 2018. These benefits were partially offset by Kensho expenses including retention-related expenses. Corporate Unallocated adjusted operating loss was reduced by 24% to $35 million primarily due to lower real estate costs, incentive compensation, and professional fees in the 4th quarter of 2018. These benefits were partially offset by Kensho expenses.

2018: Corporate Unallocated operating loss increased 19% to $231 million primarily due to Kensho expenses including retention-related expenses partially offset by lower real estate costs, incentive compensation, and professional fees. Corporate Unallocated adjusted operating loss was reduced by 6% to $156 million primarily due to lower real estate costs, incentive compensation, and professional fees partially offset by Kensho expenses.

Provision for Income Taxes: U.S. tax reform has had an immediate and meaningful impact on the Company's effective tax rate. The Company's effective tax rates in 2018 and 2017 were 20.9% and 33.4%, respectively. The adjusted effective tax rates in 2018 and 2017 were 21.5% and 28.9%, respectively.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow: Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter were $2.0 billion. For full-year 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $2.06 billion. Free cash flow was $1.80 billion, an increase of $15 million from 2017. Free cash flow, excluding tax on gains from divestitures, tax audit settlements, and the after-tax payments associated with legal settlements, was $2.01 billion, an increase of $155 million over 2017.

Outlook: The Company is introducing 2019 guidance with reported revenue expected to increase mid single-digits. On a U.S. GAAP basis, diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.50 to $8.70 and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.95 to $9.15. Adjusted diluted EPS excludes amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions and Kensho retention plans. Free cash flow excluding certain items is expected to be in a range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion.

Comparison of Adjusted Information to U.S. GAAP Information: The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company also refers to and presents certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted diluted earnings 

Page 4

per share, adjusted net income, adjusted operating profit and margin, organic revenue, adjusted Corporate Unallocated, adjusted effective tax rates, adjusted diluted EPS guidance, free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items. The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP on Exhibits 5, 8, and 9. The Company’s non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that, in the case of non-GAAP financial measures other than free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items, enables investors to better compare the Company’s performance across periods, and management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its business, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management and that such measures are useful in evaluating the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and repurchase stock. However, investors should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports.
