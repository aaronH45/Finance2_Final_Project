 Full-Year 2018 FFOA per share as compared to full-year 2019 FFOA per share guidance at the midpoint:  

 The difference between the Company’s full-year 2018 FFOA of $1.96 per share and the $2.05 per share midpoint of its full-year 2019 FFOA guidance range is primarily due to:  

   ·    A positive impact of approximately $0.08 from same-store, stabilized JVs and commercial operations; 

   ·    A positive impact of approximately $0.05 from development, DCP and other transactional activity;  

   ·    A negative impact of approximately $0.01 from higher G&A; 

   ·    A negative impact of approximately $0.01 from the recent equity issuance; and 

   ·    A negative impact of approximately $0.02 from higher incremental financing costs inclusive of higher LIBOR expectations.
