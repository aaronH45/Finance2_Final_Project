CEO COMMENTARY

Harris H. Simmons, Chairman and CEO, commented, “We’re pleased with the Bank’s performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2018. Quarterly earnings per share doubled to $1.08, compared to $0.54 a year ago, while annual earnings per share increased 57% to $4.08 from $2.60. Although a reduction in the effective tax rate contributed significantly to the improved earnings, pre-tax pre-provision net revenues increased a strong 13% for the quarter even after excluding a $12 million one-time charitable expense a year ago, and the efficiency ratio improved to 57.8% from 61.6% in the year-ago quarter. Credit quality was exceptional, with net credit recoveries of $8 million and a 39% reduction in nonperforming assets from last year’s fourth quarter.” Mr. Simmons added, “We are especially pleased with both the solid loan growth and the continued strong performance of our deposit base. Despite four federal funds rate increases over the past year, average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased slightly, and averaged 45% of total deposits for the quarter, similar to the year-ago period, contributing to a 22 basis point increase in our net interest margin.”

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net interest income increased to $576 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from $526 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The $50 million, or 10%, increase in reported net interest income was attributable to a $78 million increase in interest and fees on loans, resulting from increases in consumer and commercial loans and short-term interest rates. The increase in short-term interest rates also contributed to a $44 million increase in interest expense. 

The yield on interest earning assets was 4.17%, an increase of 11 basis points, compared with the third quarter of 2018, and 48 basis points, compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. When adjusted for interest recoveries of $3 million, using $1 million per loan as the reporting threshold, in the third quarter of 2018, the yield on interest earning assets increased 13 basis points from that period. During the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, the Bank did not experience any interest income recoveries of at least $1 million per loan. 

The rate paid on total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.54% for the fourth quarter of 2018, from 0.45% for the third quarter of 2018, and 0.25% for the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of increases in short-term interest rates. The total annualized cost of total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0.35%, compared with 0.28% for the third quarter of 2018, and 0.13% for the fourth quarter of 2017.

The net interest margin increased to 3.67% in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 3.63% in the third quarter of 2018, and 3.45% in the same prior year period due to the aforementioned items.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased by $1 million, or 1%, to $140 million from $139 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a $3 million increase in other service charges, commissions and fees due to higher loan commitment fees and customer interest rate swap management fees. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 For information on non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 18-21.

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $419 million, compared with $417 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Salaries and employee benefits increased $17 million primarily due to an $11 million increase in base salaries resulting from salary increases related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, merit increases and increased headcount. The remaining $6 million increase was primarily a result of a $2 million increase in incentive compensation, a $2 million increase in employee medical expenses and a $2 million increase in the Bank’s contribution to the employee 401(k) plan. Occupancy expense was $6 million higher in the current quarter because in the fourth quarter of 2017 the Bank recognized lower than expected expenses primarily due to insurance and recoveries related to Hurricane Harvey.

The increases in the aforementioned noninterest expense categories were partially offset by a $14 million decrease in other noninterest expense and a $7 million decrease in FDIC premiums. The decrease in other noninterest expense is

primarily due to a $12 million charitable contribution made in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act that did not recur in the current quarter. The decrease in FDIC premiums is primarily due to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge for large banks because the required Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio has been met.

Our efficiency ratio improved to 57.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 58.8% in the third quarter of 2018, and 61.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased $3 million to $418 million, compared with $415 million for the same prior year period. For information on non-GAAP financial measures, including differences between noninterest expense and adjusted noninterest expense, see pages 18-21.

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 22.1% for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 23.6% for the third quarter of 2018 and 52.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The income tax rates for 2018 were positively impacted by the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. Additionally, the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 rate benefited from additional tax planning items impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the release of a federal valuation allowance related to the net operating loss of a prior subsidiary. The decrease in the income tax rate from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 was also impacted by a $47 million provisional non-cash charge recognized as income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Asset quality continued to improve for the entire loan portfolio when compared with the prior quarter and the same prior year period, partially due to continued improvements in the oil and gas-related portfolio.

The Bank recorded a $6 million provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $(11) million during the third quarter of 2018, and $(12) million for the fourth quarter of 2017. 

The $6 million provision for credit losses reflects a decline in the quantitative portion of the allowance for loan losses, primarily from improved credit quality, and an increase in the qualitative portion related to recent general economic indicators, including increased stock market volatility, higher short-term interest rates, a flattened yield curve, and a decline in oil prices. The allowance for loan losses was $495 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $518 million at December 31, 2017, or 1.06% and 1.16% of loans and leases, respectively. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Loans and leases, net of unearned income and fees, increased $1.9 billion, or 4%, to $46.7 billion at December 31, 2018 from $44.8 billion at December 31, 2017. The largest increases were in commercial loans and consumer loans. Within commercial loans, municipal and owner-occupied loans increased $390 million and $373 million, respectively. The increase in consumer loans was primarily in 1-4 family residential loans, which increased $514 million. Unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit increased to $22.5 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $20.5 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was predominantly in commitments relating to commercial and industrial and commercial real estate construction and land development loans.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total deposits increased by $1.5 billion, or 3%, from $52.6 billion at December 31, 2017. Average total deposits increased to $54.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $52.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased slightly to $24.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $24.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, and were 45% and 46% of average total deposits, respectively, for the same periods.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Bank’s common stock dividend was $0.30 per share, compared with $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Common stock repurchases during the current quarter totaled $250 million, or 5.1 million shares, which is equivalent to 2.7% of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2018. During the last four quarters, the Bank repurchased $670 million, or 12.9 million shares, of common stock which is equivalent to 6.6% of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Weighted average diluted shares decreased by 10.6 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to the aforementioned share repurchases and a reduction in the dilutive impact of warrants (NASDAQ: ZIONZ and ZIONW) as the weighted average share price decreased from $47.89 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $46.61 in fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 29.3 million ZIONW warrants outstanding. The ZIONZ warrants expired on November 14, 2018, and the ZIONW warrants expire on May 22, 2020. 

Tangible book value per common share increased to $31.97 at December 31, 2018, compared with $30.87 at December 31, 2017. Basel III common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital was $6.2 billion at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The estimated Basel III CET1 capital ratio was 11.7% at December 31, 2018 compared with 12.1% at December 31, 2017. For information on non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 18-21.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(Unaudited)

This press release presents non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to provide investors with additional information. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following schedules. The Bank considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance and financial position of the Bank and for presentations of Bank performance to investors. The Bank further believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Bank on the same basis as that applied by management.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.

The following are non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release and a discussion of the reasons for which management uses these non-GAAP measures:

Tangible Book Value per Common Share – this schedule also includes “tangible common equity.” Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides additional useful information about the level of tangible equity in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

Return on Average Tangible Common Equity – this schedule also includes “net earnings applicable to common shareholders, excluding the effects of the adjustments, net of tax” and “average tangible common equity.” Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful information about the Bank’s use of shareholders’ equity. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

Efficiency Ratio – this schedule also includes “adjusted noninterest expense,” “taxable-equivalent net interest income,” “adjusted taxable-equivalent revenue,” and “adjusted pre-provision net revenue (PPNR).” The methodology of determining the efficiency ratio may differ among companies. Management makes adjustments to exclude certain items as identified in the subsequent schedules which it believes allows for more consistent comparability among periods. Management believes the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how well the Bank is managing its expenses, and adjusted PPNR enables management and others to assess the Bank’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.
