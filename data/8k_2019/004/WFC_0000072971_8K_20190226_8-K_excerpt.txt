Item 8.01 Other Events.

Wells Fargo & Company (the Company) is filing this Form 8-K to revise certain items included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, in anticipation of filing post-effective amendments to its registration statements on Form S-3. The revisions reflect, for all periods presented, a realignment of the Company’s operating segments effective January 1, 2017. The realignment of operating segments resulted from the change, adopted in first quarter 2018, in our methodology for assigning funding charges and credits to our lines of business and for certain other reclassifications. Effective first quarter 2018, assets and liabilities received a funding charge or credit that considered interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on a more granular level. This methodology change affected results across all three of our reportable operating segments. These

tables are being furnished solely to facilitate period to period comparisons. The Company's previously reported consolidated financial results were not impacted by the methodology change.

In addition, the revised consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information reflect the Company’s January 1, 2018, adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-18 – Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash and ASU 2016-15 – Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, the disclosure provisions of which are required to be applied retrospectively. 

This filing on Form 8-K also amends the following enumerated items included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017: 

•Item 1 – Business – Description of Business

•Item 5 – Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

•Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;

•Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

This filing does not change any information contained in any other item of the Company’s Form 10-K as originally filed on March 1, 2018. This filing also does not reflect events that have occurred after the original filing date of the Form 10-K, except as described above with respect to adoption of ASU 2016-18 and ASU 2016-15.
