The company has included financial measures throughout this earnings release that are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these measures, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures, are useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the company’s ongoing business and operating performance. Consequently, management uses these non-GAAP (Adjusted) financial measures as indicators of the company’s business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Non-GAAP (Adjusted) financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. All financial measures in this press release are in accordance with GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Please refer to the footnotes for a detailed description of each item adjusted out of GAAP financial measures to arrive at a non-GAAP (Adjusted) financial measure.  

“We’re pleased with the consistency of and ongoing improvement in our performance, which can be attributed to our focus on optimizing our core operations,” said Bruce D. Broussard, Humana’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “The investments we made in 2018 to improve consumer experience, clinical programs and external broker relationships all contributed to our ability to exceed average industry growth in Medicare Advantage (MA) for 2019, with full membership growth estimated between 375,000-400,000 members. Also, both the 2019 improved MA rates and moratorium on the health insurance industry fee (HIF) allowed us to deliver improvements to our members through better benefits and lower premiums.”  

Summary of 4Q18 and FY 2018 Results  

GAAP and Adjusted pretax income and EPS results for 4Q18 and FY 2018 continued to outperform management expectations, primarily driven by the persistence of lower inpatient medical utilization, partially offset by higher outpatient spending in the Retail segment.  

The company’s year-over-year results in both 4Q18 and FY 2018 were favorably impacted by strong Medicare Advantage membership growth and significant operating efficiencies in FY 2018 driven by productivity initiatives implemented in 2017. These increases were partially offset by the company’s offering of enhanced 2018 Medicare Advantage member benefits which resulted from the investment of the better than expected 2017 individual Medicare Advantage pretax earnings, coupled with the return of the health insurance industry fee and the more severe flu season during the first quarter of 2018.  

2   

GAAP and Adjusted EPS results for 4Q18 and FY 2018 were further positively impacted by the benefit of a lower tax rate year-over-year as a result of the Tax Reform Law enacted in 4Q17, allowing the company to invest pretax dollars in its employees, the communities of its members, technology and its integrated care delivery model to drive more affordable healthcare and better clinical outcomes; and a lower number of shares in 2018, primarily reflecting share repurchases.  

Below is a summary of key consolidated and segment statistics comparing 4Q18 to 4Q17 and FY 2018 to FY 2017.

2019 Earnings Guidance  

The company provided its GAAP and Adjusted EPS guidance for the year ended December 31, 2019 (FY 2019) as detailed below. GAAP and Adjusted results for FY 2018 are also shown for comparison.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

“Our solid execution in 2018 resulted in Adjusted EPS growth of over 20 percent and positions us well for 2019,” said Brian A. Kane, Chief Financial Officer. “Our 2019 guidance reflects Adjusted EPS growth of 17 to 20 percent combined with individual Medicare Advantage membership growth significantly in excess of the industry.”  

2020 Preliminary Rate Notice  

On Wednesday, January 30, 2019, after the stock market closed, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued its preliminary 2020 Medicare Advantage and Part D payment rates and proposed policy changes (collectively, the Advance Notice). CMS has invited public comment on the Advance Notice before publishing final rates on April 1, 2019 (the Final Notice).  

In the Advance Notice, CMS estimates Medicare Advantage plans across the sector will, on average, experience a 1.59 percent increase in benchmark funding based on proposals included therein. As indicated by CMS, its estimate excludes the impact of fee-for-service county rebasing/re-pricing since the related impact is dependent upon finalization of certain data, which will be available with the publication of the Final Notice.  

3   

Based on the company’s preliminary analysis using the same factors CMS included in its estimate, the components of which are detailed on CMS’ website, Humana anticipates the proposals in the Advance Notice would result in a change to its benchmark funding relatively in line with CMS’ estimate.  

The company will be drawing upon its program expertise to provide CMS formal commentary on the impact of the Advance Notice and the related impact upon Medicare beneficiaries’ quality of care and service to its members through the Medicare Advantage program.

Cautionary Statement  

This news release includes forward-looking statements regarding Humana within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Humana’s executive officers, the words or phrases like “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “likely will result,” “estimates,” “projects” or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.  

These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following:  

   •    

If Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana receives are insufficient to cover the cost of healthcare services delivered to its members, if the company is unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better healthcare experience for its members, lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of its members, or if its estimates of benefits expense are inadequate, Humana’s profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. The company continually reviews estimates of future payments relating to benefit expenses for services incurred in the current and prior periods and makes necessary adjustments to its reserves, including premium deficiency reserves, where appropriate. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends, so any reserves the company may establish, including premium deficiency reserves, may be insufficient.  

   •    

If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, particularly its Medicare initiatives and state-based contract strategy, the company’s business may be materially adversely affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of the company’s revenues in these products. In addition, there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in maintaining or improving its Star ratings in future years.  

   •    

If Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically implement new information systems, to protect Humana’s proprietary rights to its systems, or to defend against cyber-security attacks, the company’s business may be materially adversely affected.  

   •    

Humana is involved in various legal actions, or disputes that could lead to legal actions (such as, among other things, provider contract disputes and qui tam litigation brought by individuals on behalf of the government), governmental and internal investigations, and routine internal review of business processes any of which, if resolved unfavorably to the company, could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in its business practices. Increased litigation and negative publicity could also increase the company’s cost of doing business.  

   •    

As a government contractor, Humana is exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect its business or its willingness or ability to participate in government healthcare programs including, among other things, loss of material government contracts, governmental audits and investigations, potential inadequacy of government determined payment rates, potential restrictions on profitability, including by comparison of profitability of the company’s Medicare Advantage business to non-Medicare Advantage business, or other changes in the governmental programs in which Humana participates. Changes to the risk-adjustment model utilized by CMS to adjust premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to the health status of covered members, including proposed changes to the methodology used by CMS for risk adjustment data validation audits that fail to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence, if implemented, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.  

   •    

The Healthcare Reform Law, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on Humana’s results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting the company’s ability to expand into new markets, increasing the company’s medical and operating costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products, lowering the company’s Medicare payment rates and increasing the company’s expenses associated with a non-deductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments; the company’s financial position, including the company’s ability to maintain the value of its goodwill; and the company’s cash flows. Additionally, potential legislative or judicial changes, including activities to invalidate, repeal or replace, in whole or in part, the Health Care Reform Law, creates uncertainty for Humana’s business, and when, or in what form, such legislative or judicial changes may occur cannot be predicted with certainty.  

   •    

Humana’s business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase the company’s cost of doing business and may adversely affect the company’s business, profitability and cash flows.  

6   

   •    

Humana’s failure to manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  

   •    

If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the company’s business may be adversely affected.  

   •    

Humana’s pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses.  

   •    

Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect Humana’s financial performance.  

   •    

If Humana does not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, Humana’s gross margins may decline.  

   •    

Humana’s ability to obtain funds from certain of its licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.  

   •    

Downgrades in Humana’s debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.  

   •    

The securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which may adversely affect Humana’s business.  

In making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that the company is unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
