Item 8.01   Other Events

Principal Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”) has received notice of an unsolicited “mini-tender” offer by Baker Mills LLC (“Baker Mills”) to purchase up to 150,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The offer price of $36.00 per share is approximately 29 percent lower than the $50.79 per share closing price for the Company’s common stock on February 15, 2019, the last trading date before the February 18, 2019 offer date. The shares subject to Baker Mills' offer represent approximately 0.05 percent of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of the date of the offer. This is the seventh such offer (not including three amended offers) Baker Mills made to Company shareholders. 

The company does not endorse Baker Mills' unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not associated in any way with Baker Mills, its mini-tender offer, or its mini-tender offer documents.

On February 22, 2019, the Company issued the press release attached to this Report as Exhibit 99, informing its shareholders that the Company does not endorse Baker Mills unsolicited mini-tender offer and recommending that shareholders not tender their shares to Baker Mills. Shareholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time prior to the expiration of the offer, in accordance with Baker Mills' offering documents. Baker Mills' offer is currently scheduled to expire at 8:00 p.m., Eastern time, on Tuesday, March 26, 2019.
