 Item 2.01  

Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets  

On January 1, 2019, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 2, 2018 (the Merger Agreement) by and among Dominion Energy, Inc. (Dominion Energy), Sedona Corp. (Merger Sub) and SCANA Corporation (SCANA), Merger Sub merged with and into SCANA (the Merger), with SCANA continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy.  

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of issued and outstanding SCANA common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.6690 shares of Dominion Energy common stock (the Merger Consideration). Approximately 95,611,418 shares of Dominion Energy common stock will be issued to former SCANA shareholders. No fractional shares will be issued in the Merger; instead, if a former SCANA shareholder would be owed a fraction of a share of Dominion Energy common stock pursuant to the Merger, such former SCANA shareholder will receive the value of that fraction of a share in cash, without interest, where value is based on a formula set out in the Merger Agreement that takes into account the recent trading prices of Dominion Energy common stock before the effective time of the Merger. In addition, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding SCANA performance share award and restricted stock award will fully vest in accordance with the Merger Agreement and will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, based on a formula set out in the Merger Agreement that takes into account the recent trading prices of Dominion Energy common stock before the effective time of the Merger, the Merger Consideration per share of SCANA common stock and the number of shares of SCANA common stock previously underlying such equity compensation award. At the effective time of the Merger, there were 670,407 shares of SCANA common stock previously underlying such equity compensation awards. The Merger Agreement also provided for the conversion at the effective time of the Merger of deferred units in respect of SCANA shares credited to participants in SCANA’s deferred compensation plans for directors and executives into deferred units in respect of Dominion shares under such plans based on a formula set out in the Merger Agreement. However, there were no deferred units in respect of SCANA shares outstanding at the effective time of the Merger and, consequently, no such conversions took place.  

The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 5, 2018 as Exhibit 2.1 to Dominion Energy’s Current Report on Form 8-K, and which is incorporated herein by reference.
