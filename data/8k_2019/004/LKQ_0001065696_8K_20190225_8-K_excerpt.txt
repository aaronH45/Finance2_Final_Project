Item 8.01Other Events.

In 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of LKQ Corporation (the "Compensation Committee") began discussions regarding possible changes to the executive officer compensation program to better align the performance measures of the incentive compensation components with our business objectives. The Compensation Committee engaged Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc., an independent executive compensation advisor, to review our executive officer compensation program, benchmark it against our peer group and offer any recommendations for changes. On February 25, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the following modifications to the executive officer compensation program commencing with 2019 compensation:

•Changed the performance measures for the annual bonus opportunity to (i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), (ii) EBITDA as a percent of revenue, and (iii) Free Cash Flow;

•Changed the performance measures of the three-year cash long term incentive award to (i) organic revenue growth percentage, (ii) Adjusted earnings per share, and (iii) return on invested capital; and

•Established a new performance-based three-year restricted stock unit program with the performance measures being the same as the revised three-year cash incentive award, and allocated 50% of each executive officer’s three-year incentive award to this equity-based component and 50% to the three-year cash incentive award.
