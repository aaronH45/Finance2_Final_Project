Bylaw Amendment

On January 23, 2019, the Board of Directors amended the Bylaws of Norfolk Southern Corporation, effective February 10, 2019, to revise the advance notice provisions, in Article I - Section 9 and Article II – Section 7, for submission of matters not to be included in the proxy statement. The current submission deadline of ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary date of the previous year’s annual meeting has been changed to one hundred twenty (120) days prior to anniversary date of the mailing of the corporation’s proxy statement filed in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting, which is the same submission deadline for submission of matters to be included in the proxy statement. The amendments also change the number of days for submission of matters not to be included in the proxy statement and provide an advance notice provision timeline where no annual meeting was held the previous year or the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after the preceding year’s annual meeting. 

The description of the amendments to the Bylaws herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws filed herewith as Exhibit 3(iii) and incorporated by reference herein.
