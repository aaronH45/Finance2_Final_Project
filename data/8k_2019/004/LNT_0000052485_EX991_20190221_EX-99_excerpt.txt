ALLIANT ENERGY ANNOUNCES 2018 RESULTS

MADISON, Wis. - February 21, 2019 - Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: LNT) today announced U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP consolidated unaudited earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for 2018 and 2017 as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“We once again delivered solid financial and operational results in 2018. Our 2018 temperature normalized Non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.11, 6 percent above 2017 and consistent with our long-term earnings growth goal,” said Patricia Kampling, Alliant Energy Chairman and CEO. “I am proud to report that over the last five years we have delivered a total shareholder return of 93 percent, exceeding the growth of both the S&P 500 and the EEI Utilities Index.”

Utilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy’s Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $2.08 per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2018, which was $0.26 per share higher than 2017. The primary drivers of higher GAAP EPS were higher margins due to Interstate Power and Light Company’s (IPL’s) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company’s (WPL’s) increasing rate base, higher retail electric and gas sales due to temperatures in 2018, and higher allowance for funds used during construction. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation expense.

Non-utility and Parent - Alliant Energy’s Non-utility and Parent operations generated $(0.01) per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2018, which was $0.07 per share lower than 2017. The primary drivers of lower EPS were higher interest expense and benefits of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Federal Tax Reform) in 2017. These items were partially offset by higher equity income in 2018 from the wind farm in Oklahoma due to accelerated earnings as a result of Federal Tax Reform, which is expected to reverse over time.

Earnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for 2018 excludes earnings of $0.02 per share related to Federal Tax Reform adjustments as a result of clarifying rules issued in 2018. Non-GAAP EPS for 2017 excludes the write-down of regulatory assets due to the IPL retail electric rate review settlement and the initial impacts of Federal Tax Reform. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.

Temperature Impacts to Non-GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations - The estimated net impact of temperatures on retail electric and gas sales was a $0.06 per share gain in 2018. The temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for fiscal year 2018 was $2.11. The estimated impact of temperatures on retail electric and gas sales was a $0.06 per share loss in 2017. The temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 was $1.99.

Details regarding GAAP EPS from continuing operations variances between 2018 and 2017 for Alliant Energy are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Higher margins primarily from earning on increasing rate base - In April 2017, IPL filed a request with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric customers. The request was based on a 2016 historical Test Year as adjusted for certain known and measurable changes occurring up to 12 months after the commencement of the proceeding. An interim retail electric rate increase of $102 million, on an annual basis, was implemented effective April 13, 2017. In February 2018, the IUB issued an order approving IPL’s settlement reached in September 2017, for an annual electric base rate increase of $130 million, or approximately 9%. Final rates were effective May 1, 2018.

In May 2018, IPL filed a request with the IUB to increase annual gas base rates for its Iowa retail gas customers. The request was based on 2017 historical Test Year as adjusted for certain known and measurable changes occurring up to 12 months after the commencement of the proceeding. An interim retail gas rate increase of $11 million, on an annual basis, was implemented effective May 14, 2018. In December 2018, the IUB issued an order approving IPL’s settlement reached in September 2018, for an annual gas base rate increase of $14 million, or approximately 6%. Final rates were effective January 17, 2019. IPL recognized $0.16 per share of higher electric and gas margins in 2018 due to the retail electric and gas rate increases.

In December 2016, WPL received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorizing WPL to implement a retail electric rate increase effective January 1, 2017 followed by a freeze of such rates through the end of 2018. To reflect the higher margins in 2018, primarily from earning on increasing rate base, the order lowered the amortization of amounts that WPL previously over-recovered from its customers for electric transmission cost recovery beginning in January 2018. WPL recognized $0.08 per share of higher electric margins in 2018 due to lower transmission cost recovery amortization.

Estimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales - Alliant Energy’s retail electric and gas sales increased in 2018 and decreased in 2017 largely due to impacts of temperatures on customer demand.

WPL’s retail electric and gas rate settlement includes an earnings sharing mechanism whereby WPL must defer a portion of its earnings and return this amount to its retail electric and gas customers if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 10.25% during 2018. As a result, a majority of the higher margins recognized at WPL as a result of the temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales in 2018 is currently expected to be returned to customers in the future.

A portion of Alliant Energy’s performance pay is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales is offset by higher performance pay expense. Alliant Energy’s estimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales, net of the WPL earnings sharing mechanism and the portion of performance pay associated with temperature impacts on earnings, is estimated to be a $0.06 per share increase in 2018 earnings. By comparison, the impact of temperatures in 2017 was estimated to be a $0.06 per share loss.

Tax adjustments due to Federal Tax Reform - The enactment of Federal Tax Reform had a material impact on the 2017 financial statements. The most significant provision of Federal Tax Reform was the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in December 2017. During the third quarter of 2018, additional rules were issued including clarifications of the treatment of bonus depreciation deductions. As a result of these clarifying rules, the impact of Federal Tax Reform was updated resulting in $0.02 per share of higher earnings in 2018.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy’s financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include the use of (1) income from continuing operations and EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 excluding the tax return adjustments due to Federal Tax Reform; and (2) income from continuing operations and EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 excluding the write-down of regulatory assets due to the IPL retail electric rate review settlement, and the initial impacts of Federal Tax Reform. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy’s management also uses income from continuing operations, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation.

In addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL; Corporate Services; Utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Holdings; and Non-utility and Parent EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.

This press release references year-over-year variances in utility electric margins and utility gas margins. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures that are reported and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, in our 2018 Form 10-K.

This press release also includes temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because the measure facilitates period-to-period comparison of Alliant Energy’s operating performance and provides investors with information on a basis consistent with measures that management uses to assess Alliant Energy’s earnings growth rate.

The tax impact adjustments represent the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the estimated consolidated statutory tax rate.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings summaries that follow, and in the case of temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations, in the press release above.

Note: Unless otherwise noted, all “per share” references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.
