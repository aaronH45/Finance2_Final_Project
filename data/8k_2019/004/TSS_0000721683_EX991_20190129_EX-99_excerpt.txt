 TSYS Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings  

 Provides 2019 Outlook for Revenue and Earnings per Share  

 Columbus, Ga., January 29, 2019 – TSYS (NYSE: TSS) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018.  

  “Strong results in the fourth quarter closed out another exceptional year for our company. In 2018, we delivered outstanding financial results, expanded our Merchant capabilities with the acquisition of Cayan and iMobile3, and continued to make strategic long-term investments across the enterprise,” said M. Troy Woods, chairman, president and chief executive officer of TSYS.   

 Highlights for the fourth quarter of 2018 vs. 2017:  

   ·    Total revenues were $1.02 billion, a decrease of 20.0%. The decrease is the result of adopting ASC 606.(1) 

   ·    Net revenue (non-GAAP), which excludes reimbursable items, interchange and payment network fees, was $959.3 million, an increase of 10.2%. 

   ·    Net income attributable to TSYS common shareholders was $136.4 million, a decrease of 43.7%. The decrease is the result of $135.9 million of tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 4Q 2017. Diluted EPS were $0.74, a decrease of 43.4%. 

   ·    Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) were $197.5 million, an increase of 30.8%. Adjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP) were $1.08, an increase of 31.5%. 

   ·    Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $346.0 million, an increase of 18.0%.

 Highlights for the full year of 2018 vs. 2017:  

   ·    Total revenues were $4.03 billion, a decrease of 18.3%. The decrease is the result of adopting ASC 606.(1) 

   ·    Net revenue (non-GAAP), which excludes reimbursable items, interchange and payment network fees, was $3.82 billion, an increase of 12.2%. 

   ·    Net income attributable to TSYS common shareholders was $576.7 million, a decrease of 1.6%. The decrease is the result of $135.9 million of tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 4Q 2017. Diluted EPS were $3.14, a decrease of 0.8%. 

   ·    Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) were $821.3 million, an increase of 31.6%. Adjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP) were $4.47, an increase of 32.7%. 

   ·    Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $1.37 billion, an increase of 14.4%. 

   (1)    On January 1, 2018, TSYS adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” using the modified retrospective transition method. The most significant impact of adopting ASC 606 in 2018 is primarily the result of gross versus net presentation of interchange and payment network fees. In 2018, these fees collected on behalf of the payment networks and card issuers are presented “net” of the amounts paid to them, as opposed to the “gross” presentation for certain of these fees in 2017.  

 2019 Outlook  

 TSYS’ 2019 guidance is as follows:

 Forward-Looking Statements   

 Page 4 of 18  

 This press release contains “forward-looking statements” – that is, statements related to future, not past, events. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “should,” “plan,” “potential,” “will,” “could,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding TSYS’ earnings guidance for 2019 total revenues, net revenue, diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS, and the assumptions underlying such statements. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of TSYS’ management, are based on management’s assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond TSYS’ ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to, the material breach of security of any of TSYS’ systems; TSYS’ ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve the anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits of the acquisitions, particularly the recently completed Cayan acquisition; the effect of current domestic and worldwide economic conditions; risks associated with foreign operations, including adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates, and in particular with respect to the current environment, adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union (Brexit);expenses incurred associated with the signing of a significant client; conversions and deconversions of clients’ portfolios do not occur as scheduled; the deconversion of a significant client; changes occur in laws, rules, regulations, credit card association rules, prepaid industry rules or other industry standards affecting TSYS and our clients that may result in costly new compliance burdens on TSYS and our clients and lead to a decrease in the volume and/or number of transactions processed or limit the types and amounts of fees that can be charged to customers, and in particular the CFPB’s new rule regarding prepaid financial products, including its effective date; the potential for our systems and software to contain undetected errors, viruses or defects; the costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters or adverse facts and developments relating thereto; adverse developments with respect to the payment card industry in general, including a decline in the use of cards as a payment mechanism; one or more of the assumptions upon which earnings guidance for 2019 is based is inaccurate; and growth rates of TSYS’ existing clients are lower than anticipated or attrition rates of existing clients are higher than anticipated. Additional risks and other factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated in this release can be found in TSYS’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. TSYS disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise except as required by law.

 Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 Non-GAAP Measures  

 The schedules below provide a reconciliation of revenues and operating results on a constant currency basis to reported revenues and operating income. This non-GAAP measure presents fourth quarter and year-to-date 2018 financial results using the previous year’s foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, TSYS’ total year-to-date revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 were lower 18.5% as compared to a reported GAAP decrease of 18.3%.  

 The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of total revenues to net revenue.  

 The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS.  

 The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA.  

 The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities and capital expenditures to free cash flow.   

 The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of 2019 guidance of total revenues to net revenue and diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS.   

 The tax rate used in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter and year is equal to an estimate of our annual effective tax rate on GAAP income. This effective rate is estimated annually and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events or trends that materially impact the effective tax rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in the mix of revenues and expenses by entity and other significant events.  

 TSYS believes that non-GAAP financial measures are important to enable investors to understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results. Accordingly, TSYS includes non-GAAP financial measures when reporting its financial results to shareholders and potential investors in order to provide them with an additional tool to evaluate TSYS’ ongoing business operations. TSYS believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are representative of comparative financial performance that reflects the economic substance of TSYS’ current and ongoing business operations.  

 Although non-GAAP financial measures are often used to measure TSYS’ operating results and assess its financial performance, they are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.  

 TSYS believes that its provision of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with important key financial performance indicators that are utilized by management to assess TSYS’ operating results, evaluate the business and make operational decisions on a prospective, going-forward basis. Hence, management provides disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures to give shareholders and potential investors an opportunity to see TSYS as viewed by management, to assess TSYS with some of the same tools that management utilizes internally and to be able to compare such information with prior periods. TSYS believes that inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional information to help them better understand its financial statements just as management utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures to better understand the business, manage budgets and allocate resources.
