Item 5.03.Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

Effective February 14, 2019, the Board of Directors of Mohawk Industries, Inc. (the “Company”) amended and restated the Company's By-Laws to implement a proxy access bylaw. The new bylaw permits, under certain circumstances, eligible stockholders owning 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate directors and include the nominees in the Company’s proxy materials. The proxy access rights are subject to additional requirements and limitations, as set forth in the amended Bylaws. The amended By-Laws also make clarifications, updates and other changes to the disclosure requirements and notice periods for director nominations and other stockholder proposals outside of the proxy access context. 

The foregoing descriptions of the bylaw amendments do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the amended Bylaws that are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

The documents included as exhibits to this report are filed solely to provide information about their terms, are not intended to provide any factual or other information about the Company or the other parties to the agreements, and should not be relied upon by investors for any other purpose.
