Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure 

On February 5, 2019, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (the “Company”) filed a Form 8-K in connection with its press release announcing financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018. The release also included the Company’s estimates related to its fiscal 2019 third quarter and full year net sales and diluted net earnings per common share. 

This Form 8-K corrects the range provided by the Company with regard to its fiscal 2019 full year projections for reported diluted net earnings per share as disclosed on pages 8 and 10 of its February 5, 2019 press release. In this regard, $4.55 - $4.67 should have been $4.47 - $4.59. The $.08 difference represents the impacts of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments and changes in contingent consideration, combined, and the finalization of the provisional charges for the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) of $.07 and $.01, respectively, which occurred in the first half of the fiscal year. 

The non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share range for fiscal 2019 full year ($4.92 - $5.00) remains the same and does not need to be corrected. 

The following reflects the correction and related clarifications to the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP:
