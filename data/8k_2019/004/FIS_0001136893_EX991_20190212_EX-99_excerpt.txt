JACKSONVILLE Fla., February 12, 2019 - FIS™ (NYSE:FIS), a global leader in financial services technology, today reported full-year and fourth quarter 2018 results. All financial results, calculations and year over year comparisons reflect the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606 (ASC 606) on a full retrospective basis. The comparability of the Company’s full-year results is impacted by the divestitures of its public sector and education business and consulting businesses in 2017, and its Kingstar business in China and its Certegy Check Services business in North America in 2018.

The Company paid dividends of $421 million for the full-year 2018 and $105 million for the fourth quarter 2018. 

Depreciation and Amortization Update

Historically, FIS has excluded the cost of amortization of purchase accounting intangibles from the calculation of its Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share non-GAAP measures (the “Prior Method”). In response to a recent comment letter from the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), FIS agreed that in the future it would exclude all depreciation and amortization, and not only amortization of purchase accounting intangibles, from those non-GAAP measures (the “New Method”).

Under the New Method, full-year 2018 adjusted net earnings attributable to common stockholders was $2,304 million, or $6.93 per diluted share, compared to $1,892 million, or $5.64 per diluted share for the prior year. Under the New Method, fourth quarter 2018 adjusted net earnings attributable to common stockholders was $681 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, compared to $538 million, or $1.60 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. The attached schedules include a reconciliation of results for the 2018 and 2017 periods under the New Method with those under the Prior Method (See Exhibit E).

Additionally, FIS will include footnote information in future earnings releases enabling a comparison of these measures as determined under the New Method with the measures as they would have been determined under the Prior Method.

Full-Year 2019 Guidance

Full-year 2019 Adjusted EPS guidance accounts for the change in our Adjusted EPS definition to the New Method described above, which now excludes all depreciation and amortization from its calculation.

2019 GAAP Guidance

•Consolidated GAAP revenue growth approximately flat

•Net earnings margin expansion of 350 to 450 bps

•Diluted EPS of $3.50 to $3.80

2019 Non-GAAP Guidance

•Consolidated organic revenue increase of 3.5 to 4.5 percent

•Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 150 to 200 bps

•Adjusted EPS of $7.35 to $7.55

Webcast

FIS will sponsor a live webcast of its earnings conference call with the investment community beginning at 8:30 a.m. (EDT) Tues., February 12, 2019. To access the webcast, go to the Investor Relations section of FIS’ homepage, www.fisglobal.com. A replay will be available after the conclusion of the live webcast.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures.

These non-GAAP measures include adjusted revenue, constant currency revenue, organic revenue increase/decrease, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net earnings (including per share amounts), adjusted cash flows from operations and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures may be used in this release and/or in the attached supplemental financial information.

We believe these non-GAAP measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals of our business. As further described below, the non-GAAP revenue and earnings measures presented eliminate items management believes are not indicative of FIS’ operating performance. The constant currency and organic revenue increase/decrease measures adjust for the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, while organic revenue increase/decrease also adjusts for acquisitions and divestitures, giving investors further insight into our performance. Finally, the non-GAAP cash flow measures provide further information about the ability of our business to generate cash. For these reasons, management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its assessment and management of FIS’ performance.

Adjusted revenue consists of revenue, increased to reverse the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment made upon the acquisition of SunGard. The deferred revenue adjustment represents revenue that would have been recognized in the normal course of business by SunGard under GAAP but was not recognized due to GAAP purchase accounting adjustments. The deferred revenue adjustment in purchase accounting was made entirely in the Corporate and Other segment; reported GAAP results for the IFS and GFS segments are not affected by this adjustment and, therefore, no adjusted revenue is presented for these segments.

Constant currency revenue represents (i) adjusted revenue, as defined above, in respect of the consolidated results and the Corporate and Other segment and (ii) reported revenue in respect of the IFS and GFS segments, in each case excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the current period.

Organic revenue increase/decrease is constant currency revenue, as defined above, for the current period compared to an adjusted revenue base for the prior period, which is further adjusted to add pre-acquisition revenue of acquired businesses for a portion of the prior year matching the portion of the current year for which the business was owned, and subtract pre-divestiture revenue for divested businesses for the portion of the prior year matching the portion of the current year for which the business was not owned, for any acquisitions or divestitures by FIS.

EBITDA reflects earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA, as defined above, excluding certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods. This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.

Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted revenue.

Adjusted net earnings (New Method) excludes the impact of certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods. It also excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization and equity method investment earnings (loss), both of which are recurring. We began excluding the equity method investment earnings (loss) impact in 2018, but have not excluded it from the comparative 2017 amounts as it was insignificant.

Adjusted net earnings (Prior Method) excludes the impact of certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods. It also excludes the impact of acquisition-related purchase accounting amortization and equity method investment earnings (loss), both of which are recurring. We began excluding the equity method investment earnings (loss) impact in 2018, but have not excluded it from the comparative 2017 amounts as it was insignificant.

Adjusted net earnings per diluted share, or Adjusted EPS (New Method), reflects adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (New Method) divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

Adjusted net earnings per diluted share, or Adjusted EPS (Prior Method), reflects adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (Prior Method) divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

Adjusted cash flows from operations reflect net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations and exclude certain transactions that are closely associated with non-operating activities or are otherwise non-operational in nature and not indicative of future operating cash flows.

Free cash flow reflects adjusted cash flows from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure.

Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Further, FIS’ non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures, including footnotes describing the specific adjustments, are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS website, www.fisglobal.com.

(1a)This item represents the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. The Company has excluded the impact of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles as such amounts can be significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Although the Company excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP expenses, the Company believes that it is important for investors to understand that such tangible and intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Depreciation and amortization of assets, including those that relate to past acquisitions, will recur in future periods until such assets have been fully depreciated or amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the depreciation and/or amortization of future assets. Within the depreciation and amortization item, $178 million and $164 million for the three months and $688 million and $636 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, consist of depreciation and amortization of non-purchase accounting assets. The tax effects related to depreciation and amortization of non-purchase accounting assets are $23 million and $45 million for the three months and $121 million and $177 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The adjustments are as follows:

(1a)This item represents the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. The Company has excluded the impact of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles as such amounts can be significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Although the Company excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP expenses, the Company believes that it is important for investors to understand that such tangible and intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Depreciation and amortization of assets, including those that relate to past acquisitions, will recur in future periods until such assets have been fully depreciated or amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the depreciation and/or amortization of future assets. Within the depreciation and amortization item, $178 million and $164 million for the three months and $688 million and $636 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, consist of depreciation and amortization of non-purchase accounting assets. The tax effects related to depreciation and amortization of non-purchase accounting assets are $23 million and $45 million for the three months and $121 million and $177 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

(4)This item represents the impact of the purchase accounting adjustment to reduce SunGard's deferred revenues to estimated fair value, determined as fulfillment cost plus a normal profit margin. The deferred revenue adjustment represents revenue that would have been recognized in the normal course of business by SunGard under GAAP if the acquisition had not occurred, but was not recognized due to GAAP purchase accounting requirements. 

(5)This item represents the net pre-tax loss (gain) on sale of businesses and investments during 2018, the pre-tax gain on the sale of PS&E businesses and other divestitures during the first quarter of 2017 and the pre-tax loss on the sale of the Capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business ("Capco") during the third quarter of 2017.
