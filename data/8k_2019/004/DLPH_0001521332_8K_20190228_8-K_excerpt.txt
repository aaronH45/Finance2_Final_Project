On February 28, 2019, Aptiv PLC (the "Company" or “Aptiv”), announced that it intends to redeem for cash the entire $650 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Company’s 3.15% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). The 2020 Notes are redeemable at a redemption price that includes a make-whole premium, plus any interest accrued and unpaid to the redemption date. The redemption is expected to occur on March 15, 2019, subject to satisfaction or waiver by the Company of the condition described below.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those related to the financing and completion of the redemption and the completion of the offering of the new financing described herein. These forward-looking statements reflect, when made, Aptiv's current views with respect to current events and the proposed redemption and new financing. Such forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and factors relating to Aptiv's operations and business environment as well as market conditions, which may cause Aptiv’s actual results to be materially different from any future results, express or implied, by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are discussed under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Aptiv's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for Aptiv to predict these events or how they may affect Aptiv. Aptiv disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events and/or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
