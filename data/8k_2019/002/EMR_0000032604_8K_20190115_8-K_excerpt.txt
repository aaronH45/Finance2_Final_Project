Other Events.  

On January 15, 2019, Emerson Electric Co. (the “Company”) completed its previously announced public offering of €500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.250% Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and €500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2.000% Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes” and, together with the 2025 Notes, the “Notes”). The pricing of the Notes was previously announced in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 10, 2019.  

The Company expects the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to be approximately €988.4 million (or approximately $1.127 billion) before deducting estimated expenses of the offering. The Company expects to use the net proceeds primarily to repay its commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Prior to maturity, the Company may redeem any or all of the Notes at any time at the redemption prices described in the Notes. The Notes are required to be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.  

The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of December 10, 1998 (the “Original Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (successor to The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York)), as trustee (the “Original Trustee”), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 15, 2019 (the “First Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Original Indenture, the “Indenture”) among the Company, the Original Trustee and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as series trustee with respect to the Notes. Pursuant to an Agency Agreement dated as of January 15, 2019 (the “Agency Agreement”) relating to the Notes, the Company has appointed Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch to act as paying agent for the Notes and U.S. Bank National Association to act as registrar and transfer agent for the Notes. Wells Fargo Securities International Limited is an underwriter in the offering and is an affiliate of the series trustee.  

The offering of the Notes was made pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-221668), the prospectus dated November 20, 2017, and the related prospectus supplement dated January 8, 2019. This Current Report on Form 8-K adds exhibits to that Registration Statement.  

The above description of the Notes, the Indenture and the Agency Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture, the forms of Notes and the Agency Agreement, each of which is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. The Original Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture, the Agency Agreement and the 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
