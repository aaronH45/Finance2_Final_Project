These forward - looking statements, which are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which MAA operates and beliefs of and assumptions made by MAA management, involve uncertainties that could significantly affect the financial results of MAA . Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward - looking statements, which are not historical in nature . In this presentation, forward - looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about forecasted operating results, anticipated revenue and expense growth, expected acquisition and disposition activity, the outlook for new multifamily supply, expected benefits and synergies from the merger with Post Properties , anticipated occupancy rates , anticipated lease pricing, estimated development funding, the anticipated timing of completion of current development projects and the stabilization of such projects, MAA’s future development projects, the anticipated stabilization of communities in lease - up, the anticipated scope of MAA’s future redevelopment activities and projected redevelopment costs, incremental rent growth and incremental revenue, interest rate and other economic expectations, and other information that is not historical . All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that MAA anticipates or expects will occur in the future are forward - looking statements . These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict . Although MAA believes the expectations reflected in any forward - looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, MAA can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved, and therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward - looking statements . Some of the factors that may affect outcomes and results include, but are not limited to : inability to generate sufficient cash flows due to market conditions, changes in supply and/or demand, competition, uninsured losses, changes in tax and housing laws, or other factors ; exposure as a multifamily - focused REIT to risks inherent in investments in a single industry and sector ; adverse changes in real estate markets ; failure of new acquisitions to achieve anticipated results or be efficiently integrated ; failure of development communities to be completed, if at all, within budget and on a timely basis or to lease - up as anticipated ; unexpected capital needs ; changes in operating costs, including real estate taxes, utilities and insurance costs ; losses from catastrophes in excess of our insurance coverage ; level and volatility of interest or capitalization rates or capital market conditions ; the effect of any rating agency actions ; inability to attract and retain qualified personnel ; cyberliability or potential liability for breaches of our privacy or information security systems ; adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes ; adverse legal proceedings ; compliance costs associated with laws requiring access for disabled persons ; and those additional risks and factors discussed in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by MAA from time to time, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in MAA’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10 - K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10 - Q . MAA undertakes no duty to update any forward - looking statements appearing in this presentation . REGULATION G This presentation contains certain non - GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended .

DEFINITIONS OF NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted EBITDA re For purposes of calculations in this presentation, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate, or Adjusted EBITDA re , is composed of EBITDA re adjusted for net gain or loss on non - depreciable asset sales, insurance and other settlement proceeds, and gain or loss on debt extinguishment. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers Adjusted EBITDA re to be an important measure of performance from core operations because Adjusted EBITDA re does not include various income and expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. MAA's computation of Adj us ted EBITDA re may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate Adjusted EBITDA re . Adjusted EBITDA re should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of financial performance. Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) AFFO is composed of FFO less recurring capital expenditures. In order to better align the classification of capital expenditu res with business goals, certain capital expenditures related to commercial properties have been reclassified out of recurring capital expenditures for comparative pu rpo ses. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA consider s A FFO to be an important measure of performance from operations because AFFO measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and recurring capital expenditure s. EBITDA For purposes of calculations in this presentation, Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or EBITDA, is composed of net income plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income taxes. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers EB ITD A to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDA does not include various expense items that are not indicative of operating p erf ormance. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of financial performance. EBITDA re For purposes of calculations in this presentation, Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate, or EBITDA re , is composed of EBITDA, as defined above, excluding the gain or loss on sale of depreciable asset sales and plus adjustments to reflect MAA's sh are of EBITDA re of unconsolidated affiliates. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers EBITDA re to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDA re does not include various expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. While MAA's definition of EBITDA re is in accordance with NAREIT's definition, it may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate EBITDA re . EBITDA re should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of financial performance . Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) FAD is composed of FFO less total capital expenditures, excluding development spending and property acquisitions. FAD should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers FAD to be an import ant measure of performance from core operations because FAD measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and total capital expenditures. 28  

DEFINITIONS OF NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Funds From Operations (FFO) FFO represents net income available for MAA common shareholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding extraordinary it ems , asset impairment and gains or losses on disposition of operating properties, plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, depreciation and amortization of operating properties, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. Because noncontrolling interest is added back, FFO, when used in this document, represents FFO attributable to the Company. While MAA's definition of FFO is in accordance with the NAREIT's definition, it may differ from th e methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other companies. FFO should not be considered as an alter nat ive to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. MAA believes that FFO is helpful in understanding operatin g p erformance in that FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. MAA believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate asse ts is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Gross Assets Gross Assets represents Total assets plus Accumulated depreciation and accumulated depreciation for Assets held for sale, whi ch is included in "Assets held for sale" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. MAA believes that Gross Assets can be used as a helpful tool in evaluating its balance s hee t positions. MAA believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, who se value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Gross Real Estate Assets Gross Real Estate Assets represents Real estate assets, net plus Accumulated depreciation and accumulated depreciation for As set s held for sale, which is included in "Assets held for sale" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, plus Cash and cash equivalents plus 1031(b) exchange proceeds incl ude d in "Restricted cash" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. MAA believes that Gross Real Estate Assets can be used as a helpful tool in evaluating its bala nce sheet positions. MAA believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets , w hose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies . Net Debt Net Debt represents Unsecured notes payable and Secured notes payable less Cash and cash equivalents and 1031(b) proceeds inc lud ed in "Restricted cash" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. MAA believes Net Debt is a helpful tool in evaluating its debt position. Net Operating Income (NOI) Net Operating Income represents Rental and other property revenues less Total property operating expenses, excluding deprecia tio n, for all properties held during the period, regardless of their status as held for sale. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available f or MAA common shareholders. MAA believes NOI by market is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance within MAA's markets because it measures the core ope rat ions of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance. 29  

DEFINITIONS OF NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Recurring Adjusted EBITDA re Recurring Adjusted EBITDA re represents Adjusted EBITDA re further adjusted to exclude certain items that are not considered part of MAA's core business operations such as acquisition and merger and integration expenses. MAA believes Recurring Adjusted EBITDA re is an important performance measure as it adjusts for certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance. MAA's de finition of Recurring Adjusted EBITDA re may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate Recurring Adjusted EBITDA re . Recurring Adjusted EBITDA re should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. Same Store NOI Same Store NOI represents total operating revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, for all pr ope rties classified within the Same Store Portfolio during the period. Same Store NOI should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common sh areholders. MAA believes Same Store NOI is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance within MAA's markets because it measures the core operati ons of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance . 30  

DEFINITIONS OF OTHER KEY TERMS Average Effective Rent per Unit Average Effective Rent per Unit represents the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occu pie d units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current mark et rate. MAA believes average effective rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. It does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. Average Physical Occupancy Average Physical Occupancy represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the quarter. Development Communities Communities remain identified as development until certificates of occupancy are obtained for all units under development. On ce all units are delivered and available for occupancy, the community moves into the Lease - up Communities portfolio. Lease - up Communities New acquisitions acquired during lease - up and newly developed communities remain in the Lease - up Communities portfolio until sta bilized. Communities are considered stabilized after achieving at least 90% occupancy for 90 days. Non - Same Store Portfolio Non - Same Store Portfolio includes recent acquisitions, communities that have been identified for disposition, and communities th at have undergone a significant casualty loss. Same Store Portfolio MAA reviews its Same Store Portfolio at the beginning of each calendar year, or as significant transactions warrant. Communit ies are generally added into the Same Store Portfolio if they were owned and stabilized at the beginning of the previous year. Communities are considered stabiliz ed after achieving at least 90% occupancy for 90 days. Communities that have been approved by MAA's Board of Directors for disposition are excluded from the Same Store Po rtfolio. Communities that have undergone a significant casualty loss are also excluded from the Same Store Portfolio . Total Market Capitalization Total Market Capitalization equals the number of shares of common stock plus units not held by MAA at period end multiplied b y t he closing stock price at period end, plus total debt outstanding.
