ITEM 8.01. Other Events.

On February 3, 2019, the Board of Directors of Aimco declared a special dividend payable to holders of Aimco's common stock that consists of $67.1 million in cash and 4.5 million shares of common stock. The special dividend will be payable on March 22, 2019, to stockholders of record as of February 22, 2019. Stockholders will have the option to elect to receive payment of the special dividend in cash or shares, subject to customary proration. Based on the closing price of $49.07 per share of Aimco common stock on February 1, 2019, the aggregate value of the special dividend is estimated to be approximately $287.9 million, or $1.93 per share. The actual value will vary depending on the price of Aimco common stock on the dividend valuation dates (March 11 and 12, 2019). Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Election materials will be sent to stockholders of record promptly after February 22, 2019. Stockholders who fail to return a properly completed election form before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on March 8, 2019, will be deemed to have made an election to receive the special dividend in cash. 

On February 3, 2019, the Board of Directors of Aimco also authorized a reverse stock split, effective on February 20, 2019. The split ratio for the reverse stock split will be determined at a later date, but is intended to neutralize the dilutive impact of the stock issued in the special dividend. Total shares of Aimco common stock outstanding following completion of both the special dividend and the reverse stock split are expected to be unchanged from the total shares outstanding immediately prior to the dividend. Some stockholders may have more Aimco shares and some may have fewer based on their individual elections.
