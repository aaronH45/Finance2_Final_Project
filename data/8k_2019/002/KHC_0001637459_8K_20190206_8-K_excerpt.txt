On February 6, 2019, Mr. Marcel Herrmann Telles informed Kraft Heinz that he will not stand for re-election as a director at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders due to time constraints from other commitments. His term of office as a director will expire at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Mr. Telles's decision not to stand for re-election is not the result of any disagreement with management or the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Kraft Heinz related to our operations, policies, or practices.

Kraft Heinz also announced today that the Board intends to keep the same number of directors and to nominate Daniel S. Schwartz to stand for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
