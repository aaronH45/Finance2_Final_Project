for the Fourth Quarter 2018 

LAKE FOREST, Ill., February 28, 2019 - Stericycle, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRCL) today reported results for the fourth quarter 2018. 

FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR: 

•  

Revenues were $852.7 million, a decrease of 4.0%; organic revenues decreased 1.1%, reflecting 13.8% organic growth in Secure Information Destruction, offset by the expected declines in the small quantity (“SQ”) medical waste business and Communication and Related Services (“CRS”). 

•  

Gross profit was $328.7 million, a decrease of 4.4%, due to non-cash impairment charges; Adjusted gross profit was $346.6 million, a 0.4% increase, in part due to growth in Secure Information Destruction.  

•  

Loss per share (“EPS”) was $3.51, due to non-cash goodwill impairment charges and other adjusting items; Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”) was $1.03, an increase of 3.0%, primarily driven by tax reform favorability offset by higher interest expense. 

•  

The Business Transformation remains on track for the planned 2020 ERP implementation in the U.S. and Canada, with 2019 focused on the building, testing and training phases; the Company continues to make progress on portfolio rationalization.

FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS 

Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 were $852.7 million, a decrease of 4.0% from $887.8 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenues by $21.4 million. Acquisitions contributed $6.8 million to revenues, and divestitures reduced revenues by $10.4 million. Organic revenues decreased 1.1%, driven by the expected declines in the SQ medical waste business and CRS, partially offset by strong organic growth in Secure Information Destruction. See Tables 1-A and 1-C. 

“Our performance in the quarter was in line with our expectations, with strength in our core Secure Information Destruction business and positive momentum in the regulated medical waste business,” said Charles A. Alutto, Chief Executive Officer.  

Gross profit was $328.7 million, a decrease of 4.4% from $344.0 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 38.5% compared to 38.7% in the fourth quarter of last year, which decreased primarily due to non-cash impairment charges. Adjusted gross profit was $346.6 million, a 0.4% increase. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 40.6% compared to 38.9% in the fourth quarter of last year, in part due to Secure Information Destruction growth and depreciation. See Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Table 2-A. 

Loss per share was $3.51 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.97 in the fourth quarter of last year, predominately due to non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to CRS and Latin America, and other adjusting items. Adjusted EPS increased 3.0% to $1.03 from $1.00 in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily driven by tax reform favorability offset by higher interest expense. See Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Table 2-A.

CASH FLOW 

Cash flow from operations for the year ended 2018 was $165.7 million, down 67.4% from $508.6 million last year, primarily as a result of the $295.0 million SQ customer class action settlement payment in the third quarter of 2018. The Company made net repayments on its borrowings of $9.7 million and generated $25.2 million from divestitures of businesses for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash from operations and divestitures of businesses was primarily allocated as follows: $130.8 million for capital expenditures, $44.7 million for acquisitions, and $17.2 million for repurchases of preferred stock. 

BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION 

During the fourth quarter, Stericycle continued to execute its Business Transformation to improve long-term operational and financial performance. The Company is now in the build phase of the ERP system, which will continue through the first half of 2019. 

Portfolio Rationalization remains a core tenet of the Business Transformation, and the Company continues to pursue strategic alternatives for the CRS business and other non-core assets and geographies. Today, the Company announced that it has closed on the divesture of the U.K.-based texting business, which had been part of CRS. 

“Our Business Transformation, including portfolio rationalization, continues to be a priority for 2019. Throughout the year, our team will be focused on the build, test and train phases of the ERP to ensure a successful implementation in the U.S. and Canada in 2020, followed by the international rollout beginning in 2021,” said Cindy J. Miller, President and Chief Operating Officer. 

In 2018, Stericycle realized Adjusted EBITDA benefits from Business Transformation initiatives of $64.0 million, in line with its 2018 target of $60-$65 million. 

In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded Business Transformation charges of $17.7 million, including $2.0 million of non-cash impairment charges, and capital expenditure payments of $9.8  

3 

million. For the full year, the Company has recorded charges of $82.6 million, inclusive of $9.1 million in non-cash impairment charges, and capital expenditure payments of $18.0 million. The aggregate annual cash spend was $91.5 million, below the Company’s estimate of $95-$105 million for 2018. 

LEADERSHIP UPDATES 

In a separate press release issued today, the Company announced that Ms. Miller has been named President and CEO, effective May 2, 2019, and that Mr. Alutto will retire as CEO, also effective at that time. In addition, Daniel V. Ginnetti, the Company’s CFO, will transition to the role of Executive Vice President of International following the appointment of a new CFO. 

Additionally, as part of its ongoing efforts to ensure the Company has the skills and expertise necessary to drive performance and execute the Business Transformation, Stericycle has recently added three new executives to its leadership team. 

William J. Seward joined the executive team in the newly created role of Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Seward brings more than 28 years of sales and marketing expertise to the Company, including extensive international experience growing multibillion service lines. He will lead global strategic planning and bring additional focus and discipline to revenue growth, marketing and brand management, and sales execution. 

Richard M. Moore joined Stericycle as Executive Vice President, North American Operations. Mr. Moore has 30 years of domestic and international experience executing on strategic plans, driving operational and productivity improvements, and improving safety and service results. Leading North American Operations, he will have responsibility for the development and execution of operational strategies that will optimize the network and facility operations and increase efficiencies. 

Joseph A. Reuter joined Stericycle as Chief People Officer. Mr. Reuter has nearly 30 years of experience in the human resources field including international assignments and management of global human resources. He brings a comprehensive set of skills and experiences to our  

4 

organization, including implementation of human capital processes and technology, and will play a critical role in advancing the Company’s human resource management and safety culture during the Company’s Business Transformation. 

FINANCIAL GUIDANCE 

Recently, the Stericycle leadership team reevaluated its guidance practices and how the Company will provide key performance indicators that can be more accurately predicted, enhancing the quality of our guidance estimates. The Company considered a variety of factors including its long-term strategy, ongoing Business Transformation, portfolio rationalization efforts, planned ERP implementation, and leadership changes. The Company believes the metrics selected most appropriately reflect its measurement of financial performance. 

Quarter to quarter, the Company will continue to provide quantitative updates on the performance of its service lines as well as qualitative insights on how various scenarios may impact future earnings so that stakeholders have appropriate information with which to measure progress. 

Stericycle today provided financial guidance for the full-year 2019, as summarized in the following table: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is Income from operations excluding certain adjusting items, Depreciation and Intangible Amortization. 

(b) Guidance presented is on an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis because it is not possible to predict or provide without unreasonable effort a reconciliation reflecting the impact of future acquisitions, divestitures, certain litigation, settlements and regulatory compliance matters, business transformation, intangible amortization, operational optimization, certain other items or the impact of highly inflationary accounting on operations in Argentina or other unanticipated events, which would be included in reported (GAAP) results and could be material. 

5 

The Company’s guidance is based on currently known items and certain business assumptions including using current foreign exchange rates. The guidance only includes acquisitions and divestitures completed through year end 2018.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT 

This document may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control (for example, general economic and market conditions). In particular, statements pertaining to our acquisition activity, business transformation, future dividend policy, capital expenditures, cost savings initiatives and remediation efforts with respect to identified material weaknesses contain forward-looking statements. When we use words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates" or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ significantly from the results described here. Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, the level of government enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, decreases in the volume of regulated wastes or personal and confidential information collected from customers, the ability to implement our ERP or execute on Business Transformation initiatives and achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings, charges related to the portfolio rationalization strategy or the failure of this strategy to achieve the desired results, failure to consummate a strategic alternative transaction with respect to Communication and Related Services or other non-core businesses, potential charges related to a strategic alternative transaction with respect to Communication and Related Services, or the failure of any such transaction to achieve desired results, the obligations to service substantial indebtedness and comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in private placement notes and credit agreements, political, economic, inflationary, currency and other risks related to our foreign operations, the outcome of pending or future litigation including litigation with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, changing market conditions in the healthcare industry, competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries, changes in the demand and price for recycled paper, failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, delays in implementing remediation efforts with respect to existing material weakness, identification of additional material weaknesses, failure of current remediation efforts to address existing material weaknesses, disruptions in or attacks on information technology systems, as well as other factors described in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. To the extent permitted under applicable law, we make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.

RECONCILIATION OF U.S. GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (UNAUDITED)

Table 1 – C: DISAGGREGATED REVENUES CHANGE 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) The comparisons at constant currency rates (foreign exchange) reflect comparative local currency balances at prior period’s foreign exchange rates. Stericycle calculated these percentages by taking current period reported Revenues less the respective prior period reported Revenues, divided by the prior period reported Revenues, all at the respective prior period’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in Revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period. Management believes the use of this measure aids in the understanding of changes in Revenues without the impact of foreign currency. 

(b) Manufacturing and Industrial Services (“M&I”) is a customer subset prevalent in our Environmental Solutions business as well as some international markets. M&I has historically experienced greater volatility in Revenues from period-to-period due to more pervasive market movements in customer industrial sectors such as oil and energy and the nature and timing of customer project work. As a result, management believes it is meaningful to present Revenues with and without M&I Revenues as this aids in the understanding of changes in Revenues without the impact of a more volatile aspect of the business. 

We believe these measures provide greater transparency into Stericycle’s Revenues and related results of operations. Management uses these measures internally to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. These measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

We also recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $358.7 million of which $286.3 million related to Domestic CRS and $72.4 million related to Latin America reporting units.

2017: SG&A includes $7.5 million of consulting and professional services related to the implementation of new accounting standards as well as internal control remediation activities. 

(9) Capital Allocation 

2017 includes dividends on our Series A mandatory convertible preferred stock of $8.8 million. 

For the purpose of calculating the ultimate EPS impact of our mandatory convertible preferred stock, prior to its conversion into common stock, we show the impact by excluding the mandatory convertible preferred stock dividend and using the “if-converted”  

13 

method of share dilution. This provides insight to how our diluted share count was affected by the potential conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred shares prior to their actual conversion in September 2018.  

As a result of this conversion in September 2018, the preferred stock had no impact on Adjusted Diluted EPS or the diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2018. The impact of excluding the preferred stock dividend from Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.10 for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in diluted shares outstanding under the “if-converted” method was 5.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. 

The impact of all adjusting items under the “if-converted” method to our Adjusted Diluted EPS has a dilutive effect of $0.05 for the fourth quarter of 2017. 

(10) Tax Reform 

2018: Income tax benefit includes a $8.4 million charge arising from measurement period adjustments related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”). 

2017: Income tax benefit includes a $129.8 million credit from the provisional recognition of the impact of the Tax Act. 

(a) The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release are reconciled to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the schedules attached to this release. Management believes the Non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of Stericycle’s performance because they provide additional information about Stericycle’s operations and exclude certain adjusting items, allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Additionally, the Company uses such Non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating business unit and management performance. All Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to, or calculated in the same manner as Non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies. 

(b) (Loss) Income from Operations and Adjusted Income from Operations provide the basis for other financial measures. 

(c) Under the Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Common Shareholders column, adjustments are shown net of tax in aggregate of $90.3 million and $46.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, based on applying the statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the adjustment occurred or, by adjusting the tax effect to consider the impact of applying an annual effective tax rate on an interim basis.

(a) The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release are reconciled to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the schedules attached to this release. Management believes the Non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of Stericycle’s performance because they provide additional information about Stericycle’s operations and exclude certain adjusting items, allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Additionally, the Company uses such Non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating business unit and management performance. All Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to, or calculated in the same manner as Non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies. 

(b) (Loss) Income from Operations and Adjusted Income from Operations provide the basis for other financial measures. 

(c) Under the Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Common Shareholders column, adjustments are shown net of tax in aggregate of $164.7 million and $225.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, based on applying the statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the adjustment occurred. 

(d) EPS calculated on a quarterly basis, and, as such, the amounts may not total the calculated full-year EPS.
