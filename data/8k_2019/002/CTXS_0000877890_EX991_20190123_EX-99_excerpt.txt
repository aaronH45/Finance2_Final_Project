 FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 23, 2019--Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  

 Financial Results  

 For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, Citrix achieved revenue of $802 million, compared to $778 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, representing 3 percent revenue growth. For fiscal year 2018, Citrix reported annual revenue of $2.97 billion, compared to $2.82 billion for fiscal year 2017, a 5 percent increase.  

 GAAP Results  

 Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $166 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $284 million, or $1.93 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Net income (loss) for the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 includes restructuring charges of $4 million and $54 million, respectively, for severance and facility closing costs. Net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 includes charges for the estimated impact from the enactment of U.S. tax reform related to the transition tax on accumulated overseas profits and the reduction of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the U.S. federal tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%. Approximately $364 million in tax expense was recorded for transition tax on foreign earnings and profits, and approximately $65 million in tax expense was recorded related to the reduction of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in total charges of $429 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.  

 Annual net income for fiscal year 2018 was $576 million, or $3.94 per diluted share, compared to $22 million, or $0.14 per diluted share for fiscal year 2017. Net income for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 includes restructuring charges of $17 million and $72 million, respectively, for severance and facility closing costs. Annual net income for fiscal year 2018 also includes a $27 million benefit related to adjustments in our estimates of the one-time effects of U.S. tax reform. Annual net income for fiscal year 2017 also includes $429 million in charges for the estimated impact from the enactment of U.S. tax reform related to the transition tax on accumulated overseas profits and the reduction of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  

 Non-GAAP Results  

 Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $232 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, compared to $248 million, or $1.66 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt discount, restructuring charges and the tax effects related to these items. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 also excludes the tax impact related to the separation of the GoTo business along with charges for the estimated impact from the enactment of U.S. tax reform related to the transition tax on accumulated overseas profits and the reduction of our US deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the U.S. federal tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 also reflects the anti-dilutive impact of the company’s convertible note hedges.  

 Annual non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2018 was $791 million, or $5.65 per diluted share, compared to $744 million, or $4.85 per diluted share for fiscal year 2017. Annual non-GAAP net income for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt discount, restructuring charges, and the tax effects related to these items. Annual non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2018 excludes a benefit related to adjustments in our estimates of the one-time effects of U.S. tax reform. Annual non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2017 also excludes costs related to the separation of the GoTo business and related tax impacts along with charges for the estimated impact from U.S. tax reform related to the transition tax and the reduction of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 also reflects the anti-dilutive impact of the company’s convertible note hedges.  

 In addition to financial results, Citrix also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share payable on March 22, 2019 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 8, 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2018, Citrix repurchased $380 million of shares, completing its commitment from the fourth quarter of 2017 to return $2 billion to shareholders, and further returned $47 million to shareholders through its inaugural quarterly dividend.  

 “I am very pleased with our strong fourth quarter and full year results. All of our key performance metrics came in at or above the targets we provided. More importantly, our subscription model transition accelerated,” said David Henshall, president and CEO.  

 “Today, I believe we have the best product portfolio we’ve ever had and our long-term vision is resonating with both customers and with partners. The opportunities we see in both Digital Workspace and Networking combined with the investments we are making in the business give me confidence in Citrix’s outlook in the years ahead.”

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures

(Unaudited)  

 Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to intangible assets and debt discount, stock-based compensation expenses and charges associated with the Company’s restructuring programs, separation costs, the related tax effect of those items, charges or benefits related to the implementation of U.S. tax reform and separation-related tax charges. The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The Company also reflects the effect of anti-dilutive convertible note hedges in the number of shares used in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.  

 Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.  

 Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:   

 The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.  

 Amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  

 Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.  

 Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be accounted for as separate liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance because management believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.   

 The Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs. Each restructuring activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. While the Company’s operations previously benefited from the employees and facilities covered by the various restructuring charges, these employees and facilities have benefited different parts of the Company’s business in different ways, and the amount of these charges has varied significantly from period to period. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.  

 Separation costs represent transaction and transition costs associated with preparing businesses for independent operations consisting primarily of financial advisory fees, legal fees, accounting fees, tax services and information systems infrastructure duplication. These charges are not anticipated to be ongoing costs; and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. As such, the Company believes that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred.  

 The Company has convertible note hedges in place to offset potential dilution from the embedded conversion feature in its convertible notes. For GAAP diluted earnings per share purposes, the Company cannot reflect the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedges. The Company believes that reflecting the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedges in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share provides investors with useful information in evaluating the financial performance of the Company on a per share basis.  

 Separation-related tax charges or benefits, which may include reversals of certain state R&D credits due to changes in expectations of realizability as a result of the separation of a significant business of the Company. The Company believes that these items do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred.  

 Tax charges or benefits resulting from the enactment of U.S. tax reform are not anticipated to be ongoing costs; and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company’s business. Therefore, the Company believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.   

 These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity.
