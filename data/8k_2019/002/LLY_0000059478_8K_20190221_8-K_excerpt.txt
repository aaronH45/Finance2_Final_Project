The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture (the “Indenture”), dated February 1, 1991, between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as successor to Citibank, N.A., as trustee, and an officer’s certificate setting forth the terms of the Notes (which includes the forms of Notes as exhibits). The offering of the Notes was registered on a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-229735). The 2029 Notes will accrue interest at a rate of 3.375% per annum, payable semiannually, and will mature on March 15, 2029. The 2039 Notes will accrue interest at a rate of 3.875% per annum, payable semiannually, and will mature on March 15, 2039.

Upon the closing of the offering of the Notes, which is expected to occur on February 22, 2019, the Company will realize, after deduction of the underwriter’s discount and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $4.45 billion.

Upon occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to a series of Notes, the principal amount of the Notes of that series may be declared and become due and payable immediately. The Company may, at its election, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, from time to time at the redemption prices and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Notes. The above description of the Underwriting Agreement and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, the officers’ certificate, the Indenture and the forms of the Notes filed as exhibits hereto, which exhibits are incorporated by reference herein.
