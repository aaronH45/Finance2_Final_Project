Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On January 24, 2019, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Conagra Brands, Inc. (the “Company”) approved, effective as of February 16, 2019, an increase in the size of the Board from ten directors to eleven directors and appointed Scott Ostfeld as a director of the Company to fill the newly-created vacancy and to serve until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal. Mr. Ostfeld will also serve as a member of the Human Resources Committee of the Board.  

The Board has determined that Mr. Ostfeld satisfies the definition of “independent director” under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the categorical independence standards contained in the Company’s Corporate Governance Principles.  

As a non-employee director, Mr. Ostfeld will receive compensation in the same manner as the Company’s other non-employee directors. Mr. Ostfeld will receive compensation for services during fiscal 2019 of (i) a cash retainer representing a prorated portion of the annual cash retainer provided to non-employee directors, and (ii) a prorated portion of the annual equity award provided to non-employee directors. Accordingly, on January 24, 2019, the Board approved restricted stock units (the “RSUs”) with a value equal to $50,000 to be granted to Mr. Ostfeld on March 1, 2019 (the “Grant Date”), with the number of RSUs being determined by dividing $50,000 by the average of the closing stock price of the Company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the thirty (30) trading days prior to (and not including) the Grant Date, and rounding to the nearest share. In addition to the retainer and equity award, Mr. Ostfeld is eligible to participate in the other non-employee director compensation arrangements described in the Company’s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed on August 9, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With the approval of the Board, Mr. Ostfeld has assigned his compensation for Board services to JANA Partners LLC.
