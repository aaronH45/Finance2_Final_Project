INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT 

ITEM 8.01.Other Events 

On January 29, 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (“PG&E”) filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Subsidiaries of Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (“Con Edison Development”), a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (“Con Edison”), sell the output of their renewable electric production projects with an aggregate of 680 MW (AC) of generating capacity (“PG&E Projects”) to PG&E under long-term power purchase agreements (“PG&E PPAs”). Most of the PG&E PPAs have contract prices that are higher than estimated market prices. At December 31, 2018, Con Edison’s consolidated balance sheet included $829 million of net non-utility plant relating to the PG&E Projects, $1,234 million of intangible assets relating to the PG&E PPAs and $1,050 million of related project debt. PG&E, as a debtor in possession, may assume or reject the PG&E PPAs, subject to review by the bankruptcy court or, pursuant to a January 2019 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) order (which PG&E is challenging), the bankruptcy court and FERC. The PG&E bankruptcy is an event of default under the PG&E PPAs. Unless the lenders for the related project debt otherwise agree, distributions from the PG&E Projects to Con Edison Development will not be made during the pendency of the bankruptcy. Unless the default under the PG&E PPAs is timely cured or the lenders for the related project debt otherwise agree, the lenders may, upon written notice, declare principal and interest on the project debt to be due and payable immediately and, if such amounts are not timely paid, foreclose on the related projects.
