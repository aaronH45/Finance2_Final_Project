On February 26, 2019, Arizona Public Service Company (“APS” or the “Company”) entered into a $200 million unsecured term loan with SunTrust Bank, as Agent, SunTrust Bank, TD Bank, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as Co-Syndication Agents, and such institutions comprising the lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan”). The obligations under the Term Loan will mature and become due and payable on August 26, 2020. APS will use the proceeds of the Term Loan to refinance indebtedness of the Company and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Term Loan will bear interest at 50 basis points above the London interbank offered rate. 

The Term Loan includes customary covenants, including requirements that APS maintain a consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio not to exceed a prescribed maximum level and comply with certain lien restrictions. The Term Loan also includes customary events of default, including a cross default provision and a change of control provision. If an event of default occurs, lenders holding a specified percentage of the outstanding loans, or the agent with such lenders’ consent, may declare the obligations outstanding under the Term Loan to be due and payable. APS and its affiliates maintain normal banking and other relationships with the agent/lenders in the Term Loan.
