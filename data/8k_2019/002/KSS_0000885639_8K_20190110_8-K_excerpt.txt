Item 7.01.   Regulation FD Disclosure. 

On January 10, 2019, Kohl's Corporation issued a press release providing November/December combined comparable sales results and updated fiscal 2018 earnings guidance. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein. 

As noted in the press release, the Company will be taking actions in the fourth quarter as part of its Operational Excellence initiatives. These actions consist of the following: 

•The Company has decided to close four lower performing Kohl’s stores in 2019. For a variety of reasons, including real estate and other operational costs, the Company will be closing its Rego Park, NY, Valley Stream, NY, Lenexa, KS and Houma, LA locations. Also in 2019, the Company plans to open four smaller format stores, keeping the Company’s overall store count at 1,158. The Company plans to share details on the locations and timing of these openings in the near future. 

•The Company has decided to consolidate its Customer Service and Operations Center (CSOC) locations from three locations to two, closing the Dallas, TX location in early March and expanding the San Antonio, TX and Milwaukee, WI CSOC locations. 

•The Company will be offering a voluntary retirement program to hourly associates age 55+ with at least 15 full years of service with the Company. 

•The Company will also impair certain intangible assets prior to closing its fiscal 2018. 

While these actions will result in non-recurring charges, at this time the Company is not able to quantify the charges that it will take in the fourth quarter and in future periods resulting from these actions. The Company expects the amount of these charges will be finalized prior to the release of its earnings in March. 

The information in this Item 7.01, including the exhibit attached hereto, is furnished solely pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K. Consequently, such information is not deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Further, the information in this Item 7.01, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933.
