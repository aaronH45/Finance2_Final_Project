Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For the fourth quarter and full year 2018, compared to the same periods in 2017: 

•Cost of goods sold and non-GAAP cost of goods sold increased primarily due to reserves for excess raw material inventory. In the fourth quarter of 2018, inventory reserves of $410 million, or approximately $0.31 per diluted share, were recorded for excess raw materials primarily due to a sustained decrease in demand for Harvoni. The full year cost of goods sold also increased due to amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with Gilead’s acquisition of Kite.

•Product gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin decreased primarily due to the factors noted above.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017:

include: Gilead’s ability to achieve its anticipated full year 2019 financial results; Gilead’s ability to sustain growth in revenues for its antiviral and other programs; the risk that private and public payers may be reluctant to provide, or continue to provide, coverage or reimbursement for new products, including Yescarta and Biktarvy; austerity measures in European countries that may increase the amount of discount required on Gilead’s products; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments and geographic regions and decreases in treatment duration; availability of funding for state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs); continued fluctuations in ADAP purchase driven by federal and state grant cycles as well as purchase by retail pharmacies and other non-wholesaler locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements may not mirror patient demand and may cause fluctuations in Gilead’s earnings; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of Viread and Truvada; an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; potential amendments to the Affordable Care Act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices or reducing the number of insured patients; Gilead’s ability to initiate clinical trials in its currently anticipated timeframes; the levels of inventory held by wholesalers and retailers which may cause fluctuations in Gilead’s earnings; Gilead’s ability to develop products under the collaborations with Agenus Inc., Scholar Rock Holding Corporation and Tango Therapeutics, Inc.; Gilead’s ability to submit new drug applications for new product candidates in the timelines currently anticipated; Gilead’s ability to receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all, for new and current products; Gilead’s ability to successfully commercialize its products, including Yescarta; the risk that physicians and patients may not see advantages of these products over other therapies and may therefore be reluctant to prescribe the products; safety and efficacy data from clinical studies may not warrant further development of Gilead’s product candidates, including GS-9674, KTE-X19 and product candidates evaluated for advanced fibrosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and under Gilead’s HBV cure program; Gilead’s ability to pay dividends or complete its share repurchase program due to changes in its stock price, corporate or other market conditions; fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the U.S. dollar that may cause an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact on Gilead’s future revenues and pre-tax earnings; and other risks identified from time to time in Gilead’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). In addition, Gilead makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Gilead bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There may be other factors of which Gilead is not currently aware that may affect matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and may also cause actual results to differ significantly from these estimates.
