Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On February 11, 2019, we announced and priced an offering of fixed rate notes due 2026 (the “Notes” and the “Notes Offering”).  

In connection with the Notes Offering, on February 11, 2019, we entered into a Terms Agreement in respect of the Notes (the “Terms Agreement”) with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell the Notes to the Underwriters. The provisions of an Amended and Restated Underwriting Agreement dated as of February 28, 2011 (the “Underwriting Agreement”) are incorporated by reference into the Terms Agreement. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 and a copy of the Terms Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.2 to this Current Report.  

On February 13, 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million of the Notes. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 6, 2015 (the “Indenture”), by and between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented and modified by the Supplemental Indenture No. 1, dated as of February 13, 2019, by and between us and the Trustee (to change the notice period for redemptions of the Notes and future note offerings), and as further supplemented and modified in respect of the Notes by an officers’ certificate under Section 301 of the Indenture, dated as of February 13, 2019 (the “301 Certificate”). We filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) the Indenture together with our Registration Statement (as defined below) on March 2, 2017.  

We have filed with the SEC a Prospectus, dated as of March 2, 2017, and a Prospectus Supplement for the Notes, dated as of February 11, 2019, each of which forms a part of our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-216408) (the “Registration Statement”) in connection with the offering of the Notes.
