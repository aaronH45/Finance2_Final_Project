[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Company expects 2019 revenues to range between $2.76 billion and $2.96 billion and 2019 adjusted EBITDA between $1.24 billion and $1.34 billion

DUBLIN, February 28, 2019 -- Endo International plc (NASDAQ: ENDP) today reported fourth-quarter 2018 financial results, including:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

"We are pleased to report both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth during the fourth quarter. This resulted from continued dedicated operational execution and strategic focus, and concluded a full year of strong performance. The fourth quarter's performance was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. Branded - Sterile Injectables segment and in the Specialty Products portfolio of our U.S. Branded - Specialty & Established Pharmaceuticals segment," said Paul Campanelli, President and Chief Executive Officer of Endo. "We expect to further enhance our capabilities in these core growth areas as well as in the development of high-barrier generic products and we expect 2019 to be a critical transitional year as we progress to the next phase of our multi-year turnaround plan."

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

(in thousands, except per share amounts)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

__________

(1)Diluted per share data is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding and, if there is income from continuing operations during the period, the dilutive impact of share equivalents outstanding during the period. In the case of Adjusted Diluted Weighted Average Shares, Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations is used in determining whether to include such dilutive impact.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Total revenues were $786 million in fourth-quarter 2018 compared to $769 million during the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to continued strong growth in the U.S. Branded - Sterile Injectables segment and the Specialty Products portfolio of our U.S. Branded - Specialty & Established Pharmaceuticals segment. In addition to the continued strong underlying performance of our core areas of growth, the fourth quarter increase in these areas reflects a benefit from the timing of shipments compared to prior year. These factors were partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment and the divestiture of the Company's Mexican business, Somar. 

GAAP net loss from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2018 was $265 million compared to GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $272 million during the same period in 2017. This result was primarily attributable to an overall reduction in operating expenses, including the impact of lower litigation-related charges and research and development expenses, partially offset by higher asset impairment charges. GAAP diluted net loss per share from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2018 was $1.18 compared to GAAP diluted net loss per share from continuing operations of $1.22 in fourth-quarter 2017.

Adjusted income from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2018 was $175 million compared to $174 million in fourth-quarter 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2018 was $0.75 compared to $0.77 in fourth-quarter 2017.

U.S. BRANDED - SPECIALTY & ESTABLISHED PHARMACEUTICALS

The Company reported positive results from two Phase 3 clinical trials of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (or "CCH") for the treatment of cellulite in the buttocks. Trial subjects receiving CCH showed highly statistically significant levels of improvement in the appearance of cellulite with treatment, as measured by the trial's primary endpoint.

Fourth-quarter 2018 U.S. Branded - Specialty & Established Pharmaceuticals results include:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

U.S. BRANDED - STERILE INJECTABLES

Fourth-quarter 2018 U.S. Branded - Sterile Injectables revenues were $259 million, an increase of 32 percent compared to fourth-quarter 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to the continued strong growth of ADRENALIN® and VASOSTRICT® and a benefit from timing of shipments compared to prior year.

U.S. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS

During fourth-quarter 2018, the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment launched three products. Fourth-quarter 2018 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals revenues were $264 million compared to $303 million in fourth-quarter 2017. This performance was primarily attributable to competitive pressures in the generics business.

INTERNATIONAL PHARMACEUTICALS

Fourth-quarter 2018 International Pharmaceuticals revenues were $34 million, compared to $41 million in the same period in 2017. This performance is primarily attributable to the Somar divestiture in the fourth-quarter of 2017.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company utilizes certain financial measures that are not prescribed by or prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These Non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP net income and its components and diluted earnings per share amounts. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that these are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations and its components (unlike GAAP net income from continuing operations and its components) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These Non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.

Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. However, the Company does not provide reconciliations of projected non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, nor does it provide comparable projected GAAP financial measures for such projected non-GAAP financial measures. The Company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments that could be made for asset impairments, contingent consideration adjustments, legal settlements, loss on extinguishment of debt, adjustments to inventory and other charges reflected in the reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which could be significant.

See Endo's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished today to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an explanation of Endo's non-GAAP financial measures.

Because forecasts are inherently estimates that cannot be made with precision, Endo’s performance at times differs materially from its estimates and targets, and Endo often does not know what the actual results will be until after the end of the applicable reporting period. Therefore, Endo will not report or comment on its progress during a current quarter except through public announcement. Any statement made by others with respect to progress during a current quarter cannot be attributed to Endo.

political instability, financial hardship, consumer confidence and debt levels, taxation, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, international relations, capital and credit availability, the status of financial markets and institutions, fluctuations or devaluations in the value of sovereign government debt, as well as the general impact of continued economic volatility, can materially affect Endo’s results.
