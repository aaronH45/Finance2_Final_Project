 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  

 Western Union Reports Fourth Quarter   

 And Full Year Results  

 Strong digital growth  

 Full year operating margin 20.1%  

 Over $740 million returned to shareholders in 2018  

 Quarterly dividend increased 5%  

 DENVER, February 7, 2019: The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU), a global leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement, today reported financial results for the 2018 fourth quarter and full year and provided its financial outlook for 2019.  

 GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.48 compared to a loss of ($2.44) in the prior year period, as the prior year period was negatively impacted by significant adjustment items (refer to Adjustment Items section for details). On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $0.49 compared to $0.41 in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to an increased operating profit margin, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower revenues.  

 The Company generated revenue of $1.4 billion in the quarter, which declined 3% compared to the prior year, or increased 2% on a constant currency basis. The strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso negatively impacted reported revenue by 4 percentage points in the quarter, while the effects of inflation on the Company’s Argentina-based businesses are estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenue by approximately 2 percentage points.  

 Consumer money transfer revenues declined 1% in the quarter due to the impact of foreign exchange, but increased 1% in constant currency, led by strong growth in westernunion.com. The Company’s operating profit margin was 19.3% in the quarter.   

 “Strong digital growth continues to drive our results,” said president and CEO Hikmet Ersek. “Westernunion.com money transfer transaction growth accelerated to 25% in the quarter, while overall margins were solid. Our customers have consistently demonstrated their resilience, even in periods of slowing global economic growth.”  

 Ersek added, “In 2018 we made important strategic progress. We feel confident about our operations and business. In 2019 we will continue to execute our strategy to deliver strong digital expansion, offer our cross-border platform to new payments areas, and generate additional operating efficiencies.”  

 The new quarterly dividend of $0.20 per common share, which represents a 5% increase over the previous dividend of $0.19, is payable March 29, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2019.  

 Executive vice president and CFO Raj Agrawal stated, “Efficient cost management and our WU Way programs helped us deliver stable profit margins and solid cash flow in 2018. We returned over $740 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases last year and are pleased to announce today a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend.”  

 Q4 Business Unit Highlights  

   ·    Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) revenues, which represented 80% of total Company revenue in the quarter, declined 1% on a reported basis, or increased 1% constant currency, while transactions grew 4%. Geographically, constant currency revenue growth was led by sends originated in Latin America and Europe, partially offset by declines in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. 

 Westernunion.com C2C revenues increased 21%, or 22% constant currency, and transactions increased 25%. Westernunion.com is now available in more than 60 countries, plus additional territories, including approximately 20 new launches over the past year. Westernunion.com revenues represented 12% of total C2C revenue in the quarter.   

   ·    Western Union Business Solutions revenues increased 3%, or 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in both payments and foreign exchange services. Business Solutions represented 7% of total Company revenues in the quarter. 

   ·    Other revenues, which primarily consist of bill payments businesses in the U.S. and Argentina, declined 11%, or increased 10% on a constant currency basis. The strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso negatively impacted Other reported revenue by 21 percentage points in the quarter, while the effects of inflation on the Argentina Pago Facil bill payments business are estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenue by approximately 11 percentage points. Other revenues represented 13% of total Company revenues in the quarter. 

 Additional Q4 Financial Highlights  

   ·    GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 19.3%, which compares to (17.5%) in the prior year period, or 18.0% in the prior year on an adjusted basis. GAAP operating profit of $271 million compares to a loss of ($252) million in the prior year, or $258 million in the prior year on an adjusted basis. The improvement in GAAP operating profit was primarily due to adjustment items in the prior year period. The improvement in adjusted operating profit margin was driven by lower bad debt, marketing, and incentive compensation expenses compared to the prior year period, which were partially offset by higher corporate expenses and technology spending.  

   ·    The effective tax rate in the quarter was 9.8%, with tax expense in the current year quarter of $23 million comparing to $832 million in the prior year period. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act in the U.S. On an adjusted basis, the tax rate was 6.3% compared to 14.3% in the prior year period. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to certain discrete items in the current year period.  

   ·    The Company returned $133 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, consisting of $49 million in share repurchases and $84 million of dividends. 

 2018 Full Year Results  

   ·    The Company’s full year revenue increased 1%, or 3% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. The strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso reduced reported revenue growth by approximately 2.5 percentage points, while the impact of inflation on the Company’s Argentina-based businesses is estimated to have increased revenue growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points. 

   ·    GAAP operating margin of 20.1% compares to 8.6% in the prior year, or 20.0% on an adjusted basis in 2017. The improvement in GAAP operating margin was primarily due to adjustment items in the prior year period. 

   ·    The effective tax rate for the year was 14.1%. The full year tax expense was $139 million, which compares to $905 million in the prior year, with the decrease primarily due to the impact of adjustment items in the prior year, including expenses associated with the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act and other adjustment items, the adjusted tax rate of 11.8% for the full year compares to 13.1% in 2017. The adjusted tax rate in both periods benefited from various discrete items.  

   ·    GAAP earnings / (loss) per share of $1.87 increased from ($1.19) in the prior year, primarily due to adjustment items in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.92 compares to $1.80 in 2017. The increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to higher revenues, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer shares outstanding. 

   ·    GAAP cash flow from operating activities for the year was $821 million, including the impact of approximately $120 million of tax payments related to the agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service announced in 2011, a $60 million payment for the previously announced NYDFS settlement, and approximately $30 million of outflows for prior year WU Way expenses. The Company returned $741 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the full year. 

 Adjustment Items  

 Adjusted metrics for 2018 exclude the impact of tax expense related to changes in estimates for the provisional accounting for the Tax Act ($8 million for Q4 and $23 million for the full year).  

 Adjusted metrics for 2017 exclude the impact of the Tax Act ($828 million for Q4 and full year), a non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Business Solutions reporting unit ($464 million for Q4 and full year), expenses related to the WU Way business transformation ($35 million for Q4 and $94 million for full year), an accrual related to a settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS Settlement,” $11 million for Q4 and $60 million for full year), additional expenses for an independent compliance auditor as required by the Joint Settlement Agreements ($8 million for full year), and related tax impacts.  

 2019 Outlook   

 The Company’s strategies remain focused on digital expansion, customer experience improvements, operating efficiencies, and new cross-border payments opportunities. In 2019, the Company expects stable financial performance in a slowing global economic growth environment, with a negative impact from foreign exchange and a higher effective tax rate compared to the prior year, primarily due to impacts from the U.S. Tax Act’s Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT).  

 The Company has identified and is in the process of implementing structural actions to mitigate the adverse impact of BEAT. The 2019 outlook reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 17-18%, which anticipates the mitigation efforts are implemented in stages during the year. The Company currently expects the effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens level in 2020, reflecting the full effect of mitigation.   

 The Company expects the following outlook for 2019:  

 Revenue  

   ·    GAAP: low single-digit decrease to a low single-digit increase 

   ·    Constant currency: low single-digit increase (excluding any benefit related to Argentina inflation) 

 Operating Profit Margin  

   ·    Operating margin of approximately 20% 

 Tax Rate  

   ·    Effective tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% in 2019  

 Earnings per Share   

   ·    EPS in a range of $1.83 to $1.95  

 Cash Flow  

   ·    Cash flow from operating activities of approximately $1 billion 

 Additional Statistics  

 Additional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental tables included with this press release.   

 Expenses related to the goodwill impairment, NYDFS Settlement, Joint Settlement Agreements and the WU Way business transformation are not included in operating segment results, as they are excluded from the measurement of segment operating income provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. Expenses associated with the WU Way business transformation initiative were effectively complete as of December 31, 2017.  

 All amounts included in the supplemental tables to this press release are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, the percentage changes and margins disclosed herein may not recalculate precisely using the rounded amounts provided.  

 Non-GAAP Measures  

 Western Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year.  

 These non-GAAP financial measures include consolidated revenue change constant currency adjusted; Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue change constant currency adjusted; Consumer-to-Consumer segment westernunion.com revenue change constant currency adjusted; Business Solutions segment revenue change constant currency adjusted; Other revenue change constant currency adjusted; consolidated operating income, excluding the impact from goodwill impairment, NYDFS Settlement, Joint Settlement Agreements and WU Way business transformation expenses; consolidated operating margin, excluding goodwill impairment, NYDFS Settlement, Joint Settlement Agreements and WU Way business transformation expenses; effective tax rate excluding goodwill impairment, NYDFS Settlement, Joint Settlement Agreements, WU Way business transformation expenses and Tax Act; earnings per share, excluding goodwill impairment, NYDFS Settlement, Joint Settlement Agreements, WU Way business transformation expenses and Tax Act; and additional measures found in the supplemental tables included with this press release. Although the expenses related to the WU Way business transformation are specific to that initiative, the types of expenses related to the WU Way business transformation are similar to expenses that the Company has previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future.

 NOTES TO KEY STATISTICS  

 (in millions, unless indicated otherwise)  

 (Unaudited)  

 Western Union’s management believes the non-GAAP financial measures presented provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results to assist management, investors, analysts, and others in understanding our financial results and to better analyze trends in our underlying business, because they provide consistency and comparability to prior periods.  

 A non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below. All adjusted year-over-year changes were calculated using prior year amounts. Although the expenses related to the WU Way are specific to that initiative, the types of expenses related to the WU Way initiative are similar to expenses that the Company has previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future.

 Non-GAAP related notes:  

   (s)    Represents the impact from the fluctuation in exchange rates between all foreign currency denominated amounts and the United States dollar. Constant currency results exclude any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with information about operating results and trends that eliminates currency volatility and provides greater clarity regarding, and increases the comparability of, our underlying results and trends. 

   (t)    Represents a non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our Business Solutions reporting unit. The impairment primarily resulted from a decrease in projected revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins. These projections were reevaluated due to the declines in revenues and operating results recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017, which were significantly below management’s expectations. Additionally, as disclosed in prior Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, the total estimated fair value of the Business Solutions reporting unit previously included value derived from strategies to optimize United States cash flow management and global liquidity by utilizing international cash balances (including balances generated by other operating segments) to initially fund global principal payouts for Business Solutions transactions initiated in the United States that would have been available to certain market participants. However, the December 2017 enactment of tax reform into United States law (“Tax Act”) eliminated any fair value associated with these cash management strategies. This charge has been excluded from segment operating income, as this charge has been excluded from the measurement of segment operating income provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. We believe that, by excluding the effects of significant charges associated with non-cash impairment charges that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of our underlying operating results. 

   (u)    Represents the impact from an accrual for a consent order with the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) related to matters identified as part of the Joint Settlement Agreements (referred to above as the “NYDFS Consent Order” or the “NYDFS Settlement”), as described in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 4, 2018. Amounts related to the NYDFS Consent Order were recognized in the second and fourth quarters of 2017, and the expenses had no related income tax benefit. These expenses have been excluded from segment operating income, as these expenses are excluded from the measurement of segment operating income provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. We believe that, by excluding the effects of significant charges associated with the settlement of litigation that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of our underlying operating results. 

   (v)    Represents the impact from the settlement agreements related to (1) a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the United States Department of Justice, and the United States Attorney’s Offices for the Eastern and Middle Districts of Pennsylvania, the Central District of California, and the Southern District of Florida, (2) a Stipulated Order for Permanent Injunction and Final Judgment with the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and (3) a Consent to the Assessment of Civil Money Penalty with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the United States Department of Treasury (referred to above, collectively, as the “Joint Settlement Agreements”), to resolve the respective investigations of those agencies, as described in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 20, 2017, and related matters. Amounts related to these matters were recognized in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2016 and the full year 2016 results. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2017, we recorded an additional accrual in the amount of $8 million related to an independent compliance auditor, pursuant to the terms of the Joint Settlement Agreements. These expenses have been excluded from our segment operating income, as these expenses are excluded from the measurement of segment operating income provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. We believe that, by excluding the effects of significant charges associated with the settlement of litigation that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of our underlying operating results.

 (Unaudited)  

   (w)    Represents the expenses incurred to transform our operating model, focusing on technology transformation, network productivity, customer and agent process optimization, and organizational redesign to better drive efficiencies and growth initiatives (“WU Way business transformation expenses”). Amounts related to the WU Way business transformation expenses were recognized beginning in the second quarter of 2016, and each subsequent quarter in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, expenses associated with the WU Way initiative were effectively complete. These expenses have been excluded from our segment operating income, as these expenses are excluded from the measurement of segment operating income provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. We believe that, by excluding the effects of significant charges associated with the transformation of our operating model that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of our other underlying operating results. Although the expenses related to the WU Way are specific to that initiative, the types of expenses related to the WU Way initiative are similar to expenses that the Company has previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future. 

   (x)    Represents the impact to our provision for income taxes related to the Tax Act, primarily due to a tax on previously undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax balances to reflect the lower federal income tax rate, among other effects. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our accounting for the Tax Act. 

   (y)    Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) results from taking operating income and adjusting for depreciation and amortization expenses. EBITDA results provide an additional performance measurement calculation which helps neutralize the operating income effect of assets acquired in prior periods. 

   (z)    For the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, non-GAAP diluted weighted-average shares outstanding includes 3.3 million and 3.0 million shares, respectively. These shares are excluded from the Company’s GAAP diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as they are anti-dilutive due to the Company’s GAAP net losses for the respective periods.
