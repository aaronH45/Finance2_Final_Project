 Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement  

 On February 1, 2019, in connection with the closing of the previously-announced offering by Transocean Poseidon Limited (the “Issuer”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Transocean Ltd., of U.S. $550 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior secured notes due 2027 (the “Notes”), the Issuer entered into an indenture (the “Indenture”) with Transocean Ltd., Transocean Inc. (“TINC”) and Triton Poseidon GmbH (collectively, the “Guarantors”) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent.   

 The Notes are secured by a lien on the Deepwater Poseidon and certain other assets related to the rig. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors on a senior basis (the “Guarantees”). The Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or under any state securities laws, and were offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.   

 The terms of the Notes are governed by the Indenture, which contains covenants that, among other things, (i) limit the activities of the Issuer, the owner of the collateral rig and the operator of the collateral rig, (ii) limit the ability of TINC and its subsidiaries to incur liens and engage in certain sale and lease-back transactions, (iii) limit the ability of TINC’s subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and (iv) limit the ability of the Issuer and the Guarantors to consolidate, merge or enter into a scheme of arrangement qualifying as an amalgamation. The Indenture also contains customary events of default. Indebtedness under the Notes may be accelerated in certain circumstances upon an event of default as set forth in the Indenture.   

 The description above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Indenture filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
