The foregoing list of factors is not all-inclusive because it is not possible to predict all factors. Furthermore, it may not be possible to assess the impact of any such factor on CenterPoint Energy’s or Vectren’s respective businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Additional risks and uncertainties will be discussed in other materials that CenterPoint Energy and Vectren will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with the proposed transactions. Other risk factors are detailed from time to time in CenterPoint Energy’s and Vectren’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, but any specific factors that may be provided should not be construed as exhaustive. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement. While CenterPoint Energy believes these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, CenterPoint Energy undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
