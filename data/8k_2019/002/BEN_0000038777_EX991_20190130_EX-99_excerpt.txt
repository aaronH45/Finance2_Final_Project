FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Franklin Resources, Inc. Announces First Quarter Results

San Mateo, CA, January 30, 2019 – Franklin Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) [NYSE: BEN] today announced net income1 of $275.9 million or $0.54 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $502.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share for the previous quarter, which included an $89.6 million or $0.17 per diluted share reduction of the estimated income tax charge2 resulting from enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The mark-to-market of the Company’s investment portfolio led to nonoperating losses that contributed to the decline in net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The Company had a net loss1 of $583.3 million or $1.06 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which included an estimated income tax charge2 of $1.1 billion or $1.94 per diluted share resulting from the Tax Act. Operating income was $411.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $478.7 million for the previous quarter and $581.1 million in the prior year.

“Volatility dominated global markets in the first fiscal quarter,” said Greg Johnson, Chairman and CEO of Franklin Resources, Inc. “However, we believe periods of volatility are when active, professional investment management matters most. Despite the numerous ups and downs of the market, we’re seeing examples of strengthening investment performance.

“Over the past several years, we have made significant investments to drive company growth in the areas of investment management, distribution, multi-asset solutions, technology and new products. Additionally, the acquisition of Benefit Street Partners provides us with new investment capabilities in private credit that complement our existing alternatives and fixed income platforms, and positions us well in a growing market. While we will continue to invest strategically in areas that are vital to our ongoing success and future growth, additional work is now being done to offset those expenses.”

The Company also announced that the acquisition of Benefit Street Partners L.L.C. (“BSP”), a leading alternative credit manager, is expected to close on February 1, 2019. Following the close, Tom Gahan will be appointed Head of Alternatives for Franklin Templeton, in addition to maintaining his role as CEO and CIO of BSP.

(“Franklin”) and its subsidiaries, which are not historical facts, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this press release, words or phrases generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “estimate” or other similar words are forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. While forward-looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them and are cautioned against doing so. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. 

These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin’s recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklin’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and Franklin’s subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q:

•Volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, and adverse changes in the global economy, may significantly affect our results of operations and may put pressure on our financial results.

•The amount and mix of our AUM are subject to significant fluctuations.

•We are subject to extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations. 

•Global regulatory and legislative actions and reforms have made the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 

•Failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in substantial harm to our reputation and results of operations.

•Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

•Any significant limitation, failure or security breach of our information and cyber security infrastructure, software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could disrupt our business and harm our operations and reputation.

•Our business operations are complex and a failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our services and products, or the termination of investment management agreements representing a significant portion of our AUM, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and income.

•We face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries. 

•We depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services. 

•Strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and income. 

•Changes in the third-party distribution and sales channels on which we depend could reduce our income and hinder our growth. 

•Our increasing focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of our products subjects us to increased exchange rate and market-specific political, economic or other risks that may adversely impact our revenues and income generated overseas. 

•Harm to our reputation or poor investment performance of our products could reduce the level of our AUM or affect our sales, and negatively impact our revenues and income. 

•Our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses, which is subject to fluctuation. 

•Our ability to successfully manage and grow our business can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations. 

•Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability. 

•Regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations, litigation and the legal risks associated with our business, could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results. 

•Our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including the market value of our assets, operating cash flows and our perceived creditworthiness. 

•We are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries.

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.
