FLUOR REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2018 RESULTS

IRVING, TX (February 21, 2019) - Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) today announced financial results for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Earnings attributable to Fluor were $225 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, compared to 2017 earnings of $191 million, or $1.36 per diluted share. Earnings attributable to Fluor in 2018 were negatively impacted by $79 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Excluding this non-cash item, adjusted earnings attributable to Fluor for 2018 were $304 million, or $2.15 per diluted share. Consolidated segment profit for the year was $602 million, up from $545 million a year ago. Revenue of $19.2 billion in 2018 compares to $19.5 billion in the prior year. Full year new awards more than doubled to $27.7 billion, consisting of $10.6 billion in Energy & Chemicals, $10.8 billion in Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, $4.1 billion in Government and $2.1 billion in Diversified Services. Consolidated backlog at year-end was $40 billion. 

"In 2018 Fluor continued to transform our approach to address the rapidly changing global markets and set the foundation for long-term sustainable growth," said David Seaton, Fluor chairman and chief executive officer. "Despite the challenges we encountered last year, we enter 2019 with a sizeable backlog and a compelling integrated solution for the end markets we serve."

Corporate G&A expense for 2018 was $148 million, down from $192 million a year ago. Expenses for the year decreased primarily due to favorable foreign exchange fluctuations. Fluor’s cash and marketable securities at the end of the year was $2.0 billion. During 2018, the company paid out $119 million in dividends and repurchased $50 million of Fluor shares. 

Fourth Quarter Results

Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $50 million, or $0.36 per diluted share. Excluding $58 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in non-cash tax charges related to the valuation allowance previously mentioned, adjusted earnings attributable to Fluor for the fourth quarter were $108 million, or $0.77 per diluted share. Results for the fourth quarter of 2018 include a pre-tax charge of $72 million for a gas-fired power project and a downstream project, both now online, and an offshore project. Segment profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $149 million, down from $195 million a year ago. Corporate G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 declined to $8 million, compared with $54 million a year ago due to favorable foreign exchange fluctuations and lower stock-based compensation expense. Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion and new awards were $10.1 billion. 

Outlook 

For 2019, the Company is establishing its initial EPS guidance at a range of $2.50 to $3.00 per diluted share, excluding any impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Guidance for 2019 assumes increasing contributions and a balanced set of opportunities from our Energy & Chemicals and Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure and Power segments.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains discussions of consolidated segment profit, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share that would be deemed non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules. Segment profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding: corporate general and administrative expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non-operating income and expense items. The company believes that consolidated segment profit provides a meaningful perspective on its business results as it is the aggregation of individual segment profit measures that the company utilizes to evaluate and manage its business performance. A reconciliation of this measure to earnings (loss) before taxes is included in the press release tables. The company also excludes certain tax events from earnings and earnings per diluted share in this press release because the frequency and magnitude of similar events may vary widely across periods.This press release also includes forward-looking references to earnings per diluted share with certain exclusions that would be deemed a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC rules. Because the company is unable to reliably estimate the amounts of the excluded items, this press release does not contain a reconciliation to earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable forward-looking measure.
