Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

 Item 2.03  

Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant  

On January 16, 2019, Prologis, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), and various affiliates of the Operating Partnership entered into a Second Amended and Restated Global Senior Credit Agreement (the “Global Facility”) with various lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as Global Administrative Agent. Pursuant to the Global Facility, the Operating Partnership and various affiliates thereof (collectively the “Borrowers”) may obtain loans and/or procure the issuance of letters of credit in various currencies on a revolving basis in an aggregate amount not exceeding the U.S. Dollar equivalent of approximately $3,500,000,000 (subject to increase to not more than the U.S. Dollar equivalent of $4,500,000,000 (determined as of the effective date of such increase) pursuant to the accordion feature included in the Global Facility). As of the closing date, the Global Facility has three tranches: (i) a U.S. Dollar Tranche in the amount of $2,300,000,000, (ii) a Euro Tranche in the amount of €850,000,000, and (iii) a Yen Tranche in the amount of ¥25,000,000,000.  

The Global Facility is scheduled to mature on January 16, 2023, but the Operating Partnership may, at its option and subject to payment of an extension fee, extend the maturity date of the Global Facility for six months on two occasions (to July 14, 2023 and January 16, 2024, respectively). Pricing under the Global Facility, including the spread over the applicable LIBOR and the rates applicable to facility fees and letter of credit fees, varies based upon the public debt ratings of the Operating Partnership as in effect from time to time. As of the closing date, the spread was 77.5 basis points. The Global Facility contains customary representations, covenants (including certain financial tests applicable to the Operating Partnership) and defaults (including a cross-acceleration to other recourse indebtedness of more than $150,000,000). The Operating Partnership has unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of each other borrower under the Global Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the Global Facility, Prologis, Inc. is not required to guarantee the obligations of the borrowers under the Global Facility unless Prologis, Inc. incurs any indebtedness that is not in existence as of the date of the Global Facility or guarantees any indebtedness that is not guaranteed by Prologis, Inc. as of the date of the Global Facility.  

The Global Facility has been included herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
