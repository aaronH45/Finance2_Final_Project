U.S. comparable sales results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs and it is important to review in conjunction with the Company's financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Comparable sales excluding fuel is also an important, separate metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs without considering fuel, which is volatile and unpredictable. Other companies in our industry may calculate comparable sales differently, limiting the comparability of the metric.

Reconciliations of and Other Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(Unaudited)

The following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP financial information presented in the press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies.

Constant Currency 

In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.

Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart's underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. 

The table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues, net sales and operating income for the three and twelve months ended January 31, 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Change versus prior year comparable period.

Free Cash Flow

We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $27.8 billion for the twelve months ended January 31, 2019, which declined when compared to $28.3 billion for the twelve months ended January 31, 2018 primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments. We generated free cash flow of $17.4 billion for the twelve months ended January 31, 2019, which declined when compared to $18.3 billion for the twelve months ended January 31, 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures. 

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. 

Additionally, Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  

Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart's management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 "Net cash used in investing activities" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.

Adjusted EPS

Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC's rules because it excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart's core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance. 

We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three months and fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 by adjusting EPS for the following: (1) adjustments in the provisional amount related to Tax Reform, (2) unrealized gains and losses on the company's equity investment in JD.com and (3) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 only, the loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil. We adjust for the following two items on a recurring basis each quarter: 

•Tax Reform - The SEC allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a one year measurement period from the U.S. Tax Reform enactment date. While the company recorded provisional amounts in fiscal 2018, the company adjusted such provisional amounts during fiscal 2019. As the company adjusted EPS in fiscal 2018, for consistency, the company also adjusted EPS in fiscal 2019 for changes to the provisional amounts. This is the last quarter the company will adjust for Tax Reform.  

•Unrealized gains and losses - Beginning in fiscal 2019, due to a change in U.S. accounting principles, Walmart is required to include unrealized gains/losses of certain equity investments within net income. The company's unrealized gains/losses primarily relate to Walmart's equity investment in JD.com. While the company's investment in JD.com was a strategic decision for the company's retail operations in China, management's measurement of that strategy is primarily focused on the Walmart China financial results rather than the investment value of JD.com. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in fair value of its equity investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS for the unrealized JD.com investment gains/losses.

2 Quarterly net impact of individual adjustments or Adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD net impact of individual adjustments or YTD Adjusted EPS due to rounding. Additionally, the sum of all individual adjustments may not sum due to rounding.

As previously disclosed in our fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 press release, we have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three months and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 by adjusting EPS for the following: (1) restructuring charges, (2) losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt, (3) asset impairments and write-offs, (4) U.S. associate lump sum bonuses, (5) the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, (6) a legal settlement recovery and, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 only, the (7) the FCPA accrual based on discussions with government agencies regarding the possible resolution of the FCPA matter and (8) the gain on sale of Suburbia. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is EPS. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Calculated based on nature of item and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions. 

2 Restructuring charges include $0.20 for restructurings in the U.S., primarily relating to Sam's Club store closures and Home Office severance, and $0.08 for Walmart International, primarily due to the winding down of the first party Brazil eCommerce operations.  

3 Asset impairments and write-offs for Q4 includes $0.08 of impairment charges due to decisions to discontinue certain real estate projects at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club and technology assets at Corporate, and $0.04 for the write-off of certain assets at Walmart International. Additionally, Q3 includes $0.04 related to a decision to exit certain properties in a Walmart International market. 

4 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of the noncontrolling interest at Walmex.
