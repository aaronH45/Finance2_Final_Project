        "DEFINITIONS OF OTHER KEY TERMS Average Effective Rent per Unit Average Effective Rent per Unit represents the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occu pie d units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current mark et rate. MAA believes average effective rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. It does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. Average Physical Occupancy Average Physical Occupancy represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the quarter. Development Communities Communities remain identified as development until certificates of occupancy are obtained for all units under development. On ce all units are delivered and available for occupancy, the community moves into the Lease - up Communities portfolio. Lease - up Communities New acquisitions acquired during lease - up and newly developed communities remain in the Lease - up Communities portfolio until sta bilized. Communities are considered stabilized after achieving at least 90% occupancy for 90 days. Non - Same Store Portfolio Non - Same Store Portfolio includes recent acquisitions, communities that have been identified for disposition, and communities th at have undergone a significant casualty loss. Same Store Portfolio MAA reviews its Same Store Portfolio at the beginning of each calendar year, or as significant transactions warrant. Communit ies are generally added into the Same Store Portfolio if they were owned and stabilized at the beginning of the previous year. Communities are considered stabiliz ed after achieving at least 90% occupancy for 90 days. Communities that have been approved by MAA's Board of Directors for disposition are excluded from the Same Store Po rtfolio. Communities that have undergone a significant casualty loss are also excluded from the Same Store Portfolio . Total Market Capitalization Total Market Capitalization equals the number of shares of common stock plus units not held by MAA at period end multiplied b y t he closing stock price at period end, plus total debt outstanding. Unencumbered NOI Unencumbered NOI represents NOI generated by unencumbered assets (as defined in MAALP's bond covenants). 31"
