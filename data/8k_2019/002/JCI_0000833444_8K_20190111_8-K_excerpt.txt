 Item 2.03.  

Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.  

On January 11, 2019, Johnson Controls International plc (the “Company”) entered into a US$750,000,000 Credit Agreement among the Company, the lenders party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent (the “Credit Agreement”), under which the Company received an unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $750 million that matures on the earlier of (a) January 10, 2020 and (b) the date that is five business days after the consummation of the sale of the Company’s power solutions business. The term loan will bear interest at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) determined for the interest period plus a fixed spread or, at the Company’s election, the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The proceeds of the term loan will be used for general business purposes.  

The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to the Company and, with certain exceptions, its subsidiaries. Among other requirements, the Company must maintain consolidated shareholders’ equity of at least $3.5 billion.  

The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under the Credit Agreement occurs and is continuing, then the administrative agent may declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. In addition, if the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries becomes the subject of voluntary or involuntary proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement will automatically become immediately due and payable.  

The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. In the ordinary course of business, certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial banking, cash management, foreign exchange or other financial services to the Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries for which they have received, and may in the future receive, compensation.
