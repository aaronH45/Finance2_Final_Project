Financial Results  

 Southwestern Energy recorded net income attributable to common stock of $307 million or $0.54 per diluted share and $535 million or $0.93 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018, respectively. For full year 2018, net income reflects stronger operating performance driven by 78 percent higher liquids revenue of $548 million, which was partially offset by impairments associated with the Fayetteville sale, restructuring charges and unsettled derivative losses of $24 million in 2018 compared to an unsettled derivative gain of $451 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of unsettled derivatives, net income attributable to common stock was 54 percent higher for 2018 compared to the prior year. For the fourth quarter of 2018, net income was higher than 2017, due to higher natural gas and liquids revenue, offset by a settled derivative loss of $99 million in the fourth quarter and the impact of restructuring charges.   

 ﻿  

 For the full year 2018, adjusted net income was $590 million, more than $370 million above the prior year. For the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted net income attributable to common stock was $176 million, a 179 percent increase compared to the same quarter last year. Adjusted net income incorporates the impact of an assumed corporate tax rate of 24.5 percent, and excludes unsettled derivatives, as well as other one-time charges.   

 ﻿  

 For the fiscal year 2018, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”) was $1,484 million, 19 percent above 2017 due to improved realized prices, increased production and reduced general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher operating expenses related to a shift to more liquids-rich production in Southwest Appalachia. The primary components of adjusted EBITDA included $1,168 million from Appalachia operations and $377 million from Fayetteville operations, including Fayetteville Midstream. Adjusted EBITDA was $49 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to a year ago, and includes two months of Fayetteville ownership.  

 ﻿  

 For the full year 2018, weighted average realized price excluding derivatives was $2.66 per Mcfe, 15 percent or 34 cents higher than the prior year. Including derivatives, weighted average realized pricing was $2.57 per Mcfe, 12 percent above the prior year. For fiscal year 2018, Appalachia weighted average realized pricing was $2.82 per Mcfe, a $0.52 per Mcfe improvement compared to the prior year due to natural gas basis improvement, higher liquids production and improved liquids pricing.   

 ﻿  

 For the fourth quarter of 2018, weighted average realized pricing, excluding derivatives was $3.15 per Mcfe, which was 44 percent higher than the prior period, driven primarily by the impact of higher NGL and oil production and price realizations. Including the impact of derivative settlement losses of $99 million, weighted average realized pricing was $2.72 per Mcfe, 18 percent higher than the prior year. Appalachia weighted average realized pricing was $3.31 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter, 53 percent above the prior year.   

 ﻿  

 Total debt reduction for 2018 was $2.1 billion, including credit facility refinancing and the repurchase of senior notes. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company closed on the sale of its Fayetteville Shale assets and used the net proceeds received of $1.65  

 3  

billion to repurchase $900 million of senior notes, repurchase shares of common stock and repay all outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility, pending additional investments. Cash on hand at year-end was $201 million.   

 Pursuant to the Company’s $200 million authorized share repurchase program, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company invested $156 million to repurchase 34 million shares of common stock at an average price of $4.55 per share. In total, as of February 28, 2019, the Company has repurchased 44 million shares for a cumulative total of $199 million at an average price of $4.53 per share.  

 Southwestern Energy continues to execute a disciplined hedging program with physical, financial and basis derivatives on its forecasted natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production. A summary of the Company’s financial derivative position is provided in the attached financial tables. Additional information on physical and financial derivatives can be found in the Company’s 2018 Form 10-K.

 Operational Review  

 In 2018, the Company invested $1.23 billion in E&P operations which includes $1.11 billion in Appalachia and $60 million on the Southwest Appalachia water project. Southwestern Energy drilled 106 wells, completed 119 wells and placed 138 wells to sales.   

 ﻿  

 During the fourth quarter of 2018, Southwestern invested a total of approximately $175 million in its Appalachia operations and $21 million on the water project. The Company drilled 15 wells, completed 11 wells and placed 25 wells to sales.   

 ﻿  

 Southwest Appalachia – In 2018, Southwest Appalachia’s total net production increased 33 percent to 243 Bcfe and included 63,100 barrels per day of liquids. Liquids comprised 57 percent of production volumes. The Company brought 76 wells online, with approximately 80 percent of the wells located in the super rich acreage. The Company drilled and completed 71 Marcellus wells.  

 In the fourth quarter, the Company drilled nine wells, completed five and placed 17 to sales. These included two Upper Devonian wells with initial liquids production of 49 percent. Delineation of the Upper Devonian will continue in 2019.  

 On a full year basis, weighted average realized price on a natural gas equivalent basis was $3.34 per Mcfe, a $0.25 per Mcfe uplift compared to the NYMEX gas price of $3.09 per MMBtu. For the fourth quarter, weighted average realized price was $3.62 per Mcfe. The uplift is directly related to higher liquids production and premium pricing received from the sale of natural gas liquids and oil.   

 Northeast Appalachia – Northeast Appalachia’s 2018 total net production increased to 459 Bcf, up 16 percent. The increase in production was mainly due to Tioga well outperformance, gathering capacity expansion and cycle time improvements. The Company drilled 41 wells, completed 54 wells and placed 60 wells to sales.  

 ﻿  

 4  

Well activity in the fourth quarter of 2018 included six drilled wells, six completions and eight wells to sales. One of the eight wells brought online was a Company record, ultra-long lateral of 16,272 feet that met all timing, cost and initial production forecasts. The Company continues to increase its lateral lengths and plans to drill and complete more ultra-long laterals in 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)    The Fayetteville Shale E&P assets and associated reserves were divested on December 3, 2018. 

   (2)    Other reserves and acreage consists primarily of properties in Colorado. Production and capital investing includes Fayetteville Shale. 

   (3)    We have no reserves from synthetic gas, synthetic oil or nonrenewable natural resources intended to be upgraded into synthetic gas or oil. We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methodologies in determining estimates of material properties, including performance and test date analysis offset statistical analogy of performance data, volumetric evaluation, including analysis of petrophysical parameters (including porosity, net pay, fluid saturations (i.e., water, oil and gas) and permeability) in combination with estimated reservoir parameters (including reservoir temperature and pressure, formation depth and formation volume factors), geological analysis, including structure and isopach maps and seismic analysis, including review of 2-D and 3-D data to ascertain faults, closure and other factors. 

   (4)    Includes 243 Bcf of natural gas production related to our Fayetteville Shale operations which were sold on December 3, 2018. 

   (5)    Other capital investments includes $33 million related to our Fayetteville Shale operations which were sold on December 3, 2018, $60 million related to our water infrastructure project, $16 million related to our E&P service companies and $9 million related to our exploration activities. 

   (6)    Represents producing wells, including 394 wells in which we only have an overriding royalty interest in Northeast Appalachia, used in the December 31, 2018 reserves calculation. 

   (7)    Excludes exploration licenses for 2,518,519 net acres in New Brunswick, Canada, which have been subject to a moratorium since 2015. 

   (8)    Pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure) is one measure of the value of a company’s proved reserves that we believe is used by securities analysts to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. The reconciling difference in pre-tax PV-10 and the after-tax PV-10, or standardized measure, is the discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows from our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. 

   (9)    Based upon pre-tax PV-10 of proved developed producing activities.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results, the results of its peers and of prior periods.   

 One such non-GAAP financial measure is net cash flow. Management presents this measure because (i) it is accepted as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt, (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the Company may not control and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred.  

 Additional non-GAAP financial measures the Company may present from time to time are net debt, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and its E&P and Midstream segment operating income, all which exclude certain charges or amounts. Management presents these measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the Company’s position and performance are measured relative to the position and performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the Company excludes information regarding these types of items. These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
