Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

At a meeting held on February 26, 2019, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors of the registrant (the “Committee”) established corporate performance criteria that will be used to determine the amount of 2019 incentive compensation awards under the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). Corporate performance criteria are tied to Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Cash Flow Return on Gross Capital metrics. In addition to these quantitative goals, the Committee may also consider other performance factors in determining final awards. These include, but are not limited to, performance versus profit plan goals, performance versus that reported for the Company’s peers, and progress toward the execution of the corporation’s growth strategies. The Plan participants consist of the Executive Officers of Eaton Corporation and approximately 2,775 other salaried employees. At the same meeting, the Committee established 2019 incentive target amounts. The individual incentive targets for the current executive officers who were named in the summary compensation table of the registrant’s 2018 Proxy Statement (the “Named Executive Officers”) range from 75% to 160%. 

At the meeting, the Committee also established individual targets and approved grants for the Company’s long-term performance-based incentive program (“ESIP”) 2019-2021 Award Period. The 2019-2021 Award Period opportunities for the Named Executive Officers took the form of performance share units (“PSUs”) and grants at the target level range from 8,665 PSUs to 62,375 PSUs. The actual number of PSUs earned will depend upon the registrant’s total return to shareholders, assuming reinvestment of dividends (“TSR”), relative to that of a group of 20 peers approved by the Committee at the same meeting. Consistent with historical practices, participants can earn 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs.
