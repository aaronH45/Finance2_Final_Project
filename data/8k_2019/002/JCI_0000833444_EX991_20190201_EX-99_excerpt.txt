Non-GAAP Financial Information

The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The adjusting items include net mark-to-market adjustments, transaction/integration costs, restructuring and impairment costs, Scott Safety gain on sale, the impact of ceasing the depreciation/amortization expense for the Power Solutions business as the business is held for sale and discrete tax items. Financial information regarding organic sales, adjusted segment EBITA, adjusted organic segment EBITA, adjusted segment EBITA margin, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow conversion are also presented, which are non-GAAP performance measures. Adjusted segment EBITA excludes special items such as transaction/integration costs and Scott Safety gain on sale because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of its business units. Management believes that, when considered together with unadjusted amounts, these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results and business trends of the Company. Management may also use these metrics as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and for compensation purposes. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure.

FOOTNOTES

1. Financial Summary

The Company evaluates the performance of its business units primarily on segment earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA), which represents income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding general corporate expenses, intangible asset amortization, net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, and the net mark-to-market adjustments related to restricted asbestos investments and pension and postretirement plans. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company began reporting the Power Solutions business as a discontinued operation, which required retrospective application to previously reported financial information. As a result, the financial results shown below are for continuing operations and exclude the Power Solutions business. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted segment EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA margins, which are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company's definition of adjusted segment EBITA excludes special items because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of its businesses. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company. 

The following is the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 reconciliation of segment EBITA and segment EBITA margin as reported to adjusted segment EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA margin (unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(2) Adjusted Corporate expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2018 excludes $41 million of integration costs and $2 million of transaction costs. Adjusted Corporate expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 excludes $28 million of integration costs and $5 million of transaction costs. 

(3) On October 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." ASU No. 2016-01 amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including marketable securities. The new standard requires the mark-to-market of marketable securities investments previously recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income on the statement of financial position be recorded in the statement of income on a prospective basis beginning as of the adoption date. The three months ended December 31, 2018 exclude the net mark-to-market adjustments on restricted investments of $21 million. As these restricted investments do not relate to the underlying operating performance of its businesses, the Company’s definition of adjusted segment EBITA and adjusted EBIT excludes the mark-to-market adjustments effective October 1, 2018.

(4) Restructuring and impairment costs for the three months ended December 31, 2017 of $154 million are excluded from the adjusted non-GAAP results. The restructuring actions and impairment costs related primarily to workforce reductions, plant closures and asset impairments in the Building Technologies & Solutions business and at Corporate.

(5) Management defines earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) as income from continuing operations before net financing charges, income taxes and noncontrolling interests.

Page 11 of 14

(6) Adjusted income tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2018 excludes the tax provision for valuation allowance adjustments of $76 million as a result of changes in U.S. tax law, partially offset by the tax benefits for integration costs of $6 million and net mark-to-market adjustments of $5 million. Adjusted income tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2017 excludes the net tax provision related to the U.S. Tax Reform legislation of $204 million, the Scott Safety gain on sale of $30 million and the impact of the third quarter fiscal 2018 effective tax rate change of $6 million, partially offset by the tax benefits for tax audit settlements of $25 million, restructuring and impairment costs of $23 million, integration costs of $6 million and transaction costs of $1 million. 

2. Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation

The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The adjusting items include transaction/integration costs, gain on sale of the Scott Safety business, net mark-to-market adjustments, restructuring and impairment costs, impact of ceasing the depreciation / amortization expense for the Power Solutions business as the business is held for sale, and discrete tax items. The Company excludes these items because they are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of the Company. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company. 

A reconciliation of diluted earnings per share as reported to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the respective periods is shown below (unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* May not sum due to rounding.

The following table reconciles the denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share for JCI plc (in millions; unaudited): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the total number of potential dilutive shares due to stock options, unvested restricted stock and unvested performance share awards was 7.2 million. However, these items were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for the three months ended December 31, 2017, since to do so would decrease the loss per share for continuing operations. On an adjusted diluted outstanding share basis, inclusion of the effect of dilutive securities results in diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 933.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.

The Company has presented forward-looking statements regarding adjusted EPS from continuing operations, organic net sales growth, organic adjusted EBITA growth, organic adjusted EBIT growth, adjusted segment EBITA margin, adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted free cash flow conversion for the full fiscal year of 2019, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses, income or cash flows from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period, including but not limited to the high variability of the net mark-to-market adjustments and the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Our fiscal 2019 outlook for organic net sales and adjusted EBITA and EBIT growth also excludes the effect of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of the aforementioned forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s full year 2019 GAAP financial results.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation

The Company's press release contains financial information regarding free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow conversion, which are non-GAAP performance measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow excludes special items, as included in the table below, because these cash flows are not considered to be directly related to its underlying businesses. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is defined as adjusted free cash flow divided by adjusted net income. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash.

The following is the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 reconciliation of free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow conversion for continuing operations (unaudited):

5. Net Debt to Capitalization

The Company provides financial information regarding net debt as a percentage of total capitalization, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The Company believes the percentage of total net debt to total capitalization is useful to understanding the Company's financial condition as it provides a review of the extent to which the Company relies on external debt financing for its funding and is a measure of risk to its shareholders. The following is the December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018 calculation of net debt as a percentage of total capitalization (unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

6. Divestitures

On November 13, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Power Solutions business to BCP Acquisitions LLC for approximately $13.2 billion. BCP Acquisitions LLC is a newly-formed entity controlled by investment funds managed by Brookfield Capital Partners LLC. The transaction is expected to close by June 30, 2019, subject to investment closing conditions and required regulatory approvals. Net cash proceeds are expected to be $11.4 billion after tax and transaction-related expenses.

On March 16, 2017, the Company announced that it signed a definitive agreement to sell its Scott Safety business to 3M for approximately $2.0 billion. The transaction closed on October 4, 2017. Net cash proceeds from the transaction approximated $1.9 billion and the Company recorded a net gain of $114 million ($84 million after tax). Scott Safety is a leader in the design, manufacture and sale of high performance respiratory protection, gas and flame detection, thermal imaging and other critical products for fire services, law enforcement, industrial, oil and gas, chemical, armed forces, and homeland defense end markets. 

7. Income Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations before consideration of transaction/integration costs, gain on sale of the Scott Safety business, net mark-to-market adjustments, restructuring and impairment costs, and discrete tax items for the three months ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 is approximately 13.5% and 12.1%, respectively.
