CEO Comments

Mark Clouse, Campbell’s President and CEO stated, “I am pleased that, for the second consecutive quarter, we delivered sales and earnings performance in line with our expectations, enabling us to reaffirm our full-year guidance for fiscal 2019.

“During the quarter, we continued to make progress against key strategic initiatives. Our efforts to stabilize our core business, integrate Snyder's-Lance, deliver our cost savings agenda and focus and optimize the portfolio are all on track. Over time, these actions will enable us to increase investments in our core businesses while significantly reducing debt and creating meaningful value for shareholders. While we have made steady progress, there is much more work to be done to fully unlock the potential of our business.

“Since joining the team and immersing myself in Campbell’s business, I am confident in the plans in place to address our near-in challenges and opportunities, with the commitment to set a clear strategic roadmap for the future. I am excited by the opportunities to build upon the company’s solid foundation of iconic brands, talented employees, engaged customers and loyal consumers. It is upon these strengths that we will continue to create a compelling plan that delivers profitable and sustainable growth, supported by a reenergized culture focused on accountability, performance and consumer-driven marketing and innovation.”

Items Impacting Comparability 

The table below presents a summary of items impacting comparability in each period. A detailed reconciliation of the reported (GAAP) financial information to the adjusted information is included at the end of this news release.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Numbers do not add due to rounding.

Second-Quarter Results 

Sales increased 24 percent to $2.7 billion reflecting a 26-point benefit from the recent acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods. Organic sales, which exclude the negative 

2

impact of currency translation, were comparable to the prior year as gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks were offset by declines in Campbell Fresh and Meals and Beverages. Sales in the quarter benefited by approximately 50 basis points from the change in revenue recognition adopted in fiscal 2019, which impacts the timing of expense related to promotional programs. The annual impact is not expected to be material.

Gross margin decreased from 35.1 percent to 26.3 percent. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted gross margin decreased 4.3 percentage points to 30.9 percent, including a 200-basis-point dilutive mix impact from the recent acquisitions. The remaining decline in adjusted gross margin was driven primarily by cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, as well as higher promotional investment, offset partly by productivity improvements and the benefits from cost savings initiatives. The increase in supply chain costs was driven primarily by higher warehousing and transportation costs, the majority of which were principally one-time in nature.

Marketing and selling expenses increased 16 percent to $264 million reflecting a 22-point increase from the inclusion of the recent acquisitions. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year and the impact of the recent acquisitions, adjusted marketing and selling expenses decreased driven primarily by lower marketing overhead and selling expenses, including the benefits from cost savings initiatives. Administrative expenses increased 9 percent to $180 million. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted administrative expenses increased 15 percent to $160 million primarily due to the inclusion of the recent acquisitions.

Other expenses were $226 million as compared to $70 million in the prior year. Excluding items impacting comparability, other income decreased from $29 million in the prior year to $5 million reflecting amortization of intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions and lower gains on investments.

As reported EBIT was $19 million. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EBIT decreased 1 percent to $399 million driven by declines in the base business, offset mostly by incremental earnings from our recent acquisitions. The change in revenue recognition had a favorable 3-point impact in the quarter.

3

Net interest expense was $92 million compared to $32 million in the prior year reflecting higher levels of debt associated with the recent acquisitions and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio. The tax rate was 19.2 percent as compared to a negative 35.1 percent in the prior year. Excluding items impacting comparability, the adjusted tax rate increased 5.2 percentage points from 18.9 percent to 24.1 percent. The adjusted tax rate in the prior-year quarter benefited from a year-to-date true-up to reflect the lower U.S. federal tax rate as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.

The company reported a loss of $0.20 per share. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EPS decreased 23 percent to $0.77 per share reflecting EBIT declines in the base business, a higher adjusted tax rate, and the expected dilutive impact from the acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods. The change in revenue recognition had a favorable $0.03 per share impact in the quarter.

First-Half Results 

Sales increased 25 percent to $5.4 billion reflecting a 27-point benefit from the recent acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods. Organic sales declined 2 percent.

As reported EBIT decreased 44 percent to $369 million. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EBIT decreased 1 percent to $811 million reflecting declines in the base business offset mostly by incremental earnings from recent acquisitions.

Net interest expense was $185 million compared to $62 million in the prior year reflecting higher levels of debt associated with the recent acquisitions and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio. The tax rate increased from 5.6 percent to 26.6 percent. Excluding items impacting comparability, the adjusted tax rate increased 0.5 percentage points from 23.8 percent to 24.3 percent. 

The company reported EPS of $0.45. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EPS decreased 18 percent to $1.57 per share primarily reflecting adjusted EBIT declines in the base business. 

Cash flow from operations increased to $846 million from $660 million a year ago reflecting significant improvements from the company’s working capital management efforts and wrapping 

4

payments last year on hedges associated with an anticipated debt issuance, offset partly by lower cash earnings. In line with the company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders, during the first half of fiscal 2019, the company paid $212 million of cash dividends reflecting the quarterly dividend rate of $0.35 per share. 

Campbell Reaffirms Fiscal 2019 Guidance

Following second-quarter results, Campbell continues to expect full-year performance to be consistent with guidance provided on Aug. 30, 2018. As previously announced, given the strategy to pursue divestitures, the company has provided an outlook for fiscal 2019 based on the company’s existing portfolio of businesses, as well as on a pro forma basis assuming the planned divestitures are completed as of the beginning of fiscal 2019. This fiscal 2019 guidance and pro forma, as shown in the table below, include the impact of the Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods acquisitions and an estimated 1 percentage-point negative impact from currency translation. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Adjusted - refer to the detailed reconciliation of the reported (GAAP) financial information to the adjusted financial information at the end of this news release. 

Note: A non-GAAP reconciliation is not provided for 2019 guidance or 2019 pro forma since certain items are not estimable, such as pension and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments, and these items are not considered to reflect the company's ongoing business results. The pro forma scenario is provided for illustrative purposes to provide approximate impact of potential divestitures as if they occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2019 and is based on the use of estimated sales proceeds.

Cost Savings Program 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Campbell achieved $50 million in savings under its multi-year cost savings program, inclusive of Snyder’s-Lance synergies, bringing total program-to-date savings to $550 million. Year-to-date savings of $95 million through the first half of fiscal 2019 are pacing slightly ahead of schedule, helping to offset other cost pressures. As previously announced, the company expects to deliver cumulative annualized savings of $945 million by the end of fiscal 2022.

Meals and Beverages

Sales in the quarter increased 1 percent to $1.230 billion. Organic sales decreased 1 percent reflecting mixed results, as increases in beverages behind consumption gains in V8 vegetable juice and V8 Energy were more than offset by declines in Plum, Canada and Prego pasta sauces. Excluding the benefit from the acquisition of Pacific Foods, sales of U.S. soup were comparable to the prior year with gains in ready-to-serve soups and broth, offset by declines in condensed soups. 

Segment operating earnings decreased 10 percent to $255 million. The decrease was driven primarily by higher levels of cost inflation and higher warehousing and transportation costs, which began to moderate in January, as well as higher promotional spending, offset partly by lower marketing and selling expenses.

Global Biscuits and Snacks 

Sales in the quarter increased 76 percent to $1.243 billion. Excluding the benefit from the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance and the negative impact of currency translation, organic sales increased 3 percent. This performance reflects continued growth in Pepperidge Farm, driven by solid consumption gains in Pepperidge Farm fresh bakery products and Goldfish crackers, as well as growth in Arnott’s biscuits, fueled by innovation. Sales of Pepperidge Farm have now grown in 17 consecutive quarters.

Segment operating earnings increased 35 percent to $185 million, reflecting a 34-point benefit from the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, segment operating earnings increased slightly driven primarily by volume gains, offset partly by higher levels of cost inflation.

Campbell Fresh

Overall performance for the Campbell Fresh segment was consistent with expectations. Sales in the quarter decreased 7 percent to $239 million driven by expected declines in refrigerated soup, reflecting the previously announced plans of certain major private label customers to insource production in 2019, as well as declines in Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and Garden Fresh Gourmet, offset partly by gains in carrots. 

7

Segment operating loss was $14 million compared to a loss of $11 million in the prior year. The $3 million year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the decline in refrigerated soup volume, offset partly by improved operational efficiency in the Bolthouse Farms business. 

Corporate 

Corporate in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 included non-cash impairment charges of $346 million related to the Campbell Fresh segment, charges related to cost savings initiatives of $22 million, and costs associated with planned divestitures of $10 million. Corporate in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 included a non-cash impairment charge of $75 million related to the Campbell Fresh segment, charges related to cost savings initiatives of $27 million, and acquisition transaction costs of $24 million. The remaining increase in expenses primarily reflects the wrapping of gains on investments in the prior-year quarter and higher administrative expenses.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Second Quarter Ended January 27, 2019

Campbell Soup Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in certain communications. These non-GAAP financial measures are measures of performance not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, GAAP reported measures. Management believes that also presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of the company's historical operating results and trends in its underlying operating results, and provides transparency on how the company evaluates its business. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. 

Organic Net Sales

Organic net sales are net sales excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions. Management believes that excluding these items, which are not part of the ongoing business, improves the comparability of year-to-year results. A reconciliation of net sales as reported to organic net sales follows.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Items Impacting Earnings

The company believes that financial information excluding certain items that are not considered to reflect the ongoing operating results, such as those listed below, improves the comparability of year-to-year results. Consequently, the company believes that investors may be able to better understand its results excluding these items.

The following items impacted earnings:

(1)In fiscal 2015, the company implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline its organizational structure. In fiscal 2017, the company expanded these cost savings initiatives by further optimizing its supply chain network, primarily in North America, continuing to evolve its operating model to drive efficiencies, and more fully integrating its recent acquisitions. In January 2018, as part of the expanded initiatives, the company authorized additional costs to improve the operational efficiency of its thermal supply chain network in North America by closing its manufacturing facility in Toronto, Ontario, and to optimize its information technology infrastructure by migrating certain applications to the latest cloud technology platform. In August 2018, the company announced that it will continue to streamline its 

17

organization, expand its zero-based budgeting efforts and optimize its manufacturing network. In fiscal 2019, the company began to include costs associated with the Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration with these initiatives.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the company recorded Restructuring charges of $2 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $10 million in Administrative expenses, $9 million in Cost of products sold, $2 million in Marketing and selling expenses, and $1 million in Research and development expenses (aggregate impact of $18 million after tax, or $.06 per share) related to these initiatives. In the six-month period of fiscal 2019, the company recorded Restructuring charges of $21 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $23 million in Administrative expenses, $21 million in Cost of products sold, $4 million in Marketing and selling expenses, and $1 million in Research and development expenses (aggregate impact of $53 million after tax, or $.18 per share) related to these initiatives. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recorded Restructuring charges of $33 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $26 million in Administrative expenses and $1 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $46 million after tax, or $.15 per share) related to these initiatives. In the six-month period of fiscal 2018, the company recorded Restructuring charges of $35 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $38 million in Administrative expenses and $6 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $58 million after tax, or $.19 per share) related to these initiatives. For the year ended July 29, 2018, the company recorded Restructuring charges of $49 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $88 million in Administrative expenses, $45 million in Cost of products sold, and $3 million in Marketing and selling expenses (aggregate impact of $136 million after tax, or $.45 per share) related to these initiatives.

(2)In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, interim impairment assessments were performed on the intangible and tangible assets within Campbell Fresh, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet, Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients, and Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, as the company continues to pursue the divestiture of these businesses. The company revised its future outlook for earnings and cash flows for each of these businesses as the divestiture process progressed. 

The company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $104 million on the tangible assets and $73 million on the intangible assets of Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients; $96 million on the intangible assets and $9 million on the tangible assets of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings; and $62 million on the intangible assets and $2 million on the tangible assets of Garden Fresh Gourmet. The aggregate impact of the impairment charges was $346 million, of which $115 million was recorded in Cost of products sold and $231 in Other expenses / (income), ($264 million after tax, or $.88 per share). In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14 million in Cost of products sold ($11 million after tax, or $.04 per share) on its U.S. refrigerated soup plant assets. For the six-month period of fiscal 2019, the total non-cash impairment charges recorded were $360 million, of which $129 million was recorded in Cost of products sold and $231 million in Other expenses / (income), ($275 million after tax, or $.91 per share).

In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations. The company revised its outlook for future earnings and cash flows and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $75 million in Other expenses / (income) ($74 million after tax, or $.25 per share). 

In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company performed interim impairment assessments within Campbell Fresh on the deli reporting unit, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business, and the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. Within the deli unit, the company revised its long-term outlook due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with certain private label customers, as well as the performance of the business. In addition, the operating performance of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit was below expectations. The company revised its long-term outlook for future earnings and cash flows for each of these reporting units. The company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11 million on the tangible assets and $94 million on the intangible assets ($80 million after tax, or $.27 per share) of the deli reporting unit, and a non-cash impairment charge of $514 million ($417 million after tax, or $1.39 per share) related to the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. The aggregate impact of the impairment charges was $619 million, of which $11 million was recorded in Cost of products sold and $608 million in Other expenses / (income), ($497 million after tax, or $1.65 per share). 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company performed an impairment assessment on the Plum trademark. In fiscal 2018, sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team 

18

and based on recent performance, the company lowered its long-term outlook for future sales. The company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $54 million ($41 million after tax, or $.14 per share) in Other expenses / (income).

For the year ended July 29, 2018, the total non-cash impairment charges recorded were $748 million, of which $11 million was recorded in Cost of products sold and $737 million in Other expenses / (income), ($612 million after tax, or $2.03 per share.

(3)In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the company announced its intent to divest its Campbell International and Campbell Fresh businesses. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the company incurred costs of $10 million recorded in Administrative expenses ($8 million after tax, or $.03 per share) associated with the planned divestitures. In the six-month period of fiscal 2019, the company incurred costs of $12 million recorded in Administrative expenses ($9 million after tax, or $.03 per share) associated with the planned divestitures.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recorded a tax benefit of $183 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a tax charge of $59 million related to a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings.

(5)In the six-month period of fiscal 2018, the company incurred gains of $14 million in Other expenses / (income) ($10 million after tax, or $.03 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans.
