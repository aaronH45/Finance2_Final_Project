 Signet Jewelers Updates Timing of Fiscal 2019 Fourth Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call  

 HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 7, 2019--Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE: SIG) today announced that it intends to announce its fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2019 financial results at approximately 7:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, April 3, 2019 and hold a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET versus the previously announced date of March 14, 2019.  

 The change in dates is being made principally to allow sufficient time for management to complete its analysis in connection with its annual report for Fiscal 2019 of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, resulting from a decline in the Company’s market capitalization during the thirteen weeks ended February 2, 2019.  

 Given that an impairment charge would be non-cash, the Company does not expect any such impairment charge to affect its liquidity or affect cash flows from operating activities.  

 Details for the April 3, 2019 conference call following announcement of fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2019 results are below and there will be a simultaneous audio webcast available at www.signetjewelers.com.
