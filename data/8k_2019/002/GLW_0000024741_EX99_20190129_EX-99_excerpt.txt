 Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework Progress  

 ﻿  

 The Framework outlines the company’s 2016-2019 leadership priorities. Under the Framework, Corning plans to deliver more than $12.5 billion to shareholders while investing $10 billion in growth opportunities. Since it was announced in October 2015, the company has achieved key milestones including the return of $11.8 billion to shareholders through dividends, which have increased 50%, and share repurchases, which have reduced outstanding shares by 36%.   

 ﻿  

  “As we enter the final year under the Framework, the strategic and financial benefits of Corning’s cohesive portfolio are clear,” Weeks said. “We’re especially pleased with the significant achievements across our market-access platforms.”   

 ﻿  

 Highlights of progress in Corning’s market-access platforms include:   

   ·    Optical Communications: Secured contracts with industry leaders in the carrier and data center segments that will add significant sales in 2019 and beyond, and expanded market access through the acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division;

 Segment Results and Outlook   

 ﻿  

 “We had another outstanding quarter, and our full-year results exceeded our expectations,” said Tony Tripeny, executive vice president and chief financial officer. “In 2018, we did what we said we were going to do, which was to expand our manufacturing capacity in the first half and begin leveraging those growth investments in the second half. In 2019, we expect to build on this momentum and keep growing across all of our businesses.”

Display Technologies:   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Full-year sales in Display Technologies were $3.3 billion, and net income was $835 million. During 2018, Corning extended its global leadership by successfully ramping Gen 10.5 production, which allowed the company to grow volume faster than the overall market. Pricing improved as anticipated to a mid-single-digit percentage decline year over year in both the third and fourth quarters of 2018.

Fourth-quarter sales were $899 million, and net income was $240 million. In the fourth quarter, display glass market volume grew by a low-single-digit percentage sequentially and Corning’s volume grew more. 

For full-year 2019, Corning expects display glass market volume to grow by a mid-single digit percentage. The company expects its volume to grow more than the market, resulting from the ramp of its Gen 10.5 facility during 2018. Annual Display glass price declines are expected to be a mid-single-digit percentage, an improvement over 2018. 

In the first quarter, price declines are expected to remain moderate and be the most favorable first-quarter price change in over a decade. Volume is expected to be down by a mid-single digit percentage sequentially, consistent with the market, which typically declines in the first quarter.

Optical Communications:

 ﻿  

 Optical Communications full-year sales were $4.2 billion, up 18% for the second consecutive year. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. Net income was up 26% year over year. Fourth-quarter sales exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter and were up 26% year over year. Net income for the quarter rose 67% over 2017.  

 ﻿  

 The company expects another year of growth in Optical Communications in 2019. Specifically, full-year sales are expected to be up by a low-teens percentage, with first-quarter sales up in the low-20 percent range year over year.

Environmental Technologies:   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Environmental Technologies 2018 sales were $1.3 billion, up 17% year over year, driven by growth in all product categories and emerging sales of GPFs. Net income grew faster than sales at 26% year over year. Fourth-quarter sales grew 10% year over year.  

 ﻿  

 For 2019, Environmental sales are expected to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the first quarter and by a high-single-digit percentage for the full year.

Specialty Materials:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Specialty Materials 2018 sales were in line with expectations, after an exceptionally strong year of 25% sales growth in 2017. Full-year sales rose 5% as OEMs continued to adopt glass backs and Corning’s portfolio of premium glass products. Fourth-quarter sales were $399 million, up 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2017.   

 ﻿  

 The company expects year-over-year sales growth for Specialty Materials in 2019, with the rate and pace dependent on customer adoption of Corning’s innovations. First-quarter sales are expected to increase by a mid-to high-single-digit percentage year over year.

 Presentation of Information in this News Release  

 Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company’s operations.

 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 ﻿  

 CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES  

 In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at core performance measures. These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Additionally, Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and New Taiwan dollar currencies. The Company believes that the use of constant currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows. Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.   

 ﻿  

 These measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the Company’s outlooks for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan or New Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.  

 ﻿  

 For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below. See “Items which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at Core performance measures” for details on core performance measures.

 Items which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at Core performance measures are as follows:  

 ﻿  

   (1)    Constant-currency adjustments: Because a significant portion of Display Technologies segment revenues are denominated in Japanese yen, and a significant portion of Display Technologies segment manufacturing costs are denominated in Japanese Yen, Korean Won, New Taiwan Dollar and Chinese yuan, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings of translating these currencies into U.S. Dollars. Presenting results on a constant-currency basis mitigates their translation impact and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts.   

   ﻿    Constant-yen: As of January 1, 2018, we use an internally derived management rate of ¥107, which is closely aligned to our current yen portfolio of foreign currency hedges, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the Japanese yen.   

   ﻿    Constant-won: As of January 1, 2018, we use an internally derived management rate of ₩1,175, which is consistent with historical prior period averages of the won, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate.   

   ﻿    Constant-yuan: In January 2018, we began presenting results of the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments on a constant-yuan basis to mitigate the translation impact of this currency on these segments. We use an internally derived management rate of yuan 6.7, which is closely aligned to our current yuan portfolio of foreign currency hedges and consistent with historical prior period averages.   

   ﻿    Constant-Taiwan dollar: In January 2018, we began presenting results of the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments on a constant-Taiwan dollar basis to mitigate the translation impact of this currency on these segments. We use an internally derived management rate of Taiwan dollar 31, which is closely aligned to our current Taiwan dollar portfolio of foreign currency hedges, and approximates the 10-year historical average of the currency.   

   (2)    Translation (gain) loss on Japanese yen-denominated debt: We have excluded the (gain) loss on the translation of our Yen-denominated debt to U.S. dollars.   

   (3)    Translated earnings contract (gain) loss: We have excluded the impact of the realized and unrealized gains and losses of our Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and Taiwan dollar-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings, as well as the unrealized gains and losses of our euro and British pound-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings.   

   (4)    Acquisition-related costs: These expenses include intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs.   

   (5)    Discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: For 2018, this amount primarily relates to the preliminary IRS audit settlement. For 2017, this amount represents the removal of discrete adjustments (e.g. changes in tax law and changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets) as well as other non-operational tax-related adjustments.   

   (6)    Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: Includes amounts that reflect developments in commercial litigation, intellectual property disputes and other legal matters.   

   (7)    Restructuring, impairment and other charges: This amount includes restructuring, impairment and other charges, as well as other expenses which are not related to continuing operations and are not classified as restructuring expense.   

   (8)    Equity in earnings of affiliated companies: These adjustments relate to items which do not reflect on-going operating results of our affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges and settlements under “take-or-pay” contracts.   

   (9)    Adjustments related to acquisitions: Includes fair value adjustments to the Corning Precision Materials indemnity asset related to contingent consideration, post-combination expenses and other acquisition and disposal adjustments.   

   (10)    Pension mark-to-market adjustment: Defined benefit pension mark-to-market gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates.   

   (11)    Adjustments to remove the impact of the Tax Cuts and Job Act: Includes a provisional amount related to the one-time mandatory tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, a provisional amount related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in valuation allowances as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, and adjustments for the elimination of foreign tax credits.
