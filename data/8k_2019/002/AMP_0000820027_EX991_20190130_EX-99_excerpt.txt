 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Ameriprise Financial Center Minneapolis, MN 55474 News Release Ameriprise Financial Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Results Fourth quarter 2018 net income per diluted share was $3.76 Adjusted operating EPS excluding items (1) was $3.80 Full year 2018 net income per diluted share was $14.20 Adjusted operating EPS excluding items (1) was $14.94 Fourth quarter 2018 return on equity excluding AOCI was 36.0 percent Adjusted operating ROE excluding AOCI and items (1) was 37.8 percent MINNEAPOLIS – January 30, 2018 – Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported fourth quarter 2018 net income of $539 million, or $3.76 per diluted share. Adjusted operating earnings excluding items(1) increased 12 percent to $544 million, with adjusted operating earnings per diluted share excluding items(1) up 21 percent to $3.80. Significant equity and interest rate volatility resulted in non-cash mean reversion-related impacts of an unfavorable $56 million after-tax in the Annuities and Protection segments in the current quarter compared to a $13 million favorable after-tax impact in the prior year quarter. Full year 2018 net income per diluted share was $14.20. Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share excluding items(1) increased 27 percent to $14.94. “Ameriprise delivered solid results in a volatile quarter with our Advice and Wealth Management business driving our growth,” said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. “Ameriprise client flows into fee- based investment advisory remained strong and cash balances increased. As we serve more clients in advice relationships, we’re steadily growing advisor productivity.” “Equity market declines globally were clear challenges. U.S. equity markets declined 14 percent in the quarter, which impacted our average assets and related fees, increased non-cash annuity expenses and heightened industry-wide asset management outflows. These market challenges also create opportunities for Ameriprise as they reinforce the need for personal financial planning and advice, where we are a long-standing leader, and demonstrate a key differentiation—our balance sheet strength and effective capital management. “Our capital strength allows us to continue to invest for near- and long-term growth and capture opportunities, including delivering relevant, quality products and solutions, exceptional service to our retail and institutional clients and accelerating our share repurchase in the fourth quarter. For the year, we returned more than $2 billion to shareholders through an increased dividend and repurchase of 11 million shares while maintaining our balance sheet strength. We will continue to benefit from our capital and expense discipline as we manage a challenging market environment and further strengthen our market position.” (1) Excludes the one-time negative impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) in the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as unlocking and mean reversion-related items in both periods, as applicable. There are two primary mean reversion-related items that are influenced by markets—increased DAC and DSIC amortization and increased reserve accrual for SOP 03-1 reserves for living benefit guarantees—both of which drove the non-cash mean reversion-related impacts in the quarter. Unlocking impacts reflect the company’s annual 1 review of insurance and annuity valuation assumptions and model changes, and the Long Term Care (LTC) gross premium valuation.  

GAAP Results – Fourth quarter Net revenues were $3.2 billion reflecting growth in Advice & Wealth Management offset by market dislocation in the quarter. Expenses of $2.5 billion decreased 2 percent, or $58 million, from a year ago. Adjusted Operating Results – Fourth quarter Adjusted operating net revenues of $3.2 billion were flat to last year excluding the Tax Act, driven by continued strength in Advice & Wealth Management, which was offset by lower Asset Management revenue. Adjusted operating expenses were $2.6 billion. Excluding mean reversion-related impacts, adjusted operating expenses decreased 2 percent versus last year. General and administrative expense decreased 5 percent reflecting ongoing growth investments that were more than offset by continued expense discipline and lower compensation-related expenses. Taxes The adjusted operating effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.9 percent and was within expectations. The lower effective tax rate reflects the continued reduction in the federal income tax rate. 2

Fourth Quarter 2018 Highlights Ameriprise delivered solid financial results and maintained a strong balance sheet and capital position during a period of volatile markets and returned $564 million to shareholders . Adjusted operating earnings per share excluding items(1) increased 21 percent in the quarter, and adjusted operating return on equity, excluding items(1) and AOCI reached 37.8 percent. . Equity markets declined significantly in the fourth quarter with the company’s weighted equity index declining 14 percent point-to-point and 7 percent on average sequentially. The point-to-point decline drove significant negative mean reversion-related impacts. In addition, market depreciation drove lower average assets under management and administration in the quarter that impacted asset management fees and, to a lesser extent, lower fees for Advice & Wealth Management. . General and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent from focused expense discipline. . In the quarter, the company accelerated its share repurchase program with 3.6 million shares of common stock repurchased, up 50 percent from 2.4 million in the third quarter. The company repurchased $436 million of stock and paid $128 million in quarterly dividends, which represented 104 percent of adjusted operating earnings(1). For the full year, Ameriprise repurchased 7 percent of shares outstanding and increased the dividend 8 percent. Balance sheet fundamentals remain strong with substantial free cash flow generation and excellent risk management discipline. . Excess capital was $1.5 billion, with an estimated risk-based capital ratio of approximately 500 percent. The firm’s comprehensive and personal client focus, combined with its broad solution set, resulted in strong wealth management flows in a challenging market environment . Ameriprise assets under management and administration were $823 billion, reflecting advisor client net inflows that were more than offset by market depreciation and asset management outflows. . Ameriprise retail client assets were $539 billion, reflecting continued strength in investment advisory (wrap) net inflows that partially offset market depreciation in the fourth quarter. . Client demand for fee-based investment advisory products remains strong with net inflows of $4.5 billion in the quarter—the seventh consecutive quarter of wrap net inflows over $4 billion. Wrap assets grew to $251 billion, one of the largest platforms in the industry. . The company made continued progress on its plan to offer a range of banking and credit products by submitting applications to the Federal Reserve and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to convert its wholly owned OCC-chartered trust bank subsidiary to a federal savings bank. . Advisor productivity increased 9 percent to $620,000 per advisor on a trailing 12-month basis after normalizing for the net impact from eliminating 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, reflecting the continuation of growth in advisor productivity over multiple years, our comprehensive, advice-based approach to serving clients and strong advisor retention. . Columbia Threadneedle assets under management declined to $431 billion from equity market depreciation and elevated outflows, consistent with the industry. . Variable annuity cash sales were $1 billion and for the full year cash sales increased 6 percent to $4.5 billion, in line with historic ranges. (1) Excludes the one-time negative impact from the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as unlocking and mean reversion-related impacts in both periods. 4  

Ameriprise continued to invest to drive productivity, business growth and client satisfaction . The Ameriprise Financial brand and value proposition continues to resonate in the marketplace with consumer awareness remaining at a high level. Ameriprise launched new advertising as part of the evolution of its successful Be Brilliant® advertising and brand platform, highlighting the personalized, differentiated experience the firm deliver to clients. . Ameriprise continues to invest in expanding its distribution network by adding experienced advisors with strong productivity. 93 experienced advisors joined the firm during the quarter, bringing the advisor count to 9,931. Values-based, client-focused firm .

 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Advice & Wealth Management Segment Adjusted Operating Results Quarter Ended December 31, % Better/ (in millions, unaudited) 2018 2017 (Worse) Advice & Wealth Management Net revenues $ 1,581 $ 1,509 5 % Expenses 1,213 1,184 (2 )% Pretax adjusted operating earnings $ 368 $ 325 13 % Pretax adjusted operating margin 23.3 % 21.5 % Quarter Ended December 31, % Better/ 2018 2017 (Worse) Retail client assets (billions) $ 539 $ 560 (4 )% Wrap net flows (billions) $ 4.5 $ 5.0 (10 )% Brokerage cash balance (billions) $ 27.7 $ 26.2 6 % Adjusted operating net revenue per advisor normalizing for the net impact of 12b-1 fee changes (trailing 12 months - thousands) $ 620 $ 569 9 % Advice & Wealth Management pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 13 percent to $368 million driven by continued strength in client net inflows and increased earnings on cash balances partially offset by markets. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 23.3 percent, up 180 basis points from a year ago. On a sequential basis, pretax adjusted operating earnings were up 4 percent and margin increased 60 basis points, as strong client flows and higher earnings on cash balances more than offset lower fees from the equity market decline in the quarter. Advice & Wealth Management represented 52 percent of the company’s pretax adjusted operating earnings(1). Adjusted operating net revenues increased 5 percent to $1.6 billion, despite flat average equity markets year- over-year, reflecting strong client activity, increased advisor productivity and higher earnings on cash balances. Management and financial advice fees in the quarter were impacted by lower average equity markets given fees for advisory accounts are assessed based primarily on average daily balances. Adjusted operating expenses increased 2 percent to $1.2 billion. General and administrative expenses were up 2 percent compared to a year ago primarily due to investments in growth initiatives and disciplined management of the expense base. Total retail client assets decreased 4 percent to $539 billion. Client net inflows remained strong and client acquisition momentum continued, and this mitigated approximately half of the decline in retail client assets from the point-to-point market depreciation in the fourth quarter. Total wrap assets increased 1 percent to $251 billion from continued strong wrap net inflows that more than offset market depreciation. Client brokerage cash balances were $27.7 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago as clients prepared for tax season and responded to the volatile market environment by accumulating cash. Adjusted operating net revenue per advisor on a trailing 12-month basis increased 9 percent to $620,000 after normalizing for the net impact from eliminating 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts. Total advisors increased to 9,931 and advisor retention remained strong. 93 experienced advisors moved their practices to Ameriprise in the quarter, with higher productivity than last year’s experienced advisor recruits.

Adjusted operating net revenue and pretax adjusted operating earnings were lower as a result of lower performance fees, markets and the cumulative impact of outflows. The level of performance fees and CLO unwinds were elevated in the prior year, with a lower benefit in the current period. The quarter also included $8 million of costs associated with the implementation of the company’s Brexit strategy. General and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent from lower performance fee compensation and $8 million of higher Brexit related costs. Adjusting for these items, general and administrative expenses declined 6 percent. Fourth quarter net pretax adjusted operating margin was 35 percent. On a sequential basis, earnings declined $44 million, half of which was related to lower asset-based fees from equity market declines, as well as $9 million of lower performance fees and $8 million of Brexit-related costs. Total segment AUM declined 13 percent, reflecting the 14 percent point-to-point market decline in the quarter and continued outflows. Net outflows in the quarter were elevated at $4.7 billion reflecting significant market dislocation in both the U.S. and EMEA. Retail fund outflow rates in the quarter were consistent with other active managers and reflected weakened market sentiment across all regions related to heightened market volatility from global economic concerns and Brexit, as well as higher year-end tax selling. Third party institutional outflows reflected lower sales and higher redemptions of equity and fixed income mandates. Outflows from former-parent company relationships increased primarily related to the market environment. 7

Variable annuity pretax adjusted operating earnings were $115 million, excluding the $68 million unfavorable mean reversion-related impacts, which are calculated based on the change in ending market level. There are two primary mean reversion-related impacts that are influenced by markets: increased DAC and DSIC amortization and increased accruals for SOP 03-1 reserves for living benefit guarantees, both of which drove the non-cash mean reversion-related impacts in the quarter. Underlying performance remained within expectations. Variable annuity account balances were $72 billion. Variable annuity net amount at risk as a percent of account values was 1.7 percent for living benefits and 1.6 percent for death benefits, which increased in the quarter but remained one of the lowest among major variable annuity writers. Fixed annuity pretax adjusted operating earnings were $4 million, reflecting continued spread compression from the extended period of low interest rates and lower account balances, as well as lower income annuity mortality rates. Account balances declined 7 percent from limited new product sales and continued lapses. 8
