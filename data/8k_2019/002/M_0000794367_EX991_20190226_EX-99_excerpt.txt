Financial Highlights

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Net sales performance is provided on a 52-week basis in 2018 compared to a 53-week basis in 2017. Comparable sales performance is provided on a 52-week basis in both 2018 and 2017. Comparable sales adjusted for the impact of the 53rd week reflect a shift of the company’s 2017 calendar to align with 2018 on a like-for-like basis.

**As adjusted reflects the exclusion of certain items from the respective financial measures. Please see the final pages of this news release for important information regarding the nature of such excluded amounts and calculation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures.

“2018 was an important year for Macy’s, Inc. as we changed the trajectory of the company and delivered positive comparable sales for the full year. I’m pleased with the impact of our strategic initiatives, particularly as they gained traction in the back half of the year,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy's, Inc. chairman & chief executive officer. “Looking at the fourth quarter of 2018, while we delivered positive comparable sales against what was a strong holiday season in 2017, results were lower than our expectations. We experienced another quarter of double-digit growth in digital. We also saw continued improvement in our brick and mortar trends with the Growth50 stores outperforming the fleet.”

“We know that when we listen to our customers, we win. And when we invest in our business, we grow. In 2019, we will continue with a balanced investment approach, and we are confident that Macy’s, Inc. is on the right path to deliver sustainable, profitable growth," continued Gennette. 

“The North Star Strategy is working. Macy’s is heading into 2019 a stronger business than we were a year ago - with healthier stores, a growing e-commerce business and a mobile experience that is resonating with our customers. We are executing a balanced investment strategy that supports all three of these components, with investment directed towards areas we know have the highest returns,” said Gennette. “We are also a more agile and flexible organization. The steps we are announcing to further streamline our management structure will allow us to move faster, reduce costs and be more responsive to changing customer expectations. Importantly, these changes build the foundation we need to achieve meaningful enterprise productivity improvements. These actions impact colleagues who have made strong contributions to the company over the years, and I thank them for their service.” 

Asset Sale Gains

Asset sale gains for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $278 million pre-tax, or $204 million after-tax and $0.65 per diluted share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. This compares to the fourth quarter of 2017, when asset sale gains totaled $368 million pre-tax, or $230 million after-tax and $0.75 per diluted share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. 

In the fourth quarter of 2018, Macy’s, Inc. completed the sale of the former I. Magnin building in Union Square San Francisco for $250 million of cash proceeds and a gain of $178 million. Following the transaction, the Macy’s Union Square store will comprise approximately 700,000 gross square feet. Macy’s Union Square is one of the company’s flagship properties, and this transaction is part of a multi-year plan to invest in further enhancing the customer experience in the store.

Asset sale gains for fiscal 2018 totaled $389 million pre-tax, or $287 million after-tax and $0.92 per diluted share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. This compares to 2017 when asset sale gains totaled $544 million pre-tax, or $338 million after-tax and $1.10 per diluted share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. 

2018 Strategic Initiatives Update

The company’s five key strategic initiatives of the North Star Strategy performed well for the year. Highlights include: 

•Loyalty: Improved benefits to Macy’s Star Rewards member loyalty program led to increased loyalty penetration with platinum members, with platinum spend up 10%. The company also launched a tender-neutral option, which added more than three million new members to the loyalty program. 

•Backstage: Opened Backstage, Macy’s on-mall, off-price business, in more than 120 new locations within Macy’s stores. For all Backstage store within a store locations, the average lift was more than 5% in the total store.

•Store Pickup: Expanded “Buy Online Pickup in Store” (BOPS), launched “Buy Online Ship to Store” (BOSS) feature, and built "At Your Service" centers in all stores. The company maintained approximately 25% associated sales on BOPS and BOSS orders.

•Vendor Direct: Expanded vendor direct program on macys.com, nearly doubling online SKUs.

•Growth50: Implemented growth investment model in 50 Macy's stores, a mix of size and geography, with upgrades including facilities, fixtures, assortment and customer service. These stores outperformed the fleet for sales growth in fiscal 2018 and achieved higher customer retention and brand attachment scores.

Looking Ahead

2019 Strategic Initiatives to Drive Growth

The company will carry three of its 2018 strategic initiatives forward and add two new areas of focus in 2019: 

•Growth150: Expand growth investment strategy to another 100 stores. 

•Backstage: Add Backstage locations to 45 Macy’s stores and deliver positive comparable sales for the Backstage stores previously opened.

3

•Vendor Direct: Build on the success of the 2018 launch with continued aggressive expansion of vendors and SKUs.

•Mobile: Continue ‘mobile first’ strategy. Strategically enhance the Macy’s mobile app with new features and functions to deliver outsized growth in mobile sales.

•Destination Businesses: Invest in areas where the company already has strong market share to drive disproportionate growth. These categories are dresses, fine jewelry, big ticket, men’s tailored, women's shoes and beauty.

The company also intends to focus on innovation both through technology and new economic models. The company will double the number of Market @ Macy’s locations, all of which will be powered by the b8ta platform. The company will also continue to expand its virtual reality furniture experience in 2019.

Funding Our Future

As part of the North Star strategy, Macy’s, Inc. is committed to increased productivity to fund investment in the business. The company has launched a comprehensive, multi-year program focused on growing its profitability rate by improving productivity across the enterprise. The program includes initiatives to improve margin through enhanced inventory planning and operations, supply chain efficiencies, pricing optimization, improved private brand sourcing and customer acquisition and retention strategies. 

As an initial step in this productivity plan, the company has announced a restructuring that reduces the complexity of the upper management structure to increase the speed of decision making, reduce costs and respond to changing customer expectations. Importantly, it also allows the company to put additional resources behind three focus areas:

•Improving supply chain efficiency; 

•Innovating and enhancing inventory management; and

•Building a larger and healthier customer base.

In addition to the expected 2019 savings, the company anticipates that these activities will fuel the productivity plan over the next 3-5 years and contribute significantly to profitable growth. 

The areas for cost reduction in 2019 have been identified and are reflected in guidance. Beginning in 2019, the company expects the restructuring actions announced today to generate annual expense savings of $100 million. For fiscal 2018, the company recorded one-time charges of approximately $80 million pre-tax for restructuring activities.

Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis and changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis adjusted for the 53rd week calendar shift, which includes adjusting for growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties, assists in evaluating the company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure which the company believes provides meaningful information about its operational efficiency by excluding the impact of changes in tax law and structure, debt levels and capital investment. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items from EBITDA, net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders that are not associated with the company’s core operations and that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude period-to-period provides useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the company's ability to generate earnings and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods. 

The reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis) is in the same manner as illustrated below, except that the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties is the only reconciling item. In addition, the company does not provide the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure of diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders excluding certain items because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate. 

Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Changes in Comparable Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

(1)Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales, excluding commissions from departments licensed to third parties. Stores impacted by a natural disaster or undergoing significant expansion or shrinkage remain in the comparable sales calculation unless the store, or material portion of the store, is closed for a significant period of time. Definitions and calculations of comparable sales differ among companies in the retail industry.

(2)Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales in the calculation of comparable sales. The company licenses third parties to operate certain departments in its stores and online and receives commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net sales. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The company does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its comparable sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e., on an owned basis). The amounts of commissions earned on sales of departments licensed to third parties are not material to its net sales for the periods presented.

(3)Represents comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis that incorporates a shift of the company's fiscal 2017 calendar to align with fiscal 2018 on a like-for-like basis as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017.
