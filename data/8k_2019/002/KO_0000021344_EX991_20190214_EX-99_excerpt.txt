Company Provides 2019 Financial Outlook

ATLANTA, Feb. 14, 2019 – The Coca-Cola Company today reported another quarter of solid operating performance, capping off strong financial results for the year. While reported net revenues declined due to refranchising and currency headwinds, the company delivered organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth within its long-term target for the sixth consecutive quarter, while also gaining value share globally.

"I am pleased with our strong organic revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Our results demonstrate progress in our transformation as a consumer-centric, total beverage company and the power of a more strategically aligned system," said James Quincey, CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. "Coca-Cola has established a strong foundation to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities and drive sustained shareowner value."

Highlights

Quarterly / Full Year Performance

•Revenues: Net revenues declined 6% to $7.1 billion for the quarter and declined 10% to $31.9 billion for the year. Fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by headwinds of 13% and 17%, respectively, from the combined impact of currency and the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 5% for the quarter, driven by concentrate sales growth of 1% and price/mix growth of 4%. The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in an approximate 1-point benefit to organic revenue (non-GAAP)

growth. For the year, organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 5% driven by concentrate sales growth of 3% and price/mix growth of 2%. 

•Margin: Operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, expanded 516 and 585 basis points for the quarter and full year, respectively. Comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expanded 13 and 385 basis points for the quarter and full year, respectively. Margin expansion was driven by divestitures of lower-margin bottling operations and the company's ongoing productivity efforts. These drivers were partially offset by the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard and currency, which resulted in an approximate 220 and 160 basis-point headwind for the quarter and full year, respectively.

•Market share: The company continued to gain value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages for the quarter and full year.

•Cash flow: Cash from operations for the full year was $7.3 billion, up 6% from the prior year. Full year free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $6.0 billion, up 14% from the prior year.

•Share repurchases: Full year purchases of stock for treasury were $1.9 billion. Full year net share repurchases (non-GAAP) totaled $442 million.

Company Updates

•Key leadership appointments and fostering a growth culture: In the fourth quarter, the company announced several changes in top leadership, including the election of a new president and chief operating officer, in addition to succession plans for the chief financial officer and the chairman of the board. Within the broader organization, the company made solid progress during the year in renewing its culture by implementing changes to its compensation philosophy – placing a sharper focus on performance and the potential to drive long-term growth. The company also continued to act with more speed and agility, enabled by a new operating model that has given field operations greater decision-making authority and autonomy.

•Tailoring the sparkling portfolio to today's consumer: The company continued to strengthen its sparkling soft drinks portfolio and build consumption rituals through world-class innovation, premiumization and revenue growth management initiatives. In North America, innovation in the iconic Diet Coke brand, along with the continued success of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, led to an 8-point acceleration in retail value growth for the no-calorie sparkling soft drinks portfolio for the year. The company's strong performance in low- and no-calorie sparkling soft drinks demonstrates the success of its initiatives to help consumers reduce added sugar. Globally, premium innovations, such as Coke Plus Coffee, and revenue growth management initiatives helped drive transactions ahead of 2% volume growth in the sparkling soft drinks portfolio during 2018.

•Growing the total portfolio: The company’s increased speed and agility, coupled with the strength of its distribution system, helped launch approximately 500 products across multiple markets through the lift, shift and scale strategy while also accelerating the elimination of underperforming SKUs during the year. The company also announced several key acquisitions in 2018, including Costa Limited, which provides a platform to build a global coffee business, and a strategic partnership with BODYARMOR, one of the fastest-growing beverage trademarks in the United States.

•Working toward a World Without Waste: In early 2018, the company introduced its World Without Waste initiative, which includes a goal to collect and recycle one bottle or can for each one the company sells by 2030. The company’s progress during the year included establishing or joining 10 global partnerships; announcing four technology advancements, including the opening of PlantBottle technology for use across the industry; and launching water in 100% recycled plastic bottles in four markets.

In addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following:

Consolidated

•Price/mix growth of 2% for the year was largely driven by solid price and package execution in the marketplace within Latin America and Europe, Middle East & Africa. For the full year, concentrate sales grew ahead of unit case volume, primarily from the dissolution of Beverage Partners Worldwide and the company’s subsequent launch of Fuze Tea across major European markets. Price/mix growth of 4% for the quarter was due to price/mix of 3% in the core business and a 1-point benefit of segment mix from Bottling Investments. Concentrate sales grew 1 point ahead of unit case volume in the quarter, largely due to one additional day. 

•Full year unit case volume growth of 2% was led by 3% growth in developing and emerging markets along with slight growth in developed markets. For the quarter, unit case volume growth was even, as solid growth across Central and Eastern Europe as well as India was offset by the impact of more challenging economic conditions 

4

in certain emerging markets, such as Argentina and Central America. Volume performance throughout the year was impacted by strategic actions to focus on value over volume, including pricing and packaging decisions in the United States and Western Europe, as well as the deprioritization of low-margin commodity water in China. Category cluster performance was as follows:

◦For the year, sparkling soft drinks grew 2%, driven by strong growth in China and India as well as across Central and Eastern Europe. Full year growth was led by Trademark Coca-Cola through continued double-digit growth of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in addition to strong growth in the low- and no-calorie offerings of Sprite and Fanta. Sparkling soft drinks declined 1% in the quarter as solid volume growth across Central and Eastern Europe as well as India was offset by the impact of more challenging economic conditions in certain emerging markets, including Argentina and Central America. 

◦Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages declined 2% in the quarter and 1% for the year. The declines were largely driven by strategic decisions to deprioritize low-value juice brands in key African and Southeast Asian markets, as well as packaging downsizing actions in the juice portfolio within North America.

◦Water, enhanced water and sports drinks grew 3% for the year, driven by strength in single-serve packaging in China and premium offerings in North America. The category cluster grew 1% in the quarter, led by performance across developing and emerging markets.

◦Tea and coffee grew 3% in the quarter and 1% for the year, largely driven by innovation and new product launches including Georgia Craftsman in Japan and Authentic Tea House in China.

•Operating income grew 21% in the quarter and 14% for the year, which included a benefit from comparability items, partially offset by currency headwinds and structural headwinds related to refranchising. Comparable currency neutral operating income (adjusted for structural items and accounting changes) (non-GAAP) grew 8% in the quarter and 11% for the year, driven by solid organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth and the benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives.

Europe, Middle East & Africa

•Price/mix declined 1% for the quarter, primarily due to negative geographic mix from the timing of shipments across the Middle East and North Africa. 

•Unit case volume was even in the quarter, as continued double-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and strong performance in Fuze Tea was offset by the impact of a challenging macroeconomic environment in certain key African and Middle Eastern markets.

•For the year, the company gained value share in total NARTD beverages as well as the juice, dairy and plant-based beverages category cluster and the tea and coffee cluster. The company maintained value share in the water, enhanced water and sports drinks category cluster.

Latin America

•Price/mix grew 13% for the quarter, largely driven by strong performance in Mexico through revenue growth management initiatives as well as positive price/mix across all business units.

5

•Unit case volume declined 2% in the quarter as growth in Brazil, Colombia and Peru was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Argentina. Mexico volume was even for the quarter, partially due to the impact of strategic revenue growth management initiatives in the market.

•For the year, the company gained value share in total NARTD beverages and in all category clusters with the exception of the tea and coffee cluster.

North America

•Price/mix grew 2% for the quarter, marking another quarter of sequential improvement, as pricing actions across the portfolio offset a more challenging cost environment. 

•Unit case volume declined 1% in the quarter, largely due to the impact of strategic revenue growth management initiatives in the market. For the total portfolio, transaction growth outpaced volume performance reflecting continued focus on value over volume. Sparkling soft drinks volume declined 1% as high single-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and strong performance in Sprite was offset by the impact of pricing actions taken across the total sparkling soft drinks portfolio. Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages volume declined 2% as strong growth in fairlife and Honest juices was offset by the impact of package downsizing across the juice portfolio. Tea volume declined low single digits, impacted by deprioritizing low-margin tea products. 

•Operating income for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by a combined 10-point headwind from cycling the benefit of intercompany profit elimination in the prior year related to refranchising in addition to the impact of accounting changes. Operating income was further impacted by increased freight costs.

•For the year, the company gained value share in total NARTD beverages along with sparkling soft drinks.

Asia Pacific

•Price/mix grew 2% for the quarter as solid pricing across the majority of the group's markets was partially offset by geographic mix due to growth in emerging and developing markets outpacing developed markets.

•Unit case volume grew 2% in the quarter led by strong growth across India and Southeast Asia, partially offset by declines in the Philippines and Australia. China's volume growth was slightly positive in the quarter as strong marketing and innovation within Trademark Coca-Cola and Sprite was partially offset by the impact of the deprioritization of low-margin commodity water.

•For the quarter, operating income grew faster than revenues largely due to concentrate sales outpacing unit case volume, ongoing productivity initiatives and the impact of accounting changes.

•For the year, the company maintained value share in total NARTD beverages and gained value share in sparkling soft drinks in addition to the tea and coffee category cluster.

Bottling Investments

•Price/mix grew 3% in the quarter driven by strong price/mix performance in India.

•The operating loss in the quarter was partially driven by items impacting comparability. Comparable currency neutral operating loss (non-GAAP) was impacted by the refranchising of North American bottling territories and the deconsolidation of bottling operations in Latin America.

Outlook

The 2019 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full year 2019 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported operating income, or full year 2019 projected comparable EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported EPS from continuing operations without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the exact timing and amount of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes; and the exact timing and amount of comparability items throughout 2019. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on full year 2019 GAAP financial results.

Full Year 2019 Revenues:

•Approximately 4% growth in organic revenues (non-GAAP)

•12% to 13% growth in comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP) including an 8% to 9% tailwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural items

•Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP): 3% to 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions

Full Year 2019 Operating Income:

•10% to 11% growth in comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) including a low single-digit tailwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural items

•Comparable operating income (non-GAAP): 6% to 7% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions

Full Year 2019 Other Items:

•Underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP): Estimated to be 19.5%

•Cash from operations: At least $8.0 billion

•Capital expenditures (excluding discontinued operations): Approximately $2.0 billion

•Net share repurchases (non-GAAP): Share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock-based compensation plans

Full Year 2019 EPS:

•Comparable EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP): -1% to 1% growth versus $2.08 in 2018

First Quarter 2019 Considerations:

•Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP): 6% to 7% tailwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural items; 6% to 7% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions

•Comparable operating income (non-GAAP): 0% impact from structural items, which does not include the impact from acquisitions and divestitures; 10% to 11% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions

•One less day compared to first quarter 2018

Notes

•All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period.

•All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales, unless otherwise noted. "Unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 24 eight-ounce servings of finished beverage. "Unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers.

•"Core business" represents the combined performance from the Europe, Middle East & Africa; Latin America; North America; and Asia Pacific operating segments and Corporate offset by intersegment eliminations.

•"Concentrate sales" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, "concentrate sales" represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments (expressed in equivalent unit cases) after considering the impact of structural changes. For the Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.

•"Price/mix" represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.

•First quarter 2018 financial results were impacted by one less day, and fourth quarter 2018 financial results were impacted by one additional day as compared to the same periods in 2017. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(UNAUDITED)

The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred to herein as "reported"). To supplement our consolidated financial statements reported on a GAAP basis, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures: "comparable net revenues", "comparable currency neutral net revenues", "organic revenues", "core business organic revenues", "comparable operating margin", "comparable operating income", "comparable currency neutral operating income", "comparable currency neutral operating income (adjusted for structural items and accounting changes)", "comparable EPS from continuing operations", "comparable currency neutral EPS from continuing operations", "underlying effective tax rate", "free cash flow" and "net share repurchases", each of which are defined below. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are also included. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and company management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance.

DEFINITIONS

•"Accounting changes" refer to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"), which was adopted by the company effective January 1, 2018.

•"Currency neutral operating results" are determined by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results, by the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as appropriate, the derived current period local currency operating results by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to translate the company's financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not changed from the comparable prior year period.

•"Structural changes" generally refer to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling and distribution operations. In 2018, the company refranchised our Canadian and Latin American bottling operations. The impact of these refranchising activities has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our North America, Latin America and Bottling Investments operating segments. In 2018, the company acquired a controlling interest in the Philippine bottling operations, which was previously accounted for as an equity method investee. The impact of this acquisition has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. In 2018, the company also acquired a controlling interest in the Oman bottler. The impact of this acquisition has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments operating segment. In 2017, the company refranchised bottling territories in North America to certain of its unconsolidated bottling partners. Additionally, in conjunction with the refranchising of Coca-Cola Refreshment's ("CCR") Southwest operating unit ("Southwest Transaction") on April 1, 2017, we obtained an equity interest in AC Bebidas, S. de R.L. de C.V. ("AC Bebidas"), a subsidiary of Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Arca"), which impacted our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. The impact of these transactions has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the applicable operating segments. In 2017, the company also refranchised its bottling operations in China to the two local franchise bottlers. The impact of these refranchising activities has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. These transactions were also included as structural items in our analysis of comparable currency neutral operating income (adjusted for structural items and accounting changes) (non-GAAP) on a consolidated basis. In addition, for non-company-owned and licensed brands sold in the refranchised territories in North America for which the company no longer reports unit case volume, we have eliminated the unit case volume from the base year when calculating 2018 versus 2017

•"Comparable operating margin" and "comparable operating income" are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). "Comparable currency neutral operating income" and "comparable currency neutral operating income (adjusted for structural items and accounting changes)" are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below) and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Comparable currency neutral operating income (adjusted for structural items and accounting changes) (non-GAAP) has also been adjusted for structural changes and accounting changes. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion, comparable operating income (non-GAAP) growth, comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) growth and comparable currency neutral operating income (adjusted for structural items and accounting changes) (non-GAAP) growth measures enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results.

•"Comparable EPS from continuing operations" and "comparable currency neutral EPS from continuing operations" are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Comparable currency neutral EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP) has also been adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP) and comparable currency neutral EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP) growth measures enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results.

•"Underlying effective tax rate" is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the estimated annual effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes, which excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below).

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(UNAUDITED)

•"Free cash flow" is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions.

•"Net share repurchases" is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects the net amount of purchases of stock for treasury after considering proceeds from the issuances of stock, the net change in stock issuance receivables (related to employee stock options exercised but not settled prior to the end of the period) and the net change in treasury stock payables (for treasury shares repurchased but not settled prior to the end of the period).

ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY

The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as "items impacting comparability" based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions; and evaluates the company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as pertaining to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered "items impacting comparability." Items impacting comparability include, but are not limited to, asset impairments, charges related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives, and transaction gains/losses, in each case when exceeding a U.S. dollar threshold. Also included are our proportionate share of similar items incurred by our equity method investees, timing differences related to our economic (nondesignated) hedging activities and unrealized mark-to-market adjustments of equity securities and trading debt securities, regardless of size. In addition, we provide the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency neutral operating results" defined above).

Asset Impairments

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the company recorded charges of $450 million related to the impairment of CCR assets primarily as a result of management's view of the proceeds that were expected to be received for the remaining bottling territories upon their refranchising. These charges were determined by comparing the fair values of the assets to their carrying values. 

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, the company recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of $334 million and $591 million, respectively. The charges of $334 million were related to certain equity method investees in the Middle East. These impairments were primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results largely related to instability in the region, which include recent sanctions imposed locally. A charge of $205 million was related to an equity method investee in Indonesia.

The 2019 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full year 2019 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported operating income, or full year 2019 projected comparable EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported EPS from continuing operations without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the exact timing and amount of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes; and the exact timing and amount of comparability items throughout 2019.
