As previously disclosed, on April 21, 2018, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (“CenterPoint Energy”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among CenterPoint Energy, Vectren Corporation, an Indiana corporation (“Vectren”), and Pacer Merger Sub, Inc., an Indiana corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Vectren (the “Merger”), with Vectren continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy.

Consummation of the Merger is contingent on the satisfaction of various conditions, including receipt of a final order in an informational proceeding before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (“PUCO”). CenterPoint Energy received the final order from PUCO on January 30, 2019. The Merger is expected to close within three business days of receipt of the final order.

The foregoing list of factors is not all-inclusive because it is not possible to predict all factors. Furthermore, it may not be possible to assess the impact of any such factor on CenterPoint Energy’s or Vectren’s respective businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Additional risks and uncertainties will be discussed in other materials that CenterPoint Energy and Vectren will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with the proposed transactions. Other risk factors are detailed from time to time in CenterPoint Energy’s and Vectren’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, but any specific factors that may be provided should not be construed as exhaustive. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement. While CenterPoint Energy believes these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, CenterPoint Energy undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
