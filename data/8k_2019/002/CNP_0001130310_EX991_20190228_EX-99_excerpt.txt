For Immediate Release  

CenterPoint Energy reports full-year 2018 earnings of $0.74 per diluted  

share; $1.60 earnings per diluted share on a guidance basis, excluding  

impacts associated with the merger  

Houston – Feb. 28, 2019 - CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported full-year income available to common shareholders of $333 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared with $1,792 million, or $4.13 per diluted share in 2017.  

On a guidance basis, full-year 2018 earnings were $1.60 per diluted share, excluding impacts associated with the Vectren merger (the merger). Full-year 2017 earnings, on a guidance basis, were $1.37 per diluted share, excluding a one-time tax benefit of $1,113 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) federal income tax rate reduction.  

Fourth quarter 2018 earnings were $0.18 per diluted share, compared to $2.99 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017. On a guidance basis, fourth quarter 2018 earnings were $0.36 per diluted share, excluding impacts associated with the merger. Excluding the TCJA tax benefit, on a guidance basis, fourth quarter 2017 earnings were $0.33 per diluted share.  

“I am very pleased with our 2018 results as they represent another solid year of meeting the financial goals we set,” said Scott M. Prochazka, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. “Our recently completed merger expands our utility businesses to eight states, provides opportunities to leverage and expand our competitive energy businesses across a larger U.S. footprint, and gives us greater confidence in putting forward long-term financial targets.”  

Business Segments  

Electric Transmission & Distribution  

The electric transmission & distribution segment reported full-year 2018 operating income of $623 million, consisting of $568 million from the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU) and $55 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for 2017 was $636 million, consisting of $561 million from the TDU and $75 million related to securitization bonds.  

Operating income for the TDU benefited primarily from rate relief, customer growth and higher equity return related to the annual true-up of transition charges. These benefits were partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses, lower revenues reflecting the lower federal corporate income tax rate due to the TCJA, and higher depreciation and amortization expense.

1   

The retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for compensation-retirement benefits (ASU 2017-07) resulted in an increase to TDU operating income and a corresponding decrease to other income of $26 million for 2017.  

Natural Gas Distribution  

The natural gas distribution segment reported full-year 2018 operating income of $266 million, compared with $348 million in 2017.  

Full-year 2018 operating income for natural gas distribution improved primarily as a result of rate relief and customer growth. These increases were more than offset by lower revenues reflecting the lower federal corporate income tax rate due to the TCJA, higher operation and maintenance expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expense.  

The retrospective adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in an increase to natural gas distribution operating income and a corresponding decrease to other income of $20 million for 2017.  

Energy Services  

The energy services segment reported a full-year operating loss of $47 million, which included a mark-to-market loss of $110 million, compared with operating income of $126 million for 2017, which included a mark-to-market gain of $79 million. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments, operating income was $63 million in 2018 compared to $47 million in 2017. Operating income increased primarily due to improved margin and volumes. This increase was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses primarily associated with growth.  

Midstream Investments  

The midstream investments segment reported full-year 2018 equity income of $307 million, compared with $265 million in 2017.  

Other Operations  

The other operations segment reported an operating loss of $11 million for full-year 2018, compared with operating income of $26 million in 2017. This decrease is primarily due to merger-related costs.  

Earnings Outlook  

   •    

2018 - 2023 target of 5 - 7% compound annual guidance basis EPS growth, using $1.60 as the starting EPS  

   •    

2019 guidance basis EPS range of $1.60 - $1.70, excluding certain impacts associated with the merger:  

   •    

Integration and transaction-related fees and expenses, including severance and other costs to achieve anticipated cost savings as a result of the merger  

-more-  

2   

   •    

Merger financing impacts in January, prior to the completion of the merger, due to the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund the merger that resulted in higher net interest expense and higher common stock share count  

   •    

2020 guidance basis EPS range of $1.75 - $1.90  

Both the 2019 and 2020 guidance ranges consider operations performance to date and assumptions for certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as customer growth (approximately 2% for electric operations and 1% for natural gas distribution) and usage including normal weather, throughput, commodity prices, recovery of capital invested through rate cases and other rate filings, effective tax rates, financing activities and related interest rates, and regulatory and judicial proceedings as well as the volume of work contracted in our infrastructure services business. The ranges also consider anticipated cost savings as a result of the merger and the estimated cost and timing of technology integration projects. The 2019 guidance range assumes Enable Midstream Partners, LP’s (Enable) 2019 guidance range for net income attributable to common units of $435 - $505 million, provided on Enable’s 4th quarter earnings call on February 19, 2019. The 2020 guidance range utilizes a range of CenterPoint Energy scenarios for Enable’s 2020 net income attributable to common units.  

In providing this guidance, CenterPoint Energy uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not consider other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, including those from Enable, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and the related stocks, or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company’s Energy Services business, which, along with the certain excluded impacts associated with the merger, could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the applicable guidance period. CenterPoint Energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking adjusted diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of ZENS and related securities and mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company’s Energy Services business are not estimable as they are highly variable and difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management’s control.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by CenterPoint Energy in Providing Guidance  

In addition to presenting its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including presentation of income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share, CenterPoint Energy also provides guidance based on adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. CenterPoint Energy’s adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation excludes from income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share, respectively, the impact of ZENS and related securities and mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company’s Energy Services business. CenterPoint Energy’s guidance for 2019 also does not

 reflect certain impacts associated with the Vectren merger, which are integration and transaction-related fees and expenses, including severance and other costs to achieve anticipated cost savings as a result of the merger and merger financing impacts in January, prior to the completion of the merger due to the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund the merger that resulted in higher net interest expense and higher common stock share count. CenterPoint Energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of ZENS and related securities and mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company’s Energy Services business are not estimable as they are highly variable and difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management’s control. These excluded items, along with the excluded impacts associated with the merger, could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the applicable guidance period.  

Management evaluates the company’s financial performance in part based on adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of CenterPoint Energy’s overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods. The adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that Management believes does not most accurately reflect the company’s fundamental business performance. These excluded items are reflected in the reconciliation tables of this news release, where applicable. CenterPoint Energy’s adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share, which respectively are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures also may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
