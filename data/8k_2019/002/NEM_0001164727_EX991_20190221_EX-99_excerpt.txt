Exhibit 99.1  

 Newmont Reports 2018 Reserves and Resources; Delivered 6.7Mozs of Reserves through exploration, Resources increase  

 DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 21, 2019--Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) (Newmont or the Company) reported gold Reserves of 65.4 million attributable ounces for 2018 compared to 68.5 million ounces at the end of 2017. New additions of 6.7 million ounces exceeded the Company’s target, but were offset by negative revisions of 3.6 million ounces and depletion of 6.1 million ounces. Gold Resources1 increased significantly to 55.0 million ounces in 2018 compared to 48.2 million ounces in 2017 at a constant gold price.  

 The Company outperformed its exploration target, adding 6.7 million ounces of gold Reserves by the drill bit, demonstrating the success of Newmont’s exploration program. Revisions of 3.6 million ounces were largely driven by model changes at Phoenix and cost and pit design changes at Carlin. Newmont reported 5.1 million ounces of attributable mine production in 2018 resulting in 6.1 million contained ounces of reserve depletion.  

 Notable reserve additions for the year include a first-time declaration of 2.2 million equity ounces from the Yanacocha Sulfides project, 0.8 million ounces each at Tanami and Cripple Creek & Victor (CC&V), 0.6 million ounces at Ahafo Open Pits, 0.5 million ounces at Carlin Underground and 0.4 million equity ounces at Turquoise Ridge.  

 The Company’s average gold Reserve grade increased four percent to 1.19 grams per tonne compared to 1.14 grams per tonne in the prior year, largely due to higher grade additions at Yanacocha Sulfides, Tanami, and Carlin Underground.  

 Newmont’s gold Resources increased significantly to 55.0 million ounces, up 14 percent from 48.2 million ounces in 2017 at a constant gold price, and more than offsetting the conversion of Resource ounces to Reserves. Positive changes to the Company’s resource base included 9.5 million ounces added through exploration and studies and 5.3 million ounces through the acquisition of a 50 percent interest in the Galore Creek project. These additions were offset by the conversion of 7.7 million ounces to Reserves, along with net negative revisions of 2.2 million ounces primarily driven by Phoenix.  

 Notable resource additions include 1.8 million equity ounces at KCGM, 1.6 million ounces at Tanami, 1.0 million equity ounces at Yanacocha, 0.8 million equity ounces at Merian, 0.8 million ounces each at Boddington and CC&V and 0.5 million ounces at Ahafo Open Pits.  

 Newmont’s gold Resource grade decreased to 0.76 grams per tonne compared to 0.92 grams per tonne in the prior year, largely due to the acquisition of Galore Creek and lower grade additions from Boddington.  

 The Company reported attributable Measured and Indicated2 gold resources of 39.4 million ounces, up 15 percent from the prior year, and 15.6 million ounces of attributable Inferred gold resources, an increase of 12 percent from the prior year.  

 Copper  

 The Company increased copper Reserves by seven percent to 1.3 million tonnes and copper Resources3 increased significantly to 4.7 million tonnes, as compared to 2.3 million tonnes at the end of 2017. The increase was largely driven by the Galore Creek acquisition of 2.8 million tonnes.  

 Exploration Outlook  

 Newmont’s total attributable exploration expenditure4 is expected to increase to approximately $250 million in 2019, up nine percent from the prior year as the Company continues to focus on growing reserves and resources over the longer term. Around 75 percent of total exploration spend will be dedicated to near-mine expansion programs and the remaining 25 percent will be allocated to the advancement of greenfield projects and innovation programs. Geographically, the Company expects to invest approximately 35 percent in North America, 20 percent in Australia and the remainder in South America, Africa and other locations.  

 Gold Reserve Sensitivity  

 A $100 increase in gold price would result in an approximate seven percent increase in gold reserves while a $100 decrease in gold price would result in an approximate 13 percent decrease in gold reserves. These sensitivities assume an oil price of $65 per barrel (WTI) and an Australian dollar exchange rate of $0.75.

 Key Assumptions:

 Reserve and Resource Tables  

 Proven and Probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determine economic feasibility. Metal price assumptions follow SEC guidance not to exceed a three year trailing average. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables included in this release list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the assumed processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of material considered economic to process, varies with material type, price, metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and co- or by-product credits. The Proven and Probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold and silver or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold or copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.  

 The Measured, Indicated, and Inferred resource figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation and are exclusive of reserves. A “Mineral Resource” is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade, or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories. Ounces of gold and silver or pounds of copper included in the Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Market fluctuations in the price of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could change future estimates of resources. Please refer to the reserves and resources cautionary statement at the end of the release.  

 We publish reserves and resources annually, and will recalculate reserves and resources at year-end 2019, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, mine designs, model changes, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2019.

 Cautionary Statement regarding Reserves and Resources:  

 The “reserves” disclosed in this release have been prepared in compliance with Industry Guide 7 published by the SEC. As used in this news release, the term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “economically,” as used in this definition, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term “legally,” as used in this definition, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans. Reserves in this news release are aggregated from the proven and probable classes.  

 The term “proven reserves” used in the tables of this news release means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less closely spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Newmont classifies all reserves as Probable on its development projects until a year of production has confirmed all assumptions made in the reserve estimates. Proven and probable reserves include gold, copper or silver attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest. Proven and probable reserves were calculated using cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper or silver extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.  

 Notice for U.S. Investors:  

 The terms “resources” and “Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources” are used in this news release. Investors are advised that the SEC does not recognize these terms and “resources” have not been prepared in accordance with Industry Guide 7. Newmont has determined that such “resources” would be substantively the same as those prepared using the Guidelines established by the Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration (SME) and defined as “Mineral Resource”. Estimates of resources are subject to further exploration and development, are subject to additional risks, and no assurance can be given that they will eventually convert to future reserves. Inferred Resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the Inferred Resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. Also, disclosure of contained ounces is permitted under the SME Guideline and other regulatory guidelines, such as Canada’s NI 43-101 and Australia’s JORC. However, the SEC generally requires mineral resource information in SEC-filed documents to be reported only as in-place tonnage and grade. Investors are reminded that even if significant mineralization is discovered and converted to reserves, during the time necessary to ultimately move such mineralization to production the economic feasibility of production may change. See the Company’s Annual Report for the “Proven and Probable Reserve” and “Mineralized Material” tables prepared in compliance with the SEC’s Industry Guide 7, available at www.newmont.com and on www.sec.gov. Investors are reminded that the tables presented in the Annual Report are estimates as of December 31, 2018 and were presented on an attributable basis reflecting the Company’s ownership interest at such time.
