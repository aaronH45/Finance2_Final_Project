The proceeds of the Term Loan Agreement were used to fully refinance the Company’s existing term loan agreement, dated as of February 28, 2018 (as amended, modified, extended, restated, replaced, or supplemented prior to the date hereof, the “Existing Term Loan Agreement”), among the Company, the banks party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and to pay fees and expenses related thereto. The Term Loan Agreement is unsecured. 

The interest rate applicable to the borrowing under the Term Loan Agreement ranges from a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.75% to 1.25% or a base rate plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.25%, depending on the rating of certain index debt of the Company (compared to the interest rate applicable to any borrowings under the Existing Term Loan Agreement which ranged from LIBOR plus a margin of 0.875% to 1.500% or a base rate plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.50%, depending on the rating of certain index debt of the Company). Under the Term Loan Agreement, the Company must repay the unpaid principal amount of the loans quarterly commencing on March 29, 2019 in an amount equal to 1.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans made on the effective date of the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement will mature on February 8, 2023. 

The Term Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties for investment grade financings.
