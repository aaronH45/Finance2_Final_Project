Verizon announces amendments to its previously announced private exchange offers for 19 series of notes  

NEW YORK – Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) (NYSE, NASDAQ: VZ) today announced that it has amended several terms of its previously announced offers to exchange 19 outstanding series of debt securities (the “Old Notes”) described in the Offering Memorandum dated February 8, 2019 (the “Offering Memorandum” and, together with the accompanying letter of transmittal and eligibility letter, the “Exchange Offer Documents”) for newly issued debt securities of Verizon (the “New Notes”) (the “Exchange Offers”). Verizon amended the Exchange Offers as follows:  

   •    

increased the spread used to determine the interest rate per annum that the New Notes will bear from 130 basis points over the yield of the 2.625% U.S. Treasury Security due February 15, 2029 (the “Reference Security”) to 137 basis points over the yield of the Reference Security;  

   •    

extended the (i) Early Participation Date and Withdrawal Date to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on February 25, 2019 (originally February 22, 2019), (ii) Price Determination Date to 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on February 26, 2019 (originally February 25, 2019), (iii) Early Settlement Date to February 28, 2019 (originally February 27, 2019), (iv) Expiration Date to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on March 11, 2019 (originally March 8, 2019) and (v) Final Settlement Date to March 13, 2019 (originally March 12, 2019); and  

   •    

provided that with respect to each Exchange Offer, Verizon will not be obligated to (i) accept for exchange any validly tendered Old Notes of such series or (ii) issue any New Notes, pay any cash amounts or complete such Exchange Offer, unless in Verizon’s reasonable judgment, it is highly likely that the exchange of such Old Notes for New Notes should qualify as a “significant modification” of such Old Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as determined on the relevant Early Participation Date or Expiration Date, as applicable (the “Exchange Tax Condition”), which condition may not be waived.   

Based on the information currently available to Verizon, there is a high likelihood that Verizon’s 6.400% notes due 2033 and a possibility that Verizon’s 7.750% notes due 2030 would not satisfy the Exchange Tax Condition for New Notes issued on the Early Settlement Date.  

Except as set forth herein, all other terms and conditions of the Exchange Offers described in the Exchange Offer Documents remain unchanged, including the Early Participation Payment (as defined in Verizon’s press release announcing the Exchange Offers, dated February 8, 2019).  

In addition, Verizon today announced that, following the Early Participation Date, it intends, but is under no obligation, to issue a notice to redeem, in whole or in part, the following series of Old Notes at the applicable redemption price for each such series:
