ITEM 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On February 20, 2019, Apartment Investment and Management Company (“Aimco”) effected the previously-announced 1-for-1.03119 reverse split of its outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, on February 20, 2019, Aimco’s wholly owned subsidiary, AIMCO-GP, Inc. (the “General Partner”), which is the general partner of Aimco’s operating partnership, AIMCO Properties, L.P. (the “Aimco Operating Partnership”), entered into the Eleventh Amendment (the “Eleventh Amendment”) to the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AIMCO Properties, L.P., dated as of July 29, 1994 and amended and restated as of February 28, 2007 (the “Operating Partnership Agreement”). The Eleventh Amendment modifies the definition of “Adjustment Factor” in the Operating Partnership Agreement so that no change occurs if Aimco splits or subdivides its outstanding shares of common stock, or combines its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, if the Aimco Operating Partnership concurrently effects a similar split, subdivision or combination of its outstanding Partnership Common Units (“OP Units”). On February 20, 2019, the General Partner effected a 1-for-1.03119 reverse split of its outstanding OP Units. As a result of this reverse unit split, and the Eleventh Amendment, after the Reverse Stock Split, OP Units will continue to be redeemable in exchange for shares of Aimco common stock on a one-for-one basis (or cash equal to the value of such shares, as determined by the Aimco Operating Partnership in its discretion). 

The description of the Eleventh Amendment set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Eleventh Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 5.03.Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

Aimco has filed Articles of Amendment (the “Articles of Amendment”) to amend its charter to effect the Reverse Stock Split, effective at 5:00 pm, Eastern Time, on February 20, 2019. Pursuant to the Articles of Amendment, every 1.03119 shares of Aimco’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in the Reverse Stock Split, and cash will be paid in lieu of any fraction of a share to which a stockholder would otherwise be entitled.

The description of the Articles of Amendment set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Articles of Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 9.01.Financial Statements and Exhibits.
