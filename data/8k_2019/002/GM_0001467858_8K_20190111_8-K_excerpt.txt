ITEM 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On January 11, 2019 General Motors Company ("GM") announced that it expects 2018 earnings per share-diluted-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow to exceed the guidance provided in connection with its third quarter 2018 earnings release on October 31, 2018.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures: See GM’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a description of earnings per share-diluted-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow, which are non-GAAP measures, along with a description of various uses for such measures. GM’s calculation of these non-GAAP measures are set forth within these reports and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures.

Cautionary Note on Forward Looking Statements. This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Statements including words such as “anticipate,” “appears,” “approximately,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “designed,” “effect,” “estimate,” “evaluate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “initiative,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “priorities,” “project,” “pursue,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “when,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements represent GM’s current judgment about possible future events. In making these statements we rely upon assumptions and analysis based on GM’s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of future performance; they involve risks and uncertainties and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, a variety of economic, competitive and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond GM’s control and are described in GM’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as additional factors it may describe from time to time in other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors that affect the subject of these statements, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.
