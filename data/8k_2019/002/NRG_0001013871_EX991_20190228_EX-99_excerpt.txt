Retail 

Full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $952 million, $127 million higher than 2017, driven by our margin enhancement and cost reduction initiatives, increased usage and growth related to M&A activity, and higher gross margins from increased demand response MWs sold, partially offset by higher supply costs and higher operating expenses related to margin enhancements.

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $197 million, $13 million lower than the fourth quarter 2017, driven by higher margin enhancement costs, higher bad debt and higher supply costs, offset by higher gross margins from our margin enhancement initiatives, growth related to M&A activity, and cost savings.

Generation 

Full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $856 million, $211 million higher than 2017, driven by:

•Texas: $179 million increase on higher realized energy prices, partially offset by higher outage costs [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $84 million, $44 million lower than the fourth quarter 2017, driven by:

•Texas: $17 million decrease primarily due to higher operating expenses related to the fall outage at the South Texas Project (STP)[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Corporate 

Full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $(31) million, $50 million better than 2017, driven by lower expenses associated with the Transformation Plan, partially offset by the reduction in shared services revenue from GenOn.

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $(8) million, $33 million better than the fourth quarter 2017, driven by lower expenses associated with the Transformation Plan.

NRG Strategic Developments 

Transformation Plan

NRG realized $532 million of its 2018 cost savings target and $32 million in margin enhancement, as part of the Transformation Plan. With respect to the asset sales, on February 4, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its South Central Portfolio to Cleco, for approximately $1.0 billion3 and on February 27, 2019, completed the sale of Carlsbad to Global Infrastructure Partners III (GIP) for $387 million3. NRG's total asset sale proceeds to date are approximately $3.0 billion3. 

Agua Caliente Offer

On November 1, 2018, the Company, which indirectly owns a 35% interest in Agua Caliente, a 290 MW utility-scale solar project, offered to Clearway Energy, Inc. (formerly known as NRG Yield, Inc.) its ownership interest in Agua Caliente Borrower 1, LLC, for approximately $120 million. The offer expired on January 31, 2019, with no action taken by Clearway Energy, Inc.

Capital Allocation Update

During the fourth quarter of 2018, NRG completed $250 million of the additional $500 million share repurchase program announced on the third quarter 2018 earnings call and completed the remaining $250 million of share repurchases in January and February 2019. In total, since March 2018, NRG has repurchased $1.5 billion of shares for an average price of $36.24/share. In addition, the Board of Directors of the Company has authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program to be executed in 2019.

As previously announced, the Company has completed its targeted $640 million of debt reduction through the redemption of $485 million of its outstanding 6.250% senior notes due 2022 and the prepayment of $155 million of Term Loans, and achieved its target net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.0x for 2018.

NRG is revising its balance sheet target ratios in order to further strengthen its balance sheet. Although the Company is not targeting a specific credit rating improvement at this time, the Company will seek to maintain the following credit metrics, consistent with investment grade ratings:

•Net Debt/EBITDA: 2.5x - 2.75x

•Adjusted Cash from Operations / Net Debt: 27.5% - 32.5%

•Interest Coverage: 5.5x - 6.5x

In order to achieve the revised balance sheet targets, the Company is reserving up to $600 million in 2019 capital which may be allocated toward additional debt reduction.

On January 23, 2019, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.03 per share, paid February 15, 2019 to stockholders of record as of February 1, 2019, representing $0.12 per share on an annualized basis.

The following table summarizes the calculation of Free Cash Flow before Growth providing reconciliation to Cash from Operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that NRG’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

EBITDA represents net income before interest (including loss on debt extinguishment), taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented because NRG considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes debt-holders frequently use EBITDA to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

•EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments;

•EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;

•EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments;

•Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

•Other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA differently than NRG does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of NRG’s business. NRG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. See the statements of cash flow included in the financial statements that are a part of this news release.

Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of operating performance. As NRG defines it, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding impairment losses, gains or losses on sales, dispositions or retirements of assets, any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, adjustments to exclude the Adjusted EBITDA related to the non-controlling interest, gains or losses on the repurchase, modification or extinguishment of debt, the impact of restructuring and any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items plus adjustments to reflect the Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons NRG considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted 

23

EBITDA, the reader should be aware that in the future NRG may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release.

Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of NRG's financial statements in evaluating its operating performance because it provides an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods and adjusts for items that we do not consider indicative of NRG’s future operating performance. This measure is widely used by debt-holders to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity and by equity investors to measure our operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations, and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with NRG's Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts and investors concerning its financial performance.

Adjusted cash flow from operating activities is a non-GAAP measure NRG provides to show cash from operations with the reclassification of net payments of derivative contracts acquired in business combinations from financing to operating cash flow, as well as the add back of merger, integration and related restructuring costs. The Company provides the reader with this alternative view of operating cash flow because the cash settlement of these derivative contracts materially impact operating revenues and cost of sales, while GAAP requires NRG to treat them as if there was a financing activity associated with the contracts as of the acquisition dates. The Company adds back merger, integration related restructuring costs as they are one time and unique in nature and do not reflect ongoing cash from operations and they are fully disclosed to investors.

Free cash flow (before Growth) is adjusted cash flow from operations less maintenance and environmental capital expenditures, net of funding, preferred stock dividends and distributions to non-controlling interests and is used by NRG predominantly as a forecasting tool to estimate cash available for debt reduction and other capital allocation alternatives. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons NRG considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. Because we have mandatory debt service requirements (and other non-discretionary expenditures) investors should not rely on free cash flow before Growth as a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.

Free Cash Flow before Growth is utilized by Management in making decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Free Cash Flow before Growth is presented because the Company believes it is a useful tool for assessing the financial performance in the current period. In addition, NRG’s peers evaluate cash available for allocation in a similar manner and accordingly, it is a meaningful indicator for investors to benchmark NRG's performance against its peers. Free Cash Flow before Growth is a performance measure and is not intended to represent net income (loss), cash from operations (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure), or liquidity and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
