SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland — January 23, 2019 — TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE: TEL) today reported results for the fiscal first quarter, which ended December 28, 2018. 

First Quarter Highlights 

· Net sales were $3.35 billion, flat as reported, and up 2 percent organically from the first quarter of 2018 

· Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $1.11, and adjusted EPS were $1.29 

· Cash flow from continuing operating activities was $328 million and free cash flow was $69 million, with $645 million returned to shareholders, including proceeds from the sale of the company’s Subsea Communications business

First Quarter Results 

For the first quarter, the company reported net sales of $3.35 billion, with diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.11, and adjusted EPS were $1.29, in line with the company’s guidance. Cash flow from continuing operating activities was $328 million and free cash flow was $69 million. Total orders were $3.3 billion, below the company’s expectations, and the book-to-bill ratio was 0.99. 

“First quarter results were in line with our guidance and demonstrated resiliency in what turned out to be a slower demand environment than we expected, due primarily to weakness in China markets. Our Industrial and Communications segments showed solid sales growth, while our Transportation segment outperformed a weak global auto production environment through strong content growth,” said Terrence Curtin, Chief Executive Officer of TE Connectivity. “Due to a slower market environment, we are updating our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year, accelerating several levers in our business model to sustain resilience, and investing for long-term growth in alignment with our strategy.”

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We present non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider adjusted financial measures in addition to results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance with GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our company. We believe these measures provide meaningful information to us and investors because they enhance the understanding of our operating performance, ability to generate cash, and the trends of our business. Additionally, we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating our operations. The primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP financial measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. 

The following provides additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures: 

· Organic Net Sales Growth — represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic Net Sales Growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. 

· Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin — represent operating income and operating margin, respectively, (the most comparable GAAP financial measures) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, and other income or charges, if any. We utilize these adjusted measures in combination with operating income and operating margin to assess segment level operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and market conditions. Adjusted Operating Income is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. 

· Adjusted Other Income (Expense), Net — represents net other income (expense) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other items, if any. 

· Adjusted Income Tax Expense and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate — represent income tax expense and effective tax rate, respectively (the most comparable GAAP financial measures) after adjusting for the tax effect of special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any. 

· Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations — represents income from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects. 

· Adjusted Earnings Per Share — represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects. This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.

· Free Cash Flow (FCF) — is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) and Free Cash Flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations. 

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, if any, minus net capital expenditures. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP financial measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters and cash paid (collected) pursuant to collateral requirements related to cross-currency swap contracts, are also excluded by management in evaluating Free Cash Flow. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. These items are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. 

In the calculation of Free Cash Flow, we subtract certain cash items that are ultimately within management’s and the Board of Directors’ discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP financial measure indicates. It should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of Free Cash Flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of Free Cash Flow.
