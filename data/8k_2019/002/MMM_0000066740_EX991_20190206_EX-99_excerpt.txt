ST. PAUL, Minn.—Feb. 6, 2019 — 3M announced today that its Board of Directors will nominate CEO Mike Roman to serve as chairman of the board following the company’s annual meeting of shareholders on May 14, 2019.

“I am proud of 3M, our people, and what we’ve accomplished together,” said Thulin. “I’ve known and worked very closely with Mike, including since his appointment as CEO. I’m very confident that 3M’s best days are ahead and Mike will do a fantastic job leading 3M into the future.” 

“It’s an honor to be nominated to the additional role of chairman of the board,” said Roman. “I thank Inge for his leadership and partnership throughout my career, especially over the past year in his role as executive chairman.”
