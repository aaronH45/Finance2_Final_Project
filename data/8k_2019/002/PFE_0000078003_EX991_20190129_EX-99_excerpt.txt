2019 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE(6) 

Pfizer’s 2019 financial guidance is presented below. Financial guidance reflects a full year of revenue and expense contributions from Consumer Healthcare(3).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Financial guidance for Adjusted diluted EPS(2) reflects anticipated share repurchases totaling approximately $9 billion in 2019. Dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs is currently expected to offset the reduction in shares associated with these share repurchases by approximately half.

Financial guidance for Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions(2) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2) now excludes the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in equity securities. In 2018, Pfizer’s 2018 financial results included net gains on investments in equity securities, which favorably impacted Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions(2) by $586 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2) by approximately $0.08.

A reconciliation of Pfizer’s full-year 2018 financial results to certain components of its 2019 financial guidance, including certain significant factors impacting 2018 financial results and 2019 financial guidance, is below:

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “2018 was highlighted by solid financial performance, shareholder-friendly capital allocation, the strengthening of our pipeline and the formation of our new commercial structure designed to transition the company to a period post-2020 where we expect a higher and more sustained revenue growth profile.

“We enter 2019 with confidence in the competitive positioning of our businesses, the prospects for our recently launched products and product line extensions, as well as the strength and breadth of our research pipeline. Our focus remains on advancing science and innovation in areas that we believe will serve the unmet needs of patients and also create the most attractive opportunities for value creation.

Dr. Bourla continued, “2019 is expected to be a busy year with important clinical data readouts across our early-, mid- and late-stage pipeline. In the near term, we expect to report pivotal top-line results for tanezumab in chronic lower back pain as well as additional data in osteoarthritis following today’s announcement of a second positive Phase 3 trial. Later in the year, we anticipate reporting pivotal results for rivipansel in vaso-occlusive crisis from sickle cell disease as well as the results of the first Phase 3 trials for abrocitinib (PF-04965842), our Janus kinase-1 (JAK1) inhibitor in development for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. In our earlier stage pipeline, we anticipate generating data for two nonalcoholic steatohepatitis candidates (PF-05221304 and PF-06865571), 

- 3 -

psoriasis data for two tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor candidates (PF-06826647 and PF-06700841, a TYK2/JAK1 dual inhibitor) and immune response data for our respiratory syncytial virus infection (PF-06928316) and pentavalent meningococcal (PF-06886992) vaccine candidates. We also expect to provide early clinical data for our mini-dystrophin gene therapy candidate (PF-06939926) in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and for our gene therapy program for Hemophilia A (PF-07055480), in collaboration with Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.

“We see attractive opportunities globally to deliver value to patients, payors and other stakeholders through a combination of innovative biopharmaceutical medicines, vaccines, biosimilars, legacy brands and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products. I believe we have the business structure, leadership team and financial capability firmly in place to drive continued success,” Dr. Bourla concluded.

Frank D’Amelio, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Global Supply, stated, “Overall, I was pleased with our 2018 financial performance. We were able to achieve 2% operational revenue growth for the year. We also delivered Adjusted diluted EPS(2) growth of 13% in 2018, primarily reflecting a lower effective tax rate on adjusted income(2) due to tax reform, higher adjusted other income(2), strong performance of certain key products and the net impact of our share repurchases. Regarding capital allocation decisions in 2018, we returned $20.2 billion directly to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and also announced a new joint venture for Pfizer Consumer Healthcare with GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK)(3), delivering on our commitment to complete the strategic review for our Consumer Healthcare business in 2018.

“Our 2019 financial guidance anticipates continued strong growth from key product franchises, including Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Xtandi as well as the expected loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in the U.S. in June 2019. The midpoint of our 2019 revenue guidance range implies comparable operational performance to 2018 while absorbing an anticipated $2.6 billion revenue headwind due to products that have recently lost or are expected to soon lose marketing exclusivity. Additionally, the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range for Adjusted diluted EPS(2) also implies comparable operational performance to 2018 when excluding the anticipated $0.06 unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on 2019 guidance as well as the $0.08 favorable impact on 2018 Adjusted diluted EPS(2) from net gains on equity investments, which will no longer be included in Adjusted(2) financial results. Notably, our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS(2) anticipates share repurchases totaling approximately $9 billion in 2019, which is currently expected to be offset by approximately half due to dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs,” Mr. D’Amelio concluded.

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Fourth-Quarter 2018 vs. Fourth-Quarter 2017) 

Fourth-quarter 2018 revenues totaled $14.0 billion, an increase of $274 million, or 2%, compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting operational growth of $657 million, or 5%, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $383 million, or 3%.

- 4 -

Innovative Health (IH) Highlights

▪IH revenues increased 10% operationally, primarily driven by continued growth from key brands including:

–Ibrance outside the U.S. grew significantly operationally, primarily driven by continued uptake in developed Europe and the December 2017 launch in Japan as well as the non-recurrence of a one-time price adjustment to full-year 2017 revenues, recorded in fourth-quarter 2017, related to finalizing reimbursement agreements in certain developed Europe markets;

–Eliquis globally, up 31% operationally, primarily driven by continued increased adoption in non-valvular atrial fibrillation as well as oral anti-coagulant market share gains;

–Xeljanz globally, up 37% operationally, primarily driven by continued uptake in the rheumatoid arthritis indication and, to a lesser extent, from the launches of the psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis indications in the U.S.; and

–Prevenar 13 in emerging markets, up 13% operationally, primarily due to continued momentum from the launch of the pediatric indication in China in the second quarter of 2017,

partially offset primarily by lower revenues for:

–Viagra in the U.S. due to its December 2017 loss of exclusivity and the resulting shift in the reporting of Viagra revenues in the U.S. and Canada to the Essential Health business at the beginning of 2018(4);

–Enbrel in most developed Europe markets, primarily due to continued biosimilar competition; and

–Xalkori globally, primarily due to competitive pressures.

Essential Health (EH) Highlights

▪EH revenues declined 3% operationally, negatively impacted primarily by:

–a 13% operational decline in the Legacy Established Products (LEP) portfolio in developed markets, primarily driven by industry-wide pricing challenges in the U.S. and generic competition;

–a 14% operational decline in the Sterile Injectable Pharmaceutical (SIP) portfolio in developed markets, primarily due to increased competition across the portfolio and continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.; and

–a 10% operational decline in the Peri-LOE Products portfolio in developed markets, primarily due to expected declines in Lyrica in developed Europe and Pristiq, partially offset by the addition of Viagra revenues from the U.S. and Canada that were previously recorded in the IH business,

partially offset primarily by:

- 5 -

–10% operational growth in emerging markets, primarily reflecting growth across the LEP and SIP portfolios in China; and 

–31% operational growth from Biosimilars in developed markets, primarily from Inflectra in certain channels in the U.S.

GAAP Reported(1) Income Statement Highlights

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Indicates calculation not meaningful or result is equal to or greater than 100%.

The increase in fourth-quarter 2018 other deductions––net(1) compared with the prior-year quarter was primarily driven by:

▪higher asset impairments charges, primarily associated with generic sterile injectable products acquired in connection with Pfizer’s 2015 acquisition of Hospira, Inc.; and

▪higher charges for certain legal matters,

partially offset primarily by:

▪the non-recurrence of net losses on the retirement of certain outstanding debt securities that were recorded in fourth-quarter 2017; and

▪higher net gains on asset disposals.

Pfizer’s effective tax rate on Reported income(1) for fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 compared to the prior year periods was unfavorably impacted primarily by:

▪the non-recurrence of a $10.7 billion tax benefit recorded in fourth-quarter 2017 to reflect the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA),

partially offset primarily by:

- 6 -

▪a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business; and

▪an increase in benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.

Adjusted(2) Income Statement Highlights

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Pfizer’s effective tax rate on Adjusted income(2) for fourth-quarter 2018 was unfavorably impacted primarily by:

▪the non-recurrence of tax benefits recorded in fourth-quarter 2017 related to the enactment of the TCJA, primarily reflecting the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were accrued during 2017 prior to the enactment of the TCJA, 

partially offset primarily by:

▪the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business; and

▪an increase in benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.

Pfizer’s effective tax rate on Adjusted income(2) for full-year 2018 was favorably impacted primarily by:

▪the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA;

▪the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business; and

▪an increase in benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.

- 7 -

Fourth-quarter 2018 diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate Reported(1) and Adjusted(2) diluted EPS declined by 152 million shares compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to Pfizer’s ongoing share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of share repurchases during 2018, partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.

A full reconciliation of Reported(1) to Adjusted(2) financial measures and associated footnotes can be found starting on page 23 of this press release.

FULL-YEAR REVENUE SUMMARY (Full-Year 2018 vs. Full-Year 2017)

Full-year 2018 revenues totaled $53.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 2%, compared to full-year 2017, reflecting operational growth of $791 million, or 2%, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $310 million, or less than 1%.

Full-year 2018 operational revenue growth of $791 million, or 2%, was primarily driven by:

▪certain key products, including Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz globally, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 primarily in emerging markets, as well as Inflectra primarily in the U.S. and developed Europe; and

▪emerging markets operational growth of $1.5 billion, or 13% (inclusive of the performance of the aforementioned products),

partially offset primarily by lower revenues for:

▪products that recently lost marketing exclusivity, which negatively impacted 2018 revenues by $1.7 billion operationally, primarily Viagra in the U.S., Enbrel and Lyrica in developed Europe as well as Relpax and Pristiq in the U.S.;

▪the LEP portfolio in developed markets, primarily driven by industry-wide pricing challenges in the U.S. and generic competition; and 

▪the SIP portfolio, primarily due to increased competition and legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.

RECENT NOTABLE DEVELOPMENTS (Since October 30, 2018)

Product Developments

▪Bavencio (avelumab)

–In December 2018, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA), and Pfizer announced that data from a planned interim analysis of the Phase 3 JAVELIN Ovarian 100 study of avelumab did not support the study’s initial hypothesis, and therefore the alliance made the decision to terminate 

- 8 -

the trial in alignment with the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Top-line results showed that the study, which evaluated avelumab in combination with and/or following platinum-based chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with ovarian cancer, would not achieve superiority in the pre-specified primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).

–In November 2018, Merck KGaA and Pfizer announced that the Phase 3 JAVELIN Ovarian 200 trial evaluating avelumab alone or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), a type of chemotherapy, compared with PLD did not meet the pre-specified primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) or PFS in patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory ovarian cancer. No new safety signals were observed for avelumab alone or in combination with PLD, and the safety profile for avelumab in this trial was consistent with that observed in the overall JAVELIN clinical development program. The data are currently being analyzed, and detailed results will be shared with the scientific community.

▪Daurismo (glasdegib) -- In November 2018, Pfizer announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Daurismo, a once-daily oral medicine, for the treatment of newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in adult patients who are 75 years or older or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. Daurismo is taken in combination with low-dose cytarabine, a type of chemotherapy. Daurismo has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment.

▪Lorbrena (lorlatinib) -- In November 2018, Pfizer announced that the FDA approved Lorbrena, a third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor for patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed on crizotinib and at least one other ALK inhibitor for metastatic disease; or whose disease has progressed on alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK inhibitor therapy for metastatic disease. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

▪Lyrica (pregabalin) -- In November 2018, Pfizer announced that the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity for Lyrica. This grant extends the period of U.S. market exclusivity for Lyrica by an additional six months, to June 30, 2019. The pediatric exclusivity determination was based on data from the Lyrica Pediatric Epilepsy Program, which were submitted in response to the FDA’s written request to Pfizer to evaluate the use of Lyrica as adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures in pediatric epilepsy patients. These were also required post-marketing studies.

▪Xtandi (enzalutamide) -- In December 2018, Astellas Pharma Inc. (Astellas) and Pfizer announced that the Phase 3 ARCHES trial evaluating Xtandi plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer met its primary endpoint, significantly improving radiographic 

- 9 -

progression-free survival versus ADT alone. The preliminary safety analysis of the ARCHES trial appears consistent with the safety profile of Xtandi in previous clinical trials in castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Pipeline Developments

A comprehensive update of Pfizer’s development pipeline was published today and is now available at www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline. It includes an overview of Pfizer’s research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as mechanism of action for some candidates in Phase 1 and all candidates from Phase 2 through registration.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

▪PF-06439535 (proposed biosimilar bevacizumab) -- In December 2018, Pfizer announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive 

- 10 -

opinion, recommending marketing authorization for Zirabev (PF-06439535), a proposed biosimilar to Avastin(9).

▪PF-06482077 (20-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine) -- In December 2018, Pfizer announced the initiation of a Phase 3 program for its 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) candidate, PF-06482077, for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in the vaccine in adults aged 18 years and older. This first Phase 3 trial will enroll an estimated 3,880 adults and is designed to compare immune responses after 20vPnC administration to responses in control subjects ≥60 years old receiving 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; evaluate the immunogenicity of 20vPnC in adults 18-59 years of age; and describe the 20vPnC safety profile in adults ≥18 years old.

▪PF-06651600 (JAK3) -- In January 2019, Pfizer announced the initiation of a pivotal Phase 2b/3 clinical trial for its oral JAK3 inhibitor, PF-06651600, for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata, a chronic autoimmune skin disease that causes hair loss on the scalp, face, or body, and currently has no approved therapies. The trial will enroll an estimated 660 patients and will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PF-06651600 in adults and adolescents (12 years and older) who have 50% or greater scalp hair loss. 

▪Tafamidis -- In January 2019, Pfizer announced that the FDA accepted for filing the company’s New Drug Applications (NDAs) for tafamidis for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Pfizer submitted two NDAs based on two forms of tafamidis: meglumine salt and free acid. The NDA for tafamidis meglumine (20 mg capsule) was granted Priority Review designation and has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA in July 2019. The tafamidis free acid form (61 mg capsule) will undergo a standard review and has a PDUFA goal date for a decision by the FDA in November 2019. The free acid form is bioequivalent to the 80 mg tafamidis meglumine dose, which was administered as four 20 mg capsules in the pivotal trial and was developed for patient convenience to enable a single capsule for daily administration.

▪Tanezumab (PF-4383119, RN624) -- Pfizer and Eli Lilly and Company today announced positive top-line results from a Phase 3 study evaluating tanezumab 2.5 mg or 5 mg in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis (OA) pain. The tanezumab 5 mg treatment arm met all three co-primary endpoints at 24 weeks, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in pain, physical function and the patients’ overall assessment of their OA compared to those receiving placebo. The tanezumab 2.5 mg treatment arm met two of the three protocol-defined co-primary efficacy endpoints compared to placebo, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in pain and physical function, while patients’ overall assessment of their OA was not statistically different than placebo. Patients enrolled in the study had experienced inadequate 

- 11 -

pain relief from or intolerance to at least three different classes of analgesics, and on average had OA for more than six years. 

Preliminary safety data showed that tanezumab was generally well tolerated during the 24-week treatment period, with similarly low rates of treatment discontinuations due to adverse events observed among patients taking tanezumab and placebo. The trial also included a 24-week safety follow-up period, for a total of 48 weeks of observation. Overall, rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA) was observed in 2.1% of tanezumab-treated patients and was not observed in the placebo arm. The ratio of RPOA type 1 (accelerated joint space narrowing) to RPOA type 2 (damage or deterioration of the joint) was 2:1, consistent with the ratio from the previously reported subcutaneous Phase 3 study in OA pain (A4091056). There was one event of osteonecrosis and one event of subchondral insufficiency fracture observed in tanezumab-treated patients, and no events were observed in the placebo arm. The rate of total joint replacement was similar across the tanezumab treatment groups and placebo. Detailed efficacy and safety results from this study will be submitted to a future medical congress.

Corporate Developments

▪At the start of the 2019 fiscal year(4), Pfizer began operating in its previously-announced new commercial structure, reorganizing operations into three businesses:

–Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group (PBG), a science-based innovative medicines business, which includes all of the Innovative Health business units (except Consumer Healthcare) as well as a new Hospital business unit that commercializes Pfizer’s global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines. Pfizer also incorporated its biosimilar portfolio into its Oncology and Inflammation & Immunology business units.

–Upjohn, a global, off-patent branded and generic established medicines business, which includes the majority of Pfizer’s off-patent solid oral dose legacy brands, including Lyrica, Lipitor, Norvasc, Viagra and Celebrex as well as certain generic medicines. To allow this business to act with speed and flexibility, it has distinct and fully-dedicated manufacturing, marketing, regulatory and, with some exceptions, enabling functions, which enhances its autonomy and positions it to operate as a true stand-alone business within Pfizer.

–Consumer Healthcare, which includes Pfizer’s over-the-counter medicines(6).

Pfizer will provide financial reporting to reflect this reorganization beginning in first-quarter 2019.

▪In December 2018, Pfizer entered into a definitive agreement with GSK under which the two companies have agreed to combine their respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that will operate globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange for contributing its Consumer Healthcare business, Pfizer will receive a 32% equity stake in the new company 

- 12 -

and GSK will own the remaining 68% of the new company. Upon the closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions including GSK shareholder approval and required regulatory approvals, Pfizer anticipates deconsolidating its Consumer Healthcare business and will begin to receive its pro rata share of the joint venture’s earnings and dividends, which will be paid on a quarterly basis. Pfizer will have the right to appoint three out of the nine members of the joint venture’s board. The transaction is expected to deliver $650 million in peak cost synergies and to be slightly accretive for Pfizer in each of the first three years after the close of the transaction.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(5)References to operational variances in this press release pertain to period-over-period growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange. The operational variances are determined by multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, the current period U.S. dollar results by the current period average foreign exchange rates and then multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year period average foreign exchange rates. Although exchange rate changes are part of Pfizer’s business, they are not within Pfizer’s control. Exchange rate changes, however, can mask positive or negative trends in the business; therefore, Pfizer believes presenting operational variances provides useful information in evaluating the results of its business.

(6)The 2019 financial guidance reflects the following: 

▪Pfizer does not provide guidance for GAAP Reported financial measures (other than revenues) or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP Reported financial measures on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on equity securities and potential future asset impairments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP Reported results for the guidance period. 

▪Does not assume the completion of any business development transactions not completed as of December 31, 2018, including any one-time upfront payments associated with such transactions. 

▪Reflects a full year of revenue and expense contributions from Consumer Healthcare(3). 

▪Reflects an anticipated negative revenue impact of $2.6 billion due to recent and expected generic and biosimilar competition for certain products that have recently lost or are anticipated to soon lose patent protection. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The adoption of certain new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2018 impacted our consolidated statements of income as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Presentation of Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Cost––We adopted a new accounting standard on January 1, 2018 that requires the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs be presented in Other (income)/deductions––net, and that the presentation be applied retrospectively. We adopted the presentation of the net periodic benefit costs other than service costs by reclassifying these costs from Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses and Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs to Other (income)/deductions––net. We have therefore reclassified the prior period net periodic benefit costs/(credits) to apply the retrospective presentation for comparative periods. See Note (5) below for additional information.

On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets, Hospira Infusion Systems (HIS). The operating results of HIS are included in the consolidated statement of income and EH’s operating results through February 2, 2017 and, therefore, our financial results, and EH’s operating results, for the fourth quarter of 2017 do not reflect any contribution from HIS global operations. Our financial results, and EH’s operating results, for full-year 2017 reflect approximately one month of HIS domestic operations and approximately two months of HIS international operations. Our financial results, and EH’s operating results, for full-year 2018 do not reflect any contribution from HIS global operations.

(1)Certain amounts in the reconciliation of GAAP reported to Non-GAAP adjusted information and associated notes may not add due to rounding. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The adoption of certain new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2018 impacted our consolidated statements of income. Among other items, GAAP Reported and Non-GAAP Adjusted amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 have been revised from previously reported amounts to reflect the retrospective adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018, as of January 1, 2018, requiring the reclassification of the non-service cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs to Other (income)/deductions––net from their classification within Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses and Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs. See Note (1) and Note (5) to Notes to Consolidated Statements of Income above and Note (3) below for additional information.

On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets, Hospira Infusion Systems (HIS). The operating results of HIS are included in the consolidated statement of income and EH’s operating results through February 2, 2017 and, therefore, our financial results, and EH’s operating results, for the fourth quarter of 2017 do not reflect any contribution from HIS global operations. Our financial results, and EH’s operating results, for full-year 2017 reflect approximately one month of HIS domestic operations and approximately two months of HIS international operations. Our financial results, and EH’s operating results, for full-year 2018 do not reflect any contribution from HIS global operations.

(f)Included in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income/(loss). Income taxes includes the tax effect of the associated pre-tax amounts, calculated by determining the jurisdictional location of the pre-tax amounts and applying that jurisdiction’s applicable tax rate. Income taxes recorded in fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 do not reflect any changes associated with the December 2017 enactment of the legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).

(5)Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income/(loss) and its components and diluted EPS/loss per share (LPS). Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement (as described in the Financial Review––Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income) section of Pfizer’s 2017 Financial Report, which was filed as Exhibit 13 to Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017), Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income/(loss) and its components and diluted EPS/LPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.

(6)Exclusive of amortization of intangible assets, except as discussed in footnote (7) below.

(7)Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.

See Note (1) and Note (5) to Notes to Consolidated Statements of Income, Note (3) to Notes to Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information Certain Line Items and Note (6) below for additional information.

On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets, Hospira Infusion Systems (HIS). The operating results of HIS are included in EH’s operating results through February 2, 2017 and, therefore, EH’s operating results for the fourth quarter of 2017 do not reflect any contributions from HIS global operations, while EH’s operating results for full-year 2017 reflect approximately one month of HIS domestic operations and approximately two months of HIS international operations. Financial results for 2018 do not reflect any contribution from HIS global operations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Viagra lost exclusivity in the U.S. in December 2017. In 2018, revenues for Viagra in the U.S. and Canada, which were reported in IH through 2017, were reported in EH (which reported all other Viagra revenues excluding the U.S. and Canada through 2017). Therefore, in 2018, total Viagra worldwide revenues were reported in EH.

The following organizational change impacted our operating segments in 2018:

•Effective in the first quarter of 2018, certain costs for Pfizer’s Strategy and Commercial Operations (StratCO) group, which were previously reported in the operating results of our operating segments and Corporate, are reported in Other Unallocated. StratCO costs primarily include headcount costs, vendor costs and data costs largely in support of Pfizer’s commercial operations. The majority of the StratCO costs reflect additional amounts that our operating segments would have incurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the periods presented. The reporting change was made to streamline accountability and speed decision making. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we reclassified approximately $124 million of costs from IH, approximately $62 million of costs from EH and approximately $30 million of costs from Corporate to Other unallocated costs to conform to the current period presentation. For full-year 2017, we reclassified approximately $468 million of costs from IH, approximately $176 million of costs from EH and approximately $70 million of costs from Corporate to Other unallocated costs to conform to the current period presentation.

The above tables and related footnotes below reflect our organization structure for the periods presented.

(a)WRD––the R&D expenses managed by our WRD organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our IH business until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the IH segment via the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRD organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, including EH R&D projects. WRD is also responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety-event activities.

(b)GPD––the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for the operational execution of clinical trials for both early-stage assets in the WRD portfolio as well as late-stage assets in the Innovative portfolio. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&D projects.

(c)Corporate––the costs associated with Corporate, representing platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement), the provision of medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties, transparency and disclosure activities, clinical trial results publication, grants for healthcare quality improvement and medical education, and partnerships with global public health and medical associations, as well as certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments. Effective in the first quarter of 2018, certain costs for StratCO, which were previously reported in the operating results of our operating segments and Corporate, are reported in Other Unallocated. For additional information, see note (d) below.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(e)Amounts for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 have been revised from previously reported amounts to reflect the retrospective adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018, as of January 1, 2018, requiring the reclassification of the non-service cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs to Other (income)/deductions––net from their classification within Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses and Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs.

For information purposes only, the following tables present reconciliations of our segment operating results to segment operating results including estimated Other costs generally associated with each segment.

The above tables and related footnotes reflect our organization structure for the periods presented.

(a)Total International represents Developed Europe region + Developed Rest of World region + Emerging Markets region. Details for these regions are described in footnotes (l) to (n) below, respectively, and the product revenues from these regions are described on pages 39 and 41.

(b)The Pfizer Innovative Health business encompasses Internal Medicine, Vaccines, Oncology, Inflammation & Immunology, Rare Disease and Consumer Healthcare.

(c)Lyrica revenues from all of Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia countries are included in Lyrica EH. All other Lyrica revenues are included in Lyrica IH. Total Lyrica revenues represent the aggregate of worldwide revenues from Lyrica IH and Lyrica EH.

(d)Viagra lost exclusivity in the U.S. in December 2017. In 2018, revenues for Viagra in the U.S. and Canada, which were reported in IH through 2017, were reported in EH (which reported all other Viagra revenues excluding the U.S. and Canada through 2017). Therefore, in 2018, total Viagra revenues were reported in EH. Total Viagra revenues in 2017 represent the aggregate of worldwide revenues from Viagra IH and Viagra EH.

(e)The Pfizer Essential Health business encompasses Legacy Established Products, Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals, Peri-LOE Products, Biosimilars, Pfizer CentreOne and Hospira Infusion Systems (HIS) (through February 2, 2017). On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets, HIS. The operating results of HIS are included in EH’s operating results through February 2, 2017 and, therefore, EH’s operating results for the fourth quarter of 2017 do not reflect any contributions from HIS global operations, while EH’s operating results for full-year 2017 reflect approximately one month of HIS domestic operations and approximately two months of HIS international operations. Financial results for 2018 do not reflect any contribution from HIS global operations.

(f)Legacy Established Products primarily include products that have lost patent protection (excluding Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals and Peri-LOE Products). In fourth-quarter 2017, we sold our equity share in Hisun Pfizer. As a result, effective in first-quarter 2018, Hisun Pfizer-related revenues, previously reported in emerging markets within All Other LEP and All Other SIP, are reported in emerging markets within Pfizer CentreOne.

(g)Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals includes branded and generic injectables (excluding Peri-LOE Products). In fourth-quarter 2017, we sold our equity share in Hisun Pfizer. As a result, effective in first-quarter 2018, Hisun Pfizer-related revenues, previously reported in emerging markets within All Other LEP and All Other SIP, are reported in emerging markets within Pfizer CentreOne.

(h)Peri-LOE Products includes products that have recently lost or are anticipated to soon lose patent protection. These products primarily include: Lyrica in Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia; worldwide revenues for Celebrex, Pristiq, Zyvox Vfend, Revatio and Inspra; and in 2018, Viagra revenues for all countries (and Viagra revenues for all countries other than the U.S. and Canada in 2017, see note (d) above).

(i)Biosimilars includes Inflectra/Remsima (biosimilar infliximab) in the U.S. and certain international markets, Nivestim (biosimilar filgrastim) in certain European, Asian and Africa/Middle Eastern markets and in the U.S. and Retacrit (biosimilar epoetin zeta) in the U.S. and certain European and Africa/Middle Eastern markets.

(j)Pfizer CentreOne includes revenues from our contract manufacturing and active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation, including sterile injectables contract manufacturing, and revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements, including with Zoetis Inc. In fourth-quarter 2017, we sold our equity share in Hisun Pfizer. As a result, effective in first-quarter 2018, Hisun Pfizer-related revenues, previously reported in emerging markets within All Other LEP and All Other SIP, are reported in emerging markets within Pfizer CentreOne.

(k)HIS (through February 2, 2017) includes Medication Management Systems products composed of infusion pumps and related software and services, as well as IV Infusion Products, including large volume IV solutions and their associated administration sets.

(l)Developed Europe region includes the following markets: Western Europe, Scandinavian countries and Finland.

(m)Developed Rest of World region includes the following markets: Japan, Canada, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

(n)Emerging Markets region includes, but is not limited to, the following markets: Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea), Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Central Europe and Turkey.

DISCLOSURE NOTICE: Except where otherwise noted, the information contained in this earnings release and the related attachments is as of January 29, 2019. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release and the related attachments as a result of new information or future events or developments.

This earnings release and the related attachments contain forward-looking statements about our anticipated future operating and financial performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and product candidates, including anticipated regulatory submissions, data read-outs, study starts, approvals, performance, timing of exclusivity and potential benefits of Pfizer’s products and product candidates, strategic reviews, capital allocation, business-development plans, the benefits expected from the reorganization of our commercial operations into three businesses effective at the beginning of our 2019 fiscal year, our acquisitions and other business development activities, our proposed transaction with GSK to combine our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture, our ability to successfully capitalize on growth opportunities or prospects, manufacturing and product supply and plans relating to share repurchases and dividends, among other things, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the fact that they use future dates or use words such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “likely,” “ongoing,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “assume,” “target,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “goal,” “objective,” “aim,” “seek” and other words and terms of similar meaning. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following:

▪the outcome of research and development activities, including, without limitation, the ability to meet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for our pre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as the possibility of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, including the possibility of unfavorable further analyses of existing clinical data;

•the risk we may not be able to successfully address all of the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or obtain approval from regulators, which will depend on myriad factors, including such regulator making a determination as to whether a product’s benefits outweigh its known risks and a determination of the product’s efficacy; regulatory decisions impacting labeling, manufacturing processes and/or other matters; and recommendations by technical or advisory committees, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, that may impact the use of our vaccines; 

▪the speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product launches may be achieved;

▪the outcome of post-approval clinical trials, which could result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of, a product that could affect its availability or commercial potential;

▪the success of external business-development activities, including the ability to identify and execute on potential business development opportunities, the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated time frame or at all, the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any such transactions, and the potential need to obtain additional equity or debt financing to pursue these opportunities which could result in increased leverage and impact our credit ratings;

▪competitive developments, including the impact on our competitive position of new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products, biosimilars and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates;

▪the implementation by the FDA and regulatory authorities in many other countries of an abbreviated legal pathway to approve biosimilar products, which could subject our biologic products to competition from biosimilar products, with attendant competitive pressures, after the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period and patent rights;

▪risks related to our ability to develop and launch biosimilars, including risks associated with “at risk” launches, defined as the marketing of a product by Pfizer before the final resolution of litigation (including any appeals) brought by a third party alleging that such marketing would infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by the third party, and access challenges for our biosimilar products where our product may not receive appropriate formulary access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to the innovator product;

▪the ability to meet competition from generic, branded and biosimilar products after the loss or expiration of patent protection for our products or competitor products;

▪the ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally;

▪difficulties or delays in manufacturing, including delays caused by natural events, such as hurricanes; supply shortages at our facilities; and legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions, debarment, voluntary recall of a product or failure to secure product approvals;

▪trade buying patterns;

▪the impact of existing and future legislation and regulatory provisions on product exclusivity;

- 43 -
