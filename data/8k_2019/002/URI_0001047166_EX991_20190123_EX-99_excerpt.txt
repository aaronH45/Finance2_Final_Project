United Rentals Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Results 

Reports Record Financial Results

STAMFORD, Conn. – January 23, 2019 – United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 20181. 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, total revenue increased 20.0% to $2.306 billion and rental revenue increased 20.8% to $1.989 billion. On a GAAP basis, the company reported fourth quarter net income of $310 million, or $3.80 per diluted share ("EPS"), compared with $897 million, or $10.45 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017. Adjusted EPS2 for the quarter was $4.85 per diluted share, compared with $11.37 for the same period in 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a net income benefit estimated at $689 million, or $8.03 per diluted share, associated with the enacted tax reform discussed below. Excluding this benefit, EPS and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been $2.42 and $3.34, respectively. The reduction in the tax rate discussed below contributed an estimated $0.68 and $0.86 to EPS and adjusted EPS, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 20183. 

For the quarter, year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA2 increased 18.0% to a company record $1.117 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 90 basis point to 48.4%. The decline in adjusted EBITDA margin primarily reflected the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2018. 

For the year, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) increased to a company record of 11.0%, while net cash provided by operating activities was $2.853 billion and free cash flow, excluding merger and restructuring related payments, set a company record at $1.334 billion.

CEO Comments

Michael Kneeland, chief executive officer of United Rentals, said, "We delivered strong fourth quarter results, including broad volume growth and rental rate improvement, in a year that leveraged our numerous competitive advantages. Our integration of major acquisitions expanded our service offering, and we gained traction from investments in fleet and technology. For the full year, we grew pro forma rental revenue by 10.5%, improved our adjusted EBITDA margin, and increased ROIC to a record 11%."

Kneeland continued, "Our momentum in the quarter gave us a strong start to 2019, when we expect to once again outpace the industry. By reaffirming our guidance, we’re underscoring our confidence in the cycle and our differentiation in the marketplace. Customer feedback, as well as key internal and external indicators, continue to point to healthy end-market activity. We remain focused on balancing growth, margins, returns and free cash flow to maximize shareholder value." 

2019 Outlook

The company reaffirmed the following outlook for the full year 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Impact of U.S. Tax Reform 

In 2018, we completed the accounting for the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"). We expect that we will continue to meaningfully benefit from the legislation. In particular, the combination of the lowering of the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and the full expensing of capital spending will materially exceed the impact of the repeal of Like-Kind Exchange provisions, which had allowed for the deferral of taxable gains on the sale of used equipment. 

Earnings per diluted share for 2018 was $13.12. The reduction in the tax rate discussed above contributed an estimated $2.36 to diluted earnings per share for 2018. The Tax Act impacted our 2017 results primarily due to (i) a one-time non-cash tax benefit estimated at $746 million, reflecting the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability using a U.S. federal tax rate of 21% and (ii) a one-time transition tax estimated at $57 million on our unremitted foreign earnings and profits. Earnings per diluted share for 2017 was $15.73, and the estimated per share benefit of the above items was $8.05.

7.Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort, as discussed below

Free Cash Flow and Fleet Size

For the full year 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.853 billion, and free cash flow was $1.271 billion after total rental and non-rental gross capital expenditures of $2.291 billion. For the full year 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.209 billion, and free cash flow was $907 million after total rental and non-rental gross capital expenditures of $1.889 billion. Free cash flow for the full years 2018 and 2017 included aggregate merger and restructuring related payments of $63 million and $76 million, respectively.

The size of the rental fleet was $14.18 billion of original equipment cost at December 31, 2018, compared with $11.51 billion at December 31, 2017. The age of the rental fleet was 47.9 months on an OEC-weighted basis at December 31, 2018, compared with 47.0 months at December 31, 2017.

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) 

ROIC was 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The company’s ROIC metric uses after-tax operating income for the trailing 12 months divided by average stockholders’ equity, debt and deferred taxes, net of average cash. To mitigate the volatility related to fluctuations in the company’s tax rate from period to period, the U.S. federal corporate statutory tax rates of 21% and 35% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, were used to calculate after-tax operating income. 

ROIC materially increased due to the reduced tax rates following the enactment of the Tax Act. If the 21% U.S. federal corporate statutory tax rate following the enactment of the Tax Act was applied to ROIC for all historic periods, the company estimates that ROIC would have been 10.8% and 10.6% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Share Repurchase Program

In July 2018, the company commenced its previously announced $1.25 billion share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2018, the company has repurchased $420 million of common stock under the program, which it intends to complete in 2019. 

Introduction of Fleet Productivity as a Key Operating Metric

The company is introducing Fleet Productivity as a comprehensive metric to provide greater insight into the decisions made by its managers to optimize the interplay of rental rates, time utilization and mix in rental revenue, in support of its growth and return objectives. Fleet Productivity can be thought of as the combined impact of the previously reported year-over-year changes in rental rates, time utilization and mix on rental revenue, in one statistic. 

As the company’s business and strategy have evolved, management believes that certain legacy metrics have become less insightful into the company’s performance and less comparable to historical results. While no single metric can fully capture the myriad of factors underpinning the company’s returns-based strategy, management believes that Fleet Productivity will be useful in assessing how the combination of discrete decisions made across rental rates, time utilization, and mix in rental revenue come together to support shareholder value. 

As illustrated on pages 35 and 36 of the Fourth Quarter 2018 Investor Presentation, the company is providing twelve quarters of historical perspective on Fleet Productivity to help investors understand the relationship between the metric and its previously shared individual components. The company plans to continue sharing this same quarterly information for the next two quarters and provide investors with related context on earnings conference calls. After the company’s second quarter 2019, it plans to phase out the quarterly disclosure of rental rates and time utilization as discrete stand-alone metrics. Additionally, after the fourth quarter of 2018, the company will no longer provide monthly perspective on rental rates and time utilization. 

Conference Call 

United Rentals will hold a conference call tomorrow, Thursday, January 24, 2019, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The conference call number is 855-458-4217 (international: 574-990-3618). The conference call will also be available live by audio webcast at unitedrentals.com, where it will be archived until the next earnings call. The replay number for the call is 404-537-3406, passcode is 9595889.

Non-GAAP Measures  

Free cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment. The equipment purchases and proceeds represent cash flows from investing activities. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, the impact on depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization, asset impairment charge and the loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility. The company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced; and (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, none of these measures should be considered as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or earnings per share under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. 

Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company is not able to provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such reconciliations would require a forward-looking balance sheet, statement of income and statement of cash flow, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company provides a range for its adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted EBITDA calculation. The company provides an adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.

ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GAAP RECONCILIATION

We define “earnings per share – adjusted” as the sum of earnings per share – GAAP, as reported plus the impact of the following special items: merger related costs, merger related intangible asset amortization, impact on rental depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, restructuring charge, asset impairment charge and loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility. Management believes that earnings per share - adjusted provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, earnings per share - adjusted is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, earnings per share - adjusted should not be considered an alternative to GAAP earnings per share. The table below provides a reconciliation between earnings per share – GAAP, as reported, and earnings per share – adjusted.

We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. Merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations. The historic acquisitions that have included merger related costs are RSC, which had annual revenues of approximately $1.5 billion prior to the acquisition, and National Pump, which had annual revenues of over $200 million prior to the acquisition. NES had annual revenues of approximately $369 million, Neff had annual revenues of approximately $413 million, BakerCorp had annual revenues of approximately $295 million and BlueLine had annual revenues of approximately $786 million.

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA GAAP RECONCILIATION

(In millions)

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment, and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.

FREE CASH FLOW GAAP RECONCILIATION 

(In millions)

We define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment. The equipment purchases and proceeds are included in cash flows from investing activities. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. However, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.
