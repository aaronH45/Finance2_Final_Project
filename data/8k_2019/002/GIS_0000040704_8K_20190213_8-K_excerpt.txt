We expect to incur approximately $130 million of net expenses related to these actions, including approximately $25 million of severance and approximately $105 million of other exit costs and project-related costs, primarily asset write-offs. We expect to pay approximately $30 million of net cash related to these actions. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021.
