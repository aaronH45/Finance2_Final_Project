Cash Returns to Shareholders

Dividends:

•Altria’s current annualized dividend rate is $3.20 per share, representing an annualized dividend yield of 7.2% as of January 25, 2019. 

•Altria paid approximately $5.4 billion in dividends for the full year. 

•Altria expects to maintain a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of Altria’s Board of Directors (Board).

Share Repurchase Program:

•Altria repurchased 27.9 million shares for the full year at an average price of $60.00 per share, for a cost of approximately $1.67 billion.

•As of December 31, 2018, Altria had approximately $345 million remaining in the current $2 billion share repurchase program, which Altria expects to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2019. The timing of share repurchases depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors, and this program remains subject to the discretion of the Board.

Transactions

•Altria entered into an agreement to acquire newly issued shares in Cronos Group Inc. (Cronos Group), a leading global cannabinoid company, headquartered in Toronto, Canada. These shares represent a 45% equity stake for an investment of approximately $1.8 billion (approximately CAD $2.4 billion).1 The agreement includes a warrant, if exercised in full, to acquire an additional 10% equity stake in Cronos Group at an expected cost of approximately $1.0 billion (approximately CAD $1.4 billion).1 

◦Altria submitted its application for regulatory review under the Investment Canada Act in late December. 

◦Cronos Group’s shareholder vote is scheduled for February 21, 2019.

◦Altria still expects the transaction to close in the first half of 2019. 

•Altria signed and closed a $12.8 billion investment in JUUL, the U.S. leader in e-vapor, representing a 35% economic interest. Altria intends to file its application for antitrust approval shortly.

•Altria financed the JUUL transaction through a $14.6 billion term loan facility arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. $1.8 billion of the facility remains undrawn and may be used by Altria to finance its investment in Cronos Group. Altria expects to access the credit and capital markets to refinance the debt prior to maturity.

Innovation

•USSTC will present at the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) meeting on February 6 and 7, 2019, related to its modified risk tobacco product application for Copenhagen Snuff.

•PM USA is ready to deploy its initial lead market plans for IQOS upon authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

Cost Reduction Program

•In December 2018, Altria announced a cost reduction program that it expects will deliver approximately $575 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2019 (Cost Reduction Program). The program includes, among other things, third-party spending reductions across the business and workforce reductions. Altria recorded pre-tax charges of $121 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to the program.

2019 Full-Year Guidance

Altria forecasts its guidance for 2019 full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.27, representing a growth rate of 4% to 7% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.99 in 2018, which excludes the special items in Table 1. Altria’s 2019 guidance reflects its expectation for a higher full-year adjusted effective tax rate, primarily resulting from lower dividends from AB InBev; increased interest expense from the debt incurred from the Cronos Group and JUUL transactions; savings from the Cost Reduction Program, which Altria expects to build over the course of the year to an annualized level of approximately $575 million; and increased investments related to PM USA’s lead market plans for launching IQOS, once authorized by the FDA. The guidance assumes little-to-no earnings or cash contributions from the Cronos Group and JUUL investments. Altria expects the adjusted diluted EPS growth to come in the last three quarters of 2019. In the first quarter of 2019, Altria will have the increased 

2

interest expense without the full benefits of the Cost Reduction Program and one fewer shipping day in the smokeable products segment. 

This guidance range excludes estimated per share charges in 2019 of: (i) $0.04 of tax expense resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Act) related to a tax basis adjustment to Altria’s AB InBev investment; (ii) $0.04 for acquisition-related costs associated with the Cronos Group and JUUL transactions; and (iii) $0.04 for the Cost Reduction Program. 

Altria expects the 2019 full-year total domestic cigarette industry volume decline rate will be in a range of 3.5% to 5%. 

Altria expects its 2019 full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of approximately 23.5% to 24.5%.

Altria expects its 2019 capital expenditures to be between $225 million and $275 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $240 million.

Altria’s full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance and full-year forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, gain/loss on AB InBev/SABMiller plc (SABMiller) business combination, AB InBev special items, certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer (NPM) adjustment disputes under the Master Settlement Agreement (such dispute resolutions are referred to as NPM Adjustment Items).

Altria’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on its reported diluted EPS and its reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, may be infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result, Altria does not provide a corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted EPS guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast.

The factors described in the “Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements” section of this release represent continuing risks to Altria’s forecast.

Financial Performance

Fourth Quarter

•Net revenues were essentially unchanged at $6.1 billion. Revenues net of excise taxes increased 1.5% to $4.8 billion. 

•Reported diluted EPS decreased 74.6% to $0.66, primarily driven by lower 2017 income taxes resulting from benefits from the Tax Reform Act and higher 2018 asset impairment, exit, implementation and acquisition-related costs.

•Adjusted diluted EPS increased 4.4% to $0.95, primarily driven by lower income taxes and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower adjusted equity earnings from AB InBev.

Full Year

•Net revenues declined 0.8% to $25.4 billion, as lower net revenues in the smokeable products segment were partially offset by higher net revenues in the smokeless products segment. Revenues net of excise taxes increased 0.7% to approximately $19.6 billion. 

•Reported diluted EPS decreased 30.7% to $3.68, primarily driven by lower 2017 income taxes resulting from benefits from the Tax Reform Act; higher asset impairment, exit, implementation and acquisition-related costs; 

3

and the 2017 gain on the AB InBev/SABMiller business combination. These results were partially offset by higher reported equity earnings from AB InBev (which included AB InBev special items) and fewer shares outstanding.

•Adjusted diluted EPS increased 17.7% to $3.99, primarily driven by lower income taxes, fewer shares outstanding, higher adjusted equity earnings from AB InBev and higher adjusted operating companies income (OCI) in the smokeless products segment, partially offset by lower adjusted OCI in the smokeable products and wine segments and higher spending in the innovative tobacco products businesses.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Retail share results for cigarettes are based on data from IRI/MSAi, a tracking service that uses a sample of stores and certain wholesale shipments to project market share and depict share trends. This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes. For other trade classes selling cigarettes, retail share is based on shipments from wholesalers to retailers (STARS). This service is not designed to capture sales through other channels, including the internet, direct mail and some illicitly tax-advantaged outlets. It is IRI’s standard practice to periodically refresh its services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.

•Total smokeless industry volume declined by an estimated 1.5% over the past six months. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: Volume includes cans and packs sold, as well as promotional units, but excludes international volume, which is not material to the smokeless products segment. New types of smokeless products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing smokeless products, may or may not be equivalent to existing moist smokeless tobacco (MST) products on a can-for-can basis. To calculate volumes of cans and packs shipped, one pack of snus, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST. 

Brand Activity and Retail Share

IRI refreshed its smokeless products database in the first quarter of 2018, which affected previously released retail share results.

Brand Activity

•USSTC announces plans to expand Skoal Long Cut Cool Spearmint nationally. 

Retail Share

•Copenhagen full-year retail share grew 0.3 share points to 34.4% and Skoal retail share declined 0.1 share point to 16.2% compared to their share in the fourth quarter of 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Retail share results for smokeless products are based on data from IRI InfoScan, a tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share and depict share trends. This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes on the number of cans and packs sold. Smokeless products is defined by IRI as moist smokeless and spit-free tobacco products. New types of smokeless products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing smokeless products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis. For example, one pack of snus, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST. Because this service represents retail share performance only in key trade channels, it should not be considered a precise measurement of actual retail share. It is IRI’s standard practice to periodically refresh its InfoScan services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.

Basis of Presentation

Altria reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. Altria’s management reviews OCI, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, the segments. Altria’s management also reviews OCI, OCI margins and diluted EPS on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items, including those items noted under “2019 Full-Year Guidance.” Altria’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of Altria’s underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis. Altria’s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate. Altria’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. Altria’s management uses adjusted financial measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. These adjusted financial measures are not consistent with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of historical adjusted financial measures to corresponding GAAP measures are provided in this release.

Altria uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in AB InBev and reports its share of AB InBev’s results using a one-quarter lag because AB InBev’s results are not available in time to record them in the concurrent period. The one-quarter reporting lag does not affect Altria’s cash flows. Altria initially accounts for its investment in JUUL as an investment in an equity security. If and when antitrust clearance is obtained, Altria expects to account for its investment in JUUL under the equity method of accounting.

Altria’s reportable segments are smokeable products, including combustible cigarettes and cigars manufactured and sold by PM USA, Middleton and Nat Sherman; smokeless products, including moist smokeless tobacco and snus products manufactured and sold by USSTC; and wine, produced and/or distributed by Ste. Michelle. Results for innovative tobacco products (including Nu Mark LLC’s e-vapor products; VERVE; and IQOS) and PMCC are included in “All Other.”

Comparisons are to the corresponding prior-year period unless otherwise stated.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

This release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

11

Important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the projections and forward-looking statements included in this press release are described in Altria’s publicly filed reports, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2018. These factors include the following: significant competition; changes in adult consumer preferences and demand for Altria’s operating companies’ products; fluctuations in raw material availability, quality and price; reliance on key facilities and suppliers; reliance on critical information systems, many of which are managed by third-party service providers; fluctuations in levels of customer inventories; the effects of global, national and local economic and market conditions; changes to income tax laws; federal, state and local legislative activity, including actual and potential federal and state excise tax increases; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions; the effects of price increases related to excise tax increases and concluded tobacco litigation settlements, consumption rates and consumer preferences within price segments; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; privately imposed smoking restrictions; and, from time to time, governmental investigations. 

Furthermore, the results of Altria’s tobacco businesses are dependent upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully; to anticipate and respond to evolving adult consumer preferences; to develop, manufacture, market and distribute products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers (including, where appropriate, through arrangements with, and investments in, third parties); to improve productivity; and to protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases.

Altria and its tobacco businesses are also subject to federal, state and local government regulation, including by the FDA. Altria and its subsidiaries continue to be subject to litigation, including risks associated with adverse jury and judicial determinations, courts reaching conclusions at variance with the companies’ understanding of applicable law, bonding requirements in the limited number of jurisdictions that do not limit the dollar amount of appeal bonds and certain challenges to bond cap statutes.

In addition, the factors related to Altria’s investment in AB InBev include the following: the risk that Altria’s equity securities in AB InBev are subject to restrictions on transfer until October 10, 2021; the risk that Altria’s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in AB InBev and the dividends paid by AB InBev on shares owned by Altria may be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and other factors, including the risks encountered by AB InBev in its business; the risk that the tax treatment of Altria’s transaction consideration from the AB InBev/SABMiller business combination and the accounting treatment of its equity investment are not guaranteed; and the risk that the tax treatment of Altria’s investment in AB InBev may not be as favorable as Altria anticipates.

The factors related to Altria’s investment in JUUL include the following: the possibility that regulatory approvals required for the conversion of the shares into voting shares may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all; and that such approvals may be subject to unanticipated conditions; the possibility that the expected benefits of the transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe, if at all; the potential inaccuracy of the financial projections (including, without limitation, projections relating to JUUL’s domestic growth and international expansion); prevailing economic, market, regulatory or business conditions, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting the parties; the risk that Altria is not able to secure permanent financing for the transaction on favorable terms, if at all, and the risk of a downgrade in Altria’s credit ratings; risks that the transaction disrupts JUUL’s current plans and operations; the fact that Altria’s reported earnings and financial position and any future dividends paid by JUUL on shares owned by Altria may be adversely affected by tax and other factors, including the risks encountered (including, without limitation, regulatory and litigation risks) and decisions made by JUUL in its business; risks related to the investment disrupting Altria, JUUL or their respective management; and risks relating to the effect of announcement of the transaction on JUUL’s ability to retain and hire key personnel or on its relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties.

The factors related to Altria’s investment in Cronos Group include the following: the possibility that the parties may not be able to consummate the transaction as expected; the possibility that one or more of the conditions to the consummation of the transaction may not be satisfied; the possibility that regulatory or shareholder approvals required for the transaction may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all; the parties’ ability to meet expectations regarding the timing, completion, and other matters relating to the transaction; any event that could give rise to the termination of the agreement between Altria and Cronos Group; the possibility that the expected benefits of the 

12

transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe, if at all; the potential inaccuracy of the financial projections; prevailing economic, market, or business conditions negatively affecting the parties; risks relating to the financing of the transaction, including the risk that Altria is not able to secure permanent financing for the transaction on favorable terms, if at all, and the risk of a downgrade in Altria’s credit ratings; risks that the transaction disrupts Cronos Group’s current plans and operations; the fact that Altria’s reported earnings and financial position and any dividends paid by Cronos Group on shares owned by Altria may be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, tax and other factors, including the risks encountered by Cronos Group in its business; risks related to the disruption of the transaction to Altria, Cronos Group and their respective management; and risks relating to the effect of announcement of the transaction on Cronos Group’s ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties.

Altria cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not complete and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that it may make except as required by applicable law. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Altria or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referenced above.
