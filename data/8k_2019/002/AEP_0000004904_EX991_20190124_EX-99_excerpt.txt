COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan 24, 2019 - American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP) today reported fourth-quarter 2018 earnings, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), of $363 million or $0.74 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $401 million or $0.81 per share in fourth-quarter 2017. Operating earnings for fourth-quarter 2018 were $354 million or $0.72 per share, compared with operating earnings of $420 million or $0.85 per share in fourth-quarter

2017. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure representing GAAP earnings excluding special items. 

Year-end 2018 GAAP earnings were $1.924 billion or $3.90 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $1.913 billion or $3.89 per share for year-end 2017. Year-end 2018 operating earnings were $1.945 billion or $3.95 per share, compared with operating earnings of $1.808 billion or $3.68 per share for year-end 2017.

The difference between fourth-quarter 2018 GAAP and operating earnings was largely due to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, partially offset by impairments related to the Conesville Plant.

The difference between year-end 2018 GAAP and operating earnings was largely due to severance charges, primarily related to announced plant closures, and generation plant impairments. These impacts were partially offset by the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

A full reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date is included in the tables at the end of this news release.

“Our strong earnings performance in 2018 was driven by a robust economy, our focus on investments to enhance service for our customers and very favorable weather during most of the year. In 2018, AEP delivered a total shareholder return of 5.4 percent, exceeding the 4.2 percent total return for the S&P 500 Electric Utilities Index. Over the past five years, we’ve provided a total shareholder return of more than 92 percent, exceeding both the broader S&P 500 Index total return of 50 percent and the 65 percent total return for the S&P 500 Electric Utilities Index,” said Nicholas K. Akins, AEP chairman, president and chief executive officer.

“Last year, we experienced the highest number of heating and cooling degree days in 30 years. That favorable weather allowed us to increase our discretionary spending significantly from 2017 levels in areas that will improve service to customers,” Akins said. 

“Investments in our transmission business remain on track and continue to support our year-over-year earnings growth. Our Transmission Holding Co. business contributed $0.75 per share to ongoing earnings, and net plant assets for that business grew $1.4 billion in 2018, an increase of 21 percent. 

“We ended 2018 with the highest load growth we have seen since 2011 with normalized load growth in nearly every state we serve,” Akins said. “The significant economic boost we saw early in 2018 from tax reform and a more robust job market was tempered later in the year by tariffs and a stronger dollar. We expect positive economic activity to continue in 2019, especially related to oil and gas development,” Akins said.

EARNINGS GUIDANCE 

Management reaffirms its 2019 operating earnings guidance range of $4.00 to $4.20 per share. Operating earnings could differ from GAAP earnings for matters such as impairments, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. AEP management is not able to forecast if any of these items will occur or any amounts that may be reported for future periods. Therefore, AEP is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for earnings guidance.

AEP’s earnings are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and represent the company’s earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company’s operating earnings, a non-GAAP measure representing GAAP earnings excluding special items as described in the news release and charts, provide another representation for investors to evaluate the performance of the company’s ongoing business activities.
