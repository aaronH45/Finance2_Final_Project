 Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement      

As previously disclosed, Signet Jewelers Limited (the “Company”) has been cooperating with investigations by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“CFPB”) and Attorney General for the State of New York (“NY AG”) related to the Company’s in-store credit practices, promotions, and payment protection products. On January 16, 2019, without admitting or denying any of the allegations, findings of fact or conclusions of law (except to establish jurisdiction), the Company’s subsidiary, Sterling Jewelers Inc. (“Sterling”), reached a settlement and entered into a consent order (the “Consent Order”) with the CFPB and NY AG. Pursuant to the Consent Order, Sterling will pay civil money penalties of $10 million to the CFPB and $1 million to the NY AG. The Company will recognize the related $11 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter ending February 2, 2019. The Consent Order also includes certain compliance actions the Company must undertake, including continuing to maintain policies and procedures related to the issuance of credit cards, including with respect to credit applications, credit financing terms and conditions and any related add-on products, such as payment-protection insurance, that are reasonably designed to ensure consumer knowledge or consent, and submitting a report to the CFPB and NY AG within 90 days describing compliance with the Consent Order. 

A copy of the Consent Order is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Consent Order set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to its full text.
