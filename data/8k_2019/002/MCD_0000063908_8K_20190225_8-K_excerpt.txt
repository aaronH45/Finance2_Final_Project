Item 8.01. Other Events.

In September 2018, McDonald’s Corporation (the “Company”) announced several organizational changes to its global business structure as a result of the Company's continued evolution to a more heavily franchised structure. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company operates under a new organizational structure with the global business segments listed below.

•U.S. - the Company’s largest market. This segment did not change as a result of the new organizational structure.

•International Operated Markets - comprised of wholly-owned markets, or countries in which the Company operates restaurants, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain and the U.K.

•International Developmental Licensed Markets - comprised of primarily developmental license and affiliate markets in the McDonald’s system. Corporate activities will also be reported in this segment.

The Company’s new reporting segments are aligned with its strategic priorities and reflect how management now reviews and evaluates operating performance. The new organizational structure is designed to support the Company's efforts toward driving growth through the Velocity Growth Plan.

Starting with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2019, the Company’s new reporting segments will be presented as described above. The Company will present prior periods in accordance with the new reporting segments in future quarterly and annual filings.

The Company is issuing this Current Report on Form 8-K in order to provide investors with segment summary financial information and segment historical data that is consistent with its new organizational structure. The schedules in Exhibit 99.1 provide unaudited summary financial information and other data according to the new reporting segments for the previously reported years ended December 31, 2016 through 2018, and the previously reported quarters in the year ended December 31, 2018. 

This information in no way revises or restates the Company’s previously reported consolidated financial statements for any period. It does not change the Company's previously reported total assets, liabilities or shareholders' equity or its reported net income or earnings per share, nor does it reflect any subsequent information or events, other than as required to reflect the change in reporting segments as described above. This information should be read in conjunction with our previously filed reports.
