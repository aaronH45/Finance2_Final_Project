PINNACLE WEST REPORTS 2018 FULL-YEAR AND FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS

•Full-year 2018 results benefit from strong operational performance and prior year’s collaborative rate agreement

•An expanding Arizona economy and customer growth drive increase in retail revenue

PHOENIX - Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $511.0 million, or $4.54 per diluted share, for full-year 2018. This result compares with net income of $488.5 million, or $4.35 per share, in 2017.

“Strong operational performance and a robust Arizona economy helped us achieve solid 2018 results at the top of our earnings guidance,” said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt. “And, by operating efficiently and safely, our employees provided our 1.2 million customers with clean, reliable and affordable electricity.”

“Whether it’s operating Palo Verde Generating Station, the nation’s largest producer of clean-energy; quickly restoring electric service after a violent monsoon storm; or holding the line on operational costs,” Brandt said, “our employees’ commitment to our customers defines who we are as a company.”

As an example of the company’s commitment to keep rates affordable, APS was among the first energy companies in the nation to return the benefits of federal tax reform to customers. Disciplined operational cost management has enabled the company to limit price increases to less than the rate of inflation over the last 25 years. In fact, earlier this month, APS lowered monthly bills more than $3 on average for residential customers. Added to the $119 million in savings passed along to customers from federal tax reform, the average APS customer’s monthly bill is $9.59 less than it was on March 1, 2018.

Brandt cited several additional examples of the company’s 2018 achievements:

•For the seventh straight year, Pinnacle West increased its common dividend, raising it by 6.1 percent. In addition, Pinnacle West’s total shareholder value increased $341 million and total return to shareholders was 3.6 percent in 2018.

•Palo Verde Generating Station achieved its 27th consecutive year as the nation’s largest power producer - generating 31.1 million megawatt-hours of carbon-free electricity. The plant achieved a 90 percent capacity factor and completed its spring planned refueling outage in 28 days and 13 hours - the shortest in plant history.

•APS ranked fifth nationally for solar energy and is an industry leader in battery storage. Combining Palo Verde, solar and other renewables, and energy efficiency, APS serves its customers with an energy mix that is 50 percent clean.

•And, for the benefit of customers in 2019, APS expanded its crisis bill support to customers in need by $1.5 million for a total of $2.75 million, $500,000 of which was designated for Arizonans affected by the federal government shutdown.

Looking forward, Brandt said the company will keep working in partnership with customers and policy makers “to support Arizona’s sustained growth and continue to advance a clean-energy vision.”

The 2018 full-year financial results comparison was positively impacted by the following major factors:

•The company’s 2017 multi-party rate agreement, including new residential rate designs and seasonal rates, increased results by $0.73 per share. The agreement, which included APS’s first retail base rate increase in five years, took effect Aug. 19, 2017.

•Higher transmission revenues improved results $0.18 per share compared to 2017.

•Adoption of new accounting guidance and higher market returns for pension and other post-retirement benefits positively impacted results by $0.17 per share.

•Greater retail sales revenue - excluding the effects of weather variations - increased earnings $0.16 per share due to customer growth of 1.7 percent and changes in customer usage patterns, partially offset by energy efficiency and distributed generation. 

•The net effect of miscellaneous items increased results $0.11 per share.

The above positive factors were offset in part by the following factors:

•Operating expenses, including higher depreciation and amortization and increased taxes other than income taxes, reduced results by $0.52 per share compared with the prior-year, primarily due to increased plant in service.

•Higher operations and maintenance expenses reduced results by $0.50 per share. The increased costs were largely the result of higher planned outage and operating costs, including at the Four Corners Power Plant to install added emission controls; higher corporate support expenses related to information technology and implementation of new customer systems; an increase in transmission, distribution and customer service costs at APS; and an increase in public outreach costs at the parent company primarily associated with the Proposition 127 ballot initiative. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in employee benefit costs and the absence of capital projects at the Navajo Generating Station, a coal power plant slated to close at year-end 2019.

•The net effect of adjusted income taxes, including the benefits of federal corporate tax cuts, offset by non-deductible costs and other items, decreased earnings by $0.08 per share.

•The effects of weather variations negatively impacted results by $0.06 per share compared to a year-ago. 

For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, Pinnacle West reported higher consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $26.1 million, or $0.23 per diluted share. This result compares with net income of $21.6 million, or $0.19 per share, for the same period a year ago.

The 2018 fourth-quarter results comparison versus 2017 was positively impacted by higher retail sales revenue, including residential rate design and seasonal rates; recovery of lost revenue resulting from customer energy efficiency and distributed generation programs; adoption of new 

accounting guidance and higher market returns for pension and other post-retirement benefits; and lower operations and maintenance expenses. These factors were partially offset by income taxes, net of tax refunds, and the effects of weather.

Financial Outlook

The company reaffirmed its 2019 consolidated earnings will be within a range of $4.75 to $4.95 per diluted share, and expects to achieve a consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5 percent.
