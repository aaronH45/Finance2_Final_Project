Eversource Energy Reports Full Year 2018 Results 

HARTFORD, Conn. and BOSTON, Mass. (February 20, 2019) – Eversource Energy (NYSE: ES) today reported full-year 2018 earnings of $1.033 billion, or $3.25 per share, compared with earnings of $988 million, or $3.11 per share, in 2017. Full-year 2018 results include two items from the third quarter disclosed previously—a charge of $26 million, or $0.08 per share, associated with Eversource Energy’s investment in a natural gas pipeline project, and non-recurring tax benefits of $18 million, or $0.06 per share. 

In the fourth quarter of 2018, Eversource Energy earned $231.3 million, or $0.73 per share, compared with earnings of $237.4 million, or $0.75 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017.  

“We completed a very successful year in 2018 for both our customers and shareholders. We continued to provide top-tier levels of safe and reliable electric, natural gas and water service for nearly 4 million New England customers, despite some significant challenges that Mother Nature threw our way,” said Jim Judge, Eversource chairman, president and chief executive officer. “We also continued to provide our shareholders with an attractive and growing dividend and strong share price performance. We also provided strong leadership in helping our region achieve its ambitious environmental and carbon emission reduction goals.” 

2019 and Long-Term Earnings Per Share (EPS) Guidance 

Also today, Eversource Energy projected 2019 earnings of between $3.40 per share and $3.50 per share, and long-term EPS growth through 2023 of between 5 percent and 7 percent, using 2018 earnings of $3.25 per share as the base.  

Electric Distribution and Generation 

Eversource Energy’s electric distribution segment earned $455.4 million for the full year 2018, compared with $497.4 million for the full year 2017. The segment earned $76.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Lower fourth quarter and full-year results were due primarily to the divestiture of Eversource’s New Hampshire fossil and hydro plants in 2018, and higher depreciation, interest and property tax expense, primarily in Connecticut.  

Electric Transmission 

Eversource Energy’s transmission segment earned $427.2 million for the full year 2018, compared with $391.9 million for the full year 2017. It earned $97.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $102.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Higher full-year earnings in 2018 were due primarily to an increased level of investment in Eversource Energy transmission facilities. Lower fourth-quarter earnings in 2018 reflect a reduction in the benefits from tax reform, compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Natural Gas Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s natural gas distribution segment earned $93.2 million for the full year 2018, compared with $74.6 million for the full year 2017. Fourth quarter natural gas segment earnings were $43 million in 2018, compared with $25.5 million in 2017. Higher results in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 were driven primarily by higher distribution margins1 and the impacts of the 2018 rate review at Yankee Gas Services Company. 

Water Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s water distribution segment earned $30.9 million for the full year 2018 and $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The segment was created by Eversource’s acquisition of Aquarion Water Company in December 2017. 

Eversource Energy Parent and Other Companies 

Eversource Energy parent and other companies earned $26.3 million for the full year of 2018, compared with $25.3 million for the full year 2017. It earned $10.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with earnings of $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Higher results were due to a lower effective tax rate in 2018.

1 Utility electric margin and utility natural gas margin are non-GAAP (not determined using generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures. All per-share amounts in this news release are reported on a diluted basis. The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource Energy. The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business, but rather represent a direct interest in Eversource Energy's assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to common shareholders of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource Energy common shares outstanding for the period. Management believes that these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of Eversource Energy’s businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to Eversource Energy’s consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of Eversource Energy’s operating performance.
