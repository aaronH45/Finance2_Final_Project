Pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement, Mr. Klappa’s 2019 annual base salary was set at $1,000,000 and his target award under the Company’s short-term performance plan at 100% of base salary, both prorated to reflect the date he assumes the role of Executive Chairman. Otherwise, Mr. Klappa’s compensatory arrangement will remain substantially the same. The agreement also provides that Mr. Klappa’s employment is at-will. At this time, Mr. Klappa and the Compensation Committee have not agreed to any additional compensatory arrangements.
