Explanatory Note

As previously reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K originally filed on February 1, 2019 (the “Original Form 8-K”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (“CenterPoint Energy”), on February 1, 2019, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of April 21, 2018, by and among CenterPoint Energy, Vectren Corporation, an Indiana corporation (“Vectren”), and Pacer Merger Sub, Inc., an Indiana corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy (“Merger Sub”), CenterPoint Energy, Vectren and Merger Sub consummated the previously announced agreement to merge Merger Sub with and into Vectren (the “Merger”), with Vectren continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy.

This Current Report on Form 8-K/A (this “Form 8-K/A”) amends the Original Form 8-K in order to include the historical financial statements of Vectren Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Vectren”) and the pro forma financial information required by Item 9.01 of Form 8-K.
