        "Income tax adjustments. Income tax adjustments include the difference between income taxes based on a forecasted annual non-GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP tax rate as a result of the timing of certain non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments. During the quarter, the company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allowed within the one-year measurement period. The income tax adjustments include the companyâ€™s estimates related to the current status of the rules and regulations governing the transition to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These adjustments are excluded because they are infrequent and the company believes that they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business."
