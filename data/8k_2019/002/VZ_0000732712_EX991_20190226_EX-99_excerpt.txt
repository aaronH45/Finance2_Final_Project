Verizon announces early participation results of its private  

exchange offers for 19 series of debt securities  

NEW YORK – Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) (NYSE, NASDAQ: VZ) today announced the early participation results, as of 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on February 25, 2019 (the “Early Participation Date”), of its previously announced offers to exchange the outstanding series of debt securities listed in the table below (the “Old Notes”) for newly issued debt securities of Verizon (the “New Notes”) (the “Exchange Offers”), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum dated February 8, 2019, as amended by Verizon’s press release dated February 20, 2019 (the “Amended Terms Press Release”) related to the Exchange Offers (the “Offering Memorandum” and, together with the accompanying letter of transmittal and eligibility letter, the “Exchange Offer Documents”).  

The withdrawal rights for each Exchange Offer expired at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on February 25, 2019. The Exchange Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on March 11, 2019, unless extended or earlier terminated by Verizon.  

Verizon’s obligation to accept Old Notes tendered in each of the Exchange Offers is subject to the terms and conditions described in the Exchange Offer Documents,   

including, among other things, (i) the Acceptance Priority Procedures (as described in Verizon’s press release dated February 8, 2019 announcing the Exchange Offers (the “Launch Press Release”)) and (ii) a $4.0 billion cap on the aggregate principal amount of New Notes Verizon issues in exchange for Old Notes validly tendered in the Exchange Offers (the “New Notes Cap”).  

As all conditions applicable to the Exchange Offers as of the Early Participation Date have been deemed satisfied or waived by Verizon and the Minimum Issue Requirement (as defined in the Launch Press Release) has been met, Verizon expects to settle all Old Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Participation Date on February 28, 2019 (the “Early Settlement Date”), subject to the terms of the Exchange Offers, including the New Notes Cap. Because the aggregate principal amount of New Notes to be issued in exchange for Old Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Participation Date and accepted for exchange is expected to equal the New Notes Cap, Verizon anticipates that there will be no Final Settlement Date (as defined in the Launch Press Release) with respect to the Exchange Offers, and no additional tenders of Old Notes will be accepted for purchase by Verizon in the Exchange Offers after the Early Participation Date.  

Verizon was advised by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, as the Information Agent and the Exchange Agent, that as of the Early Participation Date, the aggregate principal amounts of the Old Notes specified in the final column in the table below were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn with respect to each of the Exchange Offers:

Promptly after 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) today, February 26, 2019, Verizon will issue a press release specifying, among other things, (i) the Total Exchange Price (as defined in the Launch Press Release) for each series of Fixed Rate Notes (as defined in the Launch Press Release), (ii) the New Notes Coupon (as defined in the Launch Press Release), (iii) the aggregate principal amount of Old Notes validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Participation Date and accepted for exchange in each Exchange   

 Offer, (iv) the proration factor (if any) to be applied and (v) the aggregate principal amount of New Notes to be issued on the Early Settlement Date.  

When issued, the New Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws. Therefore, the New Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. Verizon will enter into a registration rights agreement with respect to the New Notes on the Early Settlement Date.
