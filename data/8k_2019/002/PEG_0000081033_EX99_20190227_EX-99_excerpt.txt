PSEG ANNOUNCES 2018 RESULTS  

NET INCOME OF $2.83 PER SHARE  

NON-GAAP OPERATING EARNINGS OF $3.12 PER SHARE  

Non-GAAP 2019 Operating Earnings Guidance $3.15 - $3.35 Per Share  

(February 27, 2019 – Newark, NJ) Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) reported 2018 Net Income of $1,438 million, or $2.83 per share, as compared to Net Income of $1,574 million, or $3.10 per share, for 2017. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the year 2018 were $1,582 million, or $3.12 per share, compared to $1,488 million, or $2.93 per share for 2017. The Net Income comparison for the full year reflects the absence of one-time items including the favorable impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (Tax Act) in 2017, charges in 2017 related to the early retirement of the Hudson and Mercer generating units and higher charges in 2017 related to the REMA leveraged leases. Full year 2018 results include the recognition of net unrealized losses on Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) equity securities as a result of new accounting rules, partially offset by lower Mark to Market (MTM) losses and a gain related to the sale of the retired Hudson and Mercer generating units.  

PSEG also reported Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2018 of $199 million, or $0.39 per share. This compares to Net Income of $956 million, or $1.88 per share in 2017’s fourth quarter. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $284 million, or $0.56 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $289 million, or $0.57 per share. The Net Income comparison for the fourth quarter reflects the absence of one-time favorable impacts of the Tax Act in 2017 and includes the recognition of net unrealized losses on Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) equity securities as a result of new accounting rules, partially offset by lower MTM losses and gains related to the sale of the retired Hudson and Mercer generating units and the disposition of the REMA leveraged leases.  

“We closed 2018 with solid operating and financial performance, with full-year non-GAAP Operating Earnings per share 6.5% above 2017 results” said Ralph Izzo, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We achieved important regulatory and policy objectives during 2018 including the settlement of PSE&G’s distribution base rate case, supporting the economic viability of our New Jersey nuclear units with the state’s passage of Zero Emission Certificates (ZECs) that recognize their carbon free attributes, and the landmark filing of PSE&G’s $3.6 billion Clean Energy Future proposal in support of New Jersey’s Clean Energy policy goals. As we continue our progress in executing PSEG’s $12-$17 billion capital program over the 2019 to 2023 period building critical energy infrastructure, including the Gas System  

1   

 Modernization Program II (GSMP II) and Energy Strong II (ES II), PSEG is also focused on our Powering Progress initiatives designed to bring the power of energy efficiency to more of our customers. Throughout 2018, our dedicated workforce responded to challenging weather and system conditions with operational excellence, and executed on a full regulatory and policy agenda. As a result of these efforts, we are well positioned to continue executing our capital investment programs to provide long-term benefits for our customers and to create value for our shareholders. The recent action by the Board of Directors to increase the common dividend by $0.08 to the indicative annual rate of $1.88 per share underscores our dual commitment to maintain financial strength and drive growth initiatives.”  

The tables below provide a reconciliation of PSEG’s Net Income to non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the full year and fourth quarter. See Attachments 10 and 11 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings.

Ralph Izzo went on to say, “As we begin 2019, we continue to pursue our growth objectives through regulated infrastructure and Clean Energy investments at PSE&G and complete our combined cycle construction program at Power. For 2019, we expect to grow non-GAAP Operating Earnings by over 4% at the mid-point of our guidance of $3.15 - $3.35 per share. Notably, the earnings contribution of PSE&G will comprise approximately 75% of our 2019 Operating Earnings at the midpoint of our guidance, and continues to represent over 90% of our planned capital investment program over the 2019 – 2023 period. This capital investment is projected to produce 7% to 9% compound annual growth in rate base over this period, starting from a year-end 2018 rate base of $19 billion, which is over $2 billion higher than 2017’s year-end rate base.”

Results and Outlook by Operating Subsidiary  

See Attachments 5 and 6 for detail regarding the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year reconciliations for each of PSEG’s businesses.  

PSE&G  

PSE&G reported Net Income of $239 million ($0.47 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2018 bringing full year Net Income to $1,067 million ($2.10 per share). In 2017, PSE&G reported Net Income of $220 million ($0.43 per share) and $973 million ($1.92 per share) for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, compared with non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $210 million ($0.41 per share) and $963 million ($1.90 per share) for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, respectively.  

PSE&G’s Net Income in the fourth quarter reflects new electric and gas rates put into effect on November 1, 2018 following the conclusion of the utility’s first distribution base rate case since 2010, and the continued growth in earnings resulting from investment in Transmission and Distribution infrastructure. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) approved a settlement of the rate case last October that authorized a $212 million annual base revenue increase, a return on equity of 9.6% and a 54% equity percentage of capitalization. The base revenue increase is offset by a flow back to customers of an annual $225 million via a five-year tax adjustment clause which returns certain tax benefits (accumulated excess deferred income taxes) from lower corporate income tax rates resulting from the Tax Act in December 2017.  

3   

Growth in PSE&G’s investment in transmission improved quarter-over-quarter Net Income comparisons by $0.04 per share. Gas margin improved by $0.06 per share as a result of rate relief and recovery of investment in gas distribution made under the Gas System Modernization Program. Electric margin improved by $0.02 per share reflecting rate relief, as well as higher volumes and demand. Changes to the accounting treatment of the non-service component of pension and other post-retirement benefit (OPEB) expenses resulted in a favorable $0.02 per share comparison over 2017’s fourth quarter. These positives were partially offset by $0.05 of higher operating and maintenance expense in the quarter associated with increased tree trimming and higher corrective maintenance. In addition, depreciation expense increased by $0.02 per share reflecting higher plant balances, and taxes and other were $0.01 per share higher compared with 2017’s fourth quarter.  

For the full-year, weather-normalized residential electric sales were 0.6% higher and weather-normalized residential gas sales rose by 3.3%.  

For the 17th year in a row, PSE&G was recognized as ReliabilityOne’s Most Reliable Electric Utility in the Mid-Atlantic region, and was also awarded the 2018 Outstanding Customer Reliability Experience Award highlighting PSE&G’s outage reporting and restoration communications.  

PSE&G’s Net Income for 2019 is forecasted at $1,200 million—$1,230 million reflecting incremental investments in Transmission and Distribution and a full year of rate relief.  

PSEG Power  

PSEG Power reported a Net Loss of $35 million ($0.07 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus Net Income of $610 million ($1.20 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year 2018, PSEG Power reported Net Income of $365 million ($0.72 per share) versus Net Income for the full year 2017 of $479 million ($0.94 per share).  

PSEG Power reported non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $57 million ($0.11 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2018 and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $176 million bringing full year non-GAAP Operating Earnings to $502 million ($0.99 per share) and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to $1,059 million. On a comparative basis, PSEG Power reported non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $100 million ($0.20 per share) and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $196 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $505 million ($1.00 per share) and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $1,172 million for the full year 2017.  

Power’s fourth quarter Net Loss includes net unrealized losses in NDT equity securities, MTM activity, and a gain related to the sale of the retired Hudson and Mercer generating units.  

4   

A scheduled increase in capacity prices in New England and PJM improved fourth quarter Net Income comparisons by $0.04 per share. The average price received on energy hedges declined in the quarter, as re-contracting led to a $0.09 reduction in results compared to last year’s fourth quarter. The increase in generation output for the quarter improved Net Income comparisons by $0.03 per share. Gas operations declined by $0.02 per share, as higher natural gas prices lowered commodity margin and impacted off-system sales following the start-up of the Atlantic Sunrise gas pipeline that has enabled price convergence of Leidy gas with higher prices at Henry Hub. A decline in Power’s O&M expense improved Net Income comparisons by $0.01 per share. Interest expense ($0.03 per share) and depreciation expense ($0.02 per share) both rose as a result of the two new combined cycle units in service at mid-year. Higher taxes reduced Net Income comparisons by $0.01 over the prior year’s fourth quarter, as the absence of investment tax credits and other items offset the benefit of tax reform.  

Output from Power’s generating facilities in the fourth quarter increased by 19% over fourth quarter 2017, mainly from new capacity additions at Sewaren and Keys and from higher output at our other New Jersey combined cycle units. Quarterly comparisons were also influenced by increased demand in response to an extended period of cold weather that ran from mid-November to mid-December. Output of 56 TWh was at the high end of our forecast provided at the end of the third quarter, which called for full year output of 54 - 56 TWh. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 86.9% in the quarter, resulting in a full year capacity factor of 91.4%. For the year, nuclear production totaled 31.2 TWh. Power’s gas-fired CCGT fleet operated at an average capacity factor of approximately 51% in the quarter resulting in a full-year capacity factor of 52%, producing 18.5 TWh of electricity for the year, up approximately 36% year-over-year. For the quarter, output from the coal fleet was up 10%, primarily from the Pennsylvania units, in response to higher weather related demand. For the full year, output from the coal fleet increased 7% to 5.7 TWh as an increase in gas prices improved its competitiveness.  

Power is forecasting an increase in output for 2019 to 60 - 62 TWh, up 2 TWh since the third quarter 2018 update. Following completion of the recent Basic Generation Service (BGS) auction in New Jersey, approximately 80% - 85% of production for the year is hedged at an average price of $37 per MWh. For 2020, Power has hedged 55% - 60% of forecast production of 60 - 62 TWh at an average price of $38 per MWh. Power is also forecasting output for 2021 of 60 - 62 TWh. Approximately 15% - 20% of Power’s output in 2021 is hedged at an average price of $42 per MWh. The forecast for 2019 - 2021 includes generation associated with the full-year production contribution of 1,300 MWs of gas-fired combined cycle capacity at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland and Sewaren in New Jersey; the mid-2019 commercial operation of the 485 MW gas-fired combined cycle generating unit in Bridgeport Harbor, Connecticut; and the mid-2021 retirement of the 383 MW Bridgeport Harbor coal-fired generating station.  

For 2019, non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA at PSEG Power are forecast to be $395 million - $460 million and $1,030 million - $1,130 million, respectively. The Operating Earnings guidance for 2019 reflects the benefits of including a partial year of ZECs and the contribution from three new CCGT units, offset by lower pricing on re-contracting, lower capacity revenues, higher interest expense due to the absence of capitalized interest on construction, and higher taxes due to the absence of the nuclear carryback benefit in 2018.  

5   

PSEG Enterprise/Other  

PSEG Enterprise/Other reported a Net Loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 of $5 million ($0.01 per share) compared to Net Income of $126 million ($0.25 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, PSEG Enterprise/Other reported Net Income of $6 million, ($0.01 per share) compared to Net Income in 2017 of $122 million ($0.24 per share). The results for 2018 reflect the absence of a one-time, non-cash earnings benefit of $147 million related to the Tax Act and a decrease in Energy Holdings’ deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by an after-tax charge related to REMA, LLC in 2017.  

PSEG Enterprise/Other reported a non-GAAP Operating Earnings loss for the fourth quarter 2018 of $12 million ($0.02 per share) compared to a non-GAAP Operating Earnings loss of $21 million ($0.04 per share) in the year-ago quarter. The results for the fourth quarter brought PSEG Enterprise/Other non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the full year to $13 million ($0.03 per share) versus $20 million ($0.03 per share) in 2017.  

The decline in fourth quarter non-GAAP Operating Earnings loss versus the fourth quarter 2017 primarily reflects the absence of certain tax charges at Holdings taken in the fourth quarter of 2017, lower overall tax expense in 2018 as a result of the Tax Act, and higher interest expense mostly offset by lower donations in 2018.  

For 2019, non-GAAP Operating Earnings for PSEG Enterprise/Other are forecast to be at $5 million – $10 million. The 2019 guidance for Enterprise/Other reflects continued PSEG Long Island results largely offset by higher interest expense.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Management uses non-GAAP Operating Earnings in its internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing PSEG’s financial performance to previous financial results. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings exclude the impact of returns (losses) associated with the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting and material one-time items such as the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and the impact of the retirement of the Hudson and Mercer coal stations on Power.  

6   

Management believes the presentation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for Power is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Management also believes that non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure operating performance without regard to items such as income tax expense, interest expense and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon, among other things, the book value of assets, capital structure and whether assets were constructed or acquired. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA also allows investors and other users to assess the underlying financial performance of our fleet before management’s decision to deploy capital. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP Operating Earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense and depreciation and amortization.  

See Attachments 10 and 11 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is intended to complement, and should not be considered an alternative to the presentation of Net Income, which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.  

Due to the forward looking nature of non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA guidance, PSEG is unable to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management is unable to project certain reconciling items, in particular MTM and NDT gains (losses), for future periods due to market volatility.
