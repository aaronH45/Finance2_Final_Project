[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Full year 2019 reported diluted EPS expected to be greater than $5.16, and adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to be greater than $6.40. 

SECAUCUS, N.J., February 14, 2019 - Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2018.

"In 2018 we grew revenues, adjusted earnings and cash from operations despite some challenges in the marketplace. Quest is well positioned once again in 2019 to deliver on our commitment to grow revenues and earnings, as our in-network status now extends to approximately 90% of commercially insured lives in the U.S.," said Steve Rusckowski, Chairman, CEO and President. "Our guidance for 2019 reflects significant reimbursement pressure offset by strong volume growth and continued execution of our Invigorate program. I am pleased to report our volumes for the year are off to a good start."

(a)Net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 have been restated to reflect the impact of new revenue recognition rules that became effective January 1, 2018 and were adopted on a full retrospective basis. Under the new rules, the company reports uncollectible balances associated with

patient responsibility as a reduction in net revenues; historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.

(b)For further details impacting the year-over-year comparisons related to operating income, operating income as a percentage of net revenues, net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, and diluted EPS, see note 2 of the financial tables attached below.

(c)As discussed in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, recording revenues and accounts receivable involves judgment and estimation. The company follows a standard process, which considers historical denial and collection experience and other factors, to estimate contractual allowances and implicit patient price concessions, and regularly updates its estimates, recording adjustments in the current period as changes in estimates. Based on this process, during the fourth quarter the company increased its reserves for revenues and accounts receivable. 

Guidance for Full Year 2019

The company estimates full year 2019 results as follows:

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures

As used in this press release the term “reported” refers to measures under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The term “adjusted” refers to non-GAAP measures as follows: (i) for the purpose of income measures the term “adjusted” refers to operating performance measures that exclude special items such as the effect of changes in tax law on our deferred tax assets (liabilities) and reserves, restructuring and integration charges, excess tax benefit ("ETB") associated with stock-based compensation and other items; and (ii) the term “adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense” represents the company's diluted EPS before the impact of special items (described above) and amortization expense.

Non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. Non-GAAP adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. Management may use these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, as well as to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess our performance. The additional tables attached below include reconciliations of adjusted measures to GAAP measures.

(a)For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, represents costs primarily associated with workforce reductions, systems conversions and integration incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, represents costs primarily associated with systems conversions, integration and workforce reductions incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of restructuring and integration charges on the company's consolidated statements of operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(b)For the three months ended December 31, 2018, primarily represents the loss on the sale of a foreign subsidiary. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, primarily represents costs incurred related to certain legal matters and a loss on the sale of a foreign subsidiary which were partially offset by a gain associated with the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with our Mobile Medical Examination Services, LLC acquisition and an insurance claim for hurricane related losses.

For the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily represents non-cash asset impairment charges and incremental costs incurred as a result of hurricanes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, primarily represents non-cash asset impairment charges associated with an investment, non-cash asset impairment charges and incremental costs incurred as a result of hurricanes and costs incurred related to certain legal matters, partially offset by a gain on the sale of an interest in an equity method investment. 

The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of these other items on the company's consolidated statement of operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(c)For the restructuring and integration charges and other items, income tax impacts, where recorded, were primarily calculated using combined tax rates of 25.5% and 38.7% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, other items also includes the impact of recording a valuation allowance against certain net operating loss carryforwards in a geography impacted by hurricanes. The following table summarizes the income tax benefit associated with the special items:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d)For the three months ended December 31, 2018, represents an income tax expense associated with finalizing the impact of the enactment of TCJA. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, represents an income tax benefit associated with a change in a tax return accounting method that enabled the company to accelerate the deduction of 

9

certain expenses on its 2017 tax return at the federal corporate statutory tax rate in effect during 2017 partially offset by an income tax expense associated with finalizing the impact of the enactment of TCJA. 

For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, represents the net estimated tax benefit associated with the TCJA. The company recorded an estimated net income tax benefit of $106 million in 2017 associated with the TCJA, including a deferred income tax benefit of $115 million primarily due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities and reserves at the new combined federal and state tax rate, partially offset by $9 million of current tax expense primarily due to the mandatory repatriation toll charge on undistributed foreign earnings and profits.

(e)Represents the impact of amortization expense on diluted earnings per common share, net of the income tax benefit. The income tax benefit was primarily calculated using combined tax rates of 25.5% and 38.7% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The pre-tax amortization expense that is excluded from the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense is recorded in the company's statements of operations as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4)For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operations benefited from a decrease in 2018 tax payments of $159 million primarily due to the impact of TCJA, partially offset by lower operating income in 2018 as compared to 2017 and timing of movements in our working capital accounts. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operations benefited from a $62 million decrease in 2017 tax payments associated with the realization of a deferred tax benefit and improved operating performance.

5)The outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense represents management’s estimates for the full year 2019 before the impact of special items, including ETB, and amortization expense. Further impacts to earnings related to special items may be incurred throughout 2019. Additionally, the amount of ETB is dependent upon employee stock option exercises and the company's stock price, which are difficult to predict. The following table reconciles our 2019 outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to the corresponding amount determined under GAAP:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Represents estimated full year pre-tax charges of $125 million primarily associated with systems conversions and integration costs incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. Income tax benefits were calculated using a combined tax rate of 25.5%. 

(b)Represents the estimated impact of amortization expense for 2019 on the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. Amortization expense used in the calculation is as follows (dollars in millions):
