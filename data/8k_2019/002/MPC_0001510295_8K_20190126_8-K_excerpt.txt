Synergy Incentive Awards

As previously disclosed, on November 8, 2018, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (the “Company”) established a special performance unit incentive program (the “Synergy Incentive Program”) and established performance targets for the bonus opportunities (“Synergy Incentive Awards”) to be granted thereunder.

On January 26, 2019, the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Company’s Board of Directors approved Synergy Incentive Awards, effective February 1, 2019, for certain executive officers of the Company. In general, the bonuses that may be earned under the Synergy Incentive Awards (“Synergy Bonuses”) are payable in cash upon the achievement of specified, previously disclosed amounts of cumulative annual gross synergies (“Achieved Synergies”). The Synergy Bonuses will generally vest and be payable following completion of each of three performance periods. Earlier vesting provisions may apply in the event of a participant’s death or termination of employment, a change in control of the Company, or if the Achieved Synergies reach $2.0 billion prior to the completion of the third and final performance period.

Synergy Bonuses for results between the applicable threshold, target and maximum levels will be interpolated on a straight-line basis to determine the percentage of the Synergy Bonuses earned; provided, however, that Synergy Bonuses for results above target for the third performance period will be calculated as an amount equal to the greater of (a)(i) the product of the performance units awarded on the grant date multiplied by the payout percentage for the third performance period minus (ii) the sum of the Synergy Bonuses paid with respect to the first performance period and the second performance period, and (b) the performance units allocated to the third performance period multiplied by the applicable payout percentage for the third performance period. The Compensation Committee has sole and absolute authority and discretion to reduce the Synergy Bonus payout for any performance period as it may deem appropriate.

The threshold, target and maximum Synergy Bonuses that may be earned under the Synergy Incentive Awards granted to Gary R. Heminger, Timothy T. Griffith, Donald C. Templin and Anthony R. Kenney are set forth in the tables below.

C. Michael Palmer Award Acceleration

Consistent with previous disclosure by the Company, C. Michael Palmer, Executive Vice President, retired on January 1, 2019. In light of Mr. Palmer’s nearly 42 years of service to the Company and its predecessors and his strong leadership, performance and contributions to the success of the Company, on January 26, 2019, the Company took action to accelerate the vesting of his unvested performance units and restricted stock awards and provide for the payout of his performance units without the application of a pro rata adjustment that would otherwise have applied to such units by virtue of his retirement. Additionally, on January 24, 2019, MPLX GP LLC, the general partner of MPLX LP (“MPLX”), took action to accelerate the vesting of Mr. Palmer’s outstanding MPLX performance units and phantom unit awards and provide for the payout of his performance units without the application of a pro rata adjustment that would otherwise have applied to such units by virtue of his retirement.
