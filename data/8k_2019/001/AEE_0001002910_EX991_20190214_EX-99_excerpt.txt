Ameren Announces 2018 Results 

and Issues Guidance[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•2019 Diluted EPS Guidance Range Established at $3.15 to $3.35

•2018 through 2023 Growth Rate Guidance Established

ST. LOUIS (Feb. 14, 2019) — Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2018 net income attributable to common shareholders in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $815 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, compared to 2017 GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of $523 million, or $2.14 per diluted share. Excluding certain tax-related items reflected below, Ameren recorded 2018 core earnings of $828 million, or $3.37 per diluted share, compared to 2017 core earnings of $691 million, or $2.83 per diluted share.

The year-over-year increase in 2018 core earnings reflected higher Ameren Missouri electric retail sales primarily due to warmer summer and colder winter temperatures, as well as earnings on increased infrastructure investments made at Ameren Transmission, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. The comparison also benefited from the absence, in 2018, of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center and higher Ameren Missouri electric service rates, effective April 1, 2017. These favorable factors were partially offset by increased Ameren Missouri other operations and maintenance expenses, primarily reflecting higher-than-normal scheduled non-nuclear energy center outages, increased routine maintenance, and more distribution reliability projects. The comparison also reflected higher charitable donations in 2018. 

"In 2018, we again delivered strong earnings growth," said Warner L. Baxter, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. “Our team continues to successfully execute all elements of our strategy across our businesses. We made meaningful progress on the proposed ownership of at least 700 megawatts of 

Page 1 of 6

wind generation by Ameren Missouri to better serve our customers, transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio and comply with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard."

"I am also pleased to report that today, Ameren Missouri filed its Smart Energy Plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission. Driven by the passage of constructive legislation in 2018, this five-year plan includes significant incremental investments to modernize the electric grid for the benefit of our customers and the state while keeping rates stable and predictable," Baxter said. "Constructive energy policies have driven similar investments at our Ameren Illinois electric distribution business and have delivered significant customer benefits and added new jobs to the state's economy while keeping customer rates affordable."

Ameren recorded GAAP and core net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2018, of $68 million, or 28 cents per diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders of $60 million, or 24 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2017. Excluding a tax-related item reflected below, Ameren recorded core earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, of $94 million, or 39 cents per diluted share. 

The year-over-year decrease in fourth quarter 2018 core earnings reflected a 12 cent per diluted share timing difference between income tax expense and revenue reductions at Ameren Missouri related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that had no effect on full-year earnings. In addition, Ameren Missouri had increased other operations and maintenance expenses, primarily reflecting higher non-nuclear energy center maintenance and more distribution reliability projects. The comparison also reflected higher charitable donations in 2018. These factors were partially offset by earnings on increased infrastructure investments made at Ameren Transmission, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, as well as from the absence, in 2018, of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center that increased operations and maintenance expenses in the year-ago period. The comparison also benefited from higher Ameren Missouri electric retail sales primarily due to colder winter temperatures compared to near-normal temperatures in the year-ago period.

As reflected in the table below, the following items were excluded from the prior year fourth quarter and full-year 2017 and 2018 core earnings:

•A non-cash charge for a true-up to the revaluation of deferred taxes associated with the TCJA resulting primarily from proposed regulations related to bonus depreciation issued in August 2018, which decreased 2018 earnings by $13 million.

•A non-cash charge, primarily at the parent company, for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a December 2017 change in federal law (TCJA) that decreased the federal corporate income tax rate, which decreased 2017 earnings by $154 million. 

•A non-cash charge at the parent company for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a July 2017 change in Illinois law that increased the state's corporate income tax rate, which decreased 2017 earnings by $14 million.

Earnings Guidance

Ameren expects diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.15 to $3.35 for 2019 and to grow at a 6% to 8% compound annual rate from 2018 through 2023, using 2018 core diluted earnings per share, less the 2018 Ameren Missouri estimated favorable weather impact of 32 cents per diluted share, as the base. This multi-year earnings growth is expected to be driven by projected rate base growth of approximately 8% compounded annually from 2018 through 2023. Earnings growth in any individual year will be impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, regulatory rate reviews, Callaway refueling and maintenance outages, and weather, among other factors. 

"Looking ahead, we plan to continue to deliver strong long-term earnings per share growth reflecting a robust pipeline of investments in critical energy infrastructure that will deliver long-term benefits to our customers and the communities we serve, while keeping customer rates competitive and affordable," Baxter said. 

Ameren's earnings guidance for 2019 and multi-year growth expectations assume normal temperatures and are subject to the effects of, among other things: 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields; regulatory, judicial and legislative actions; energy center and energy distribution operations; energy, economic, capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release. 

Ameren Missouri Segment Results

Ameren Missouri 2018 GAAP and core earnings were $478 million and $482 million, respectively, compared to 2017 GAAP and core earnings of $323 million and $359 million, respectively. Core earnings for 2018 and 2017 excluded non-cash charges associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes that decreased earnings by $4 million and $36 million, respectively. Year-over-year core earnings benefited from higher electric retail sales, primarily due to warmer summer and colder winter temperatures, which increased earnings by an estimated $102 million, as well as the absence, in 2018, of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center, which favorably affected the comparison by $21 million. The comparison also benefited from higher electric service rates, 

Page 3 of 6

effective April 1, 2017. These favorable factors were partially offset by increased other operations and maintenance expenses, primarily reflecting higher-than-normal scheduled non-nuclear plant outages, increased routine maintenance work, and more distribution reliability projects. 

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution Segment Results

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution 2018 GAAP and core earnings were $136 million and $139 million, respectively, compared to 2017 earnings of $131 million. Core earnings in 2018 excluded a $3 million non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased earnings on infrastructure investments, as well as a higher allowed return on equity due to a higher average 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield in 2018 compared to 2017. 

Ameren Illinois Natural Gas Segment Results

Ameren Illinois Natural Gas 2018 GAAP and core earnings were $70 million and $71 million, respectively, compared to 2017 earnings of $60 million. Core earnings in 2018 excluded a $1 million non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased earnings on infrastructure investments and new service rates effective Nov. 9, 2018.

Ameren Transmission Segment Results

Ameren Transmission 2018 earnings were $164 million, compared to 2017 earnings of $140 million. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased earnings on infrastructure investments. 

Other Results (includes items not reported in a business segment)

Other results for 2018 were a GAAP and core loss of $33 million and $28 million, respectively, compared to a 2017 GAAP loss of $131 million and core earnings of $1 million. Core results for 2018 and 2017 excluded non-cash charges that decreased earnings by $5 million and $132 million, respectively, reflecting the revaluation of deferred taxes. The decrease in year-over-year core results primarily reflected higher charitable donations and lower net state and federal income tax benefits.

Analyst Conference Call

Ameren will conduct a conference call for financial analysts at 9 a.m. Central Time on Thursday, Feb. 14, to discuss 2018 earnings, earnings guidance and other matters. Investors, the news media and the public may listen to a live broadcast of the call at AmerenInvestors.com by clicking on "Webcast" under "Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call," where an accompanying slide presentation will also be available.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this release, Ameren has presented core earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP information to non-GAAP information has been included in this release. Generally, core earnings or losses include earnings or losses attributable to common shareholders and exclude income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as the third quarter 2017 non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a July 2017 change in Illinois law that increased the state's corporate income tax rate, the fourth quarter 2017 non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a December 2017 change in federal law that decreased the federal corporate income tax rate, and the third quarter 2018 non-cash charge for a true-up to the revaluation of deferred taxes associated with the TCJA resulting primarily from regulations related to bonus depreciation issued in August 2018. Ameren uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core earnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods. In providing core earnings guidance, there could be differences between core earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as that described above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such future items.

Forward-looking Statements

Given these uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements. Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or future events.
