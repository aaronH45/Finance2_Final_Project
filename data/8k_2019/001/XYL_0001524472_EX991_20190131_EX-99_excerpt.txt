RYE BROOK, N.Y., January 31, 2019 - Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported fourth quarter 2018 net income of $225 million, or $1.24 per share. Excluding the impact of restructuring, realignment and special charges, the Company delivered adjusted net income of $159 million or $0.88 per share in the quarter, a 16-percent increase over the prior year period. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9 percent organically. Revenue for the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in the Utility and Commercial end markets along with eight percent growth in Industrial. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) improved by 40 basis points year-over-year to 20.6 percent driven by productivity, volume leverage and price realization. Reported operating margin in the quarter was 14.0 percent and adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 15.1 percent, including a 20-basis-point impact due to purchase accounting amortization. 

For the full year 2018, Xylem generated $5.2 billion in revenue, up 11 percent on a reported basis and eight percent on an organic basis. Full-year reported net income was $549 million, or $3.03 per share, a 66% increase over the prior year. Reported operating margin was 12.6 percent, up 90 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted net income, which excludes the impact of restructuring, realignment and special charges, was $522 million, or $2.88 per share, a 20-percent increase over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA improved by 80 basis points to 19.5 percent year-over-year. Xylem delivered a full-year 2018 adjusted operating margin of 13.7 percent, up 40 basis points versus the prior year including a 20-basis-point impact due to purchase accounting amortization.

“We continued to build strong momentum throughout 2018, generating solid revenue and orders growth across each of our business lines,” said Patrick Decker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Xylem. “With our expanded digital offerings and leveraging our extensive installed base, we delivered significant 

value to our customers, and demand for our solutions grew across all of our end markets. We are well-positioned as we begin the year and focused on delivering each of our 2019 commitments and long-term financial objectives.”

Xylem announced that its Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.24 per share, an increase of 14 percent. The dividend is payable on March 14, 2019, to shareholders of record as of February 14, 2019.

Full-year 2019 Outlook 

Xylem forecasts full-year 2019 revenue in the range of $5.3 to $5.4 billion, up two to four percent. On an organic basis, Xylem’s revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of four to six percent. 

Full-year 2019 adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 14.7 to 15.2 percent, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $3.20 to $3.40. This represents an increase of 11 to 18 percent from Xylem’s 2018 adjusted results. The Company’s adjusted earnings outlook excludes projected restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $30 million for the year. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort.

Fourth Quarter Segment Results

Water Infrastructure

Xylem’s Water Infrastructure segment consists of its portfolio of businesses serving clean water delivery, wastewater transport and treatment, and dewatering.

•Fourth quarter 2018 revenue was $609 million, up nine percent organically compared with fourth quarter 2017. This increase was driven by strong results in the Utility end market across all key geographies, including double-digit growth in the Emerging Markets. The Industrial end market was driven by healthy growth in the U.S., Latin America and Europe. 

•Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $119 million. Adjusted operating income for the segment, which excludes $7 million of restructuring and realignment and special charges, was $126 million, a 15-percent increase over the same period a year ago. Reported operating margin for the Water Infrastructure segment was 19.5 percent, up 130 basis points versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was up 180 basis points to 20.7 percent. Productivity gains, volume leverage and increased price realization more than offset inflation, negative currency impacts and investments.

Applied Water

Xylem’s Applied Water segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in residential and commercial building services, and industrial applications. 

•Fourth quarter 2018 Applied Water revenue was $402 million, a 10-percent increase organically year-over-year, driven by robust growth in the Commercial end market in the U.S., as well as China and India. The Company’s business in the Industrial end market also saw healthy growth from project business activity in the U.S.

•Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $66 million and adjusted operating income, which excludes $3 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $69 million, a 10-percent increase over the comparable period last year. The segment reported operating margin was 16.4 percent, up 30 basis points over the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 17.2 percent as continued traction from price, volume and cost reductions more than offset inflation, negative currency impacts and investments.

Measurement & Control Solutions

Xylem’s Measurement & Control Solutions segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in smart metering, network technologies, advanced infrastructure analytics and analytic instrumentation. 

•Fourth quarter 2018 Measurement & Control Solutions revenue was $375 million, up 11 percent organically versus the prior year, driven by double-digit growth in water in North America and Emerging Markets, as well as the continued deployment of large gas projects.

•Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $23 million, and adjusted operating income, which excludes $5 million of restructuring and realignment costs and special charges, was $28 million. Measurement & Control Solutions segment reported operating margin was 6.1 percent. Adjusted operating margin of 7.5% decreased 280 basis points over the prior year period, primarily due to higher inflation and adverse sales mix from component shortages, investments and purchase accounting.

Xylem Inc. Non-GAAP Measures

Management reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or "adjusted") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including but not limited to, dividends acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:

“Organic revenue" and "Organic orders” defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency translation impacts is determined by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate.

“Constant currency” defined as financial results adjusted for foreign currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

“EBITDA” defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. “Adjusted EBITDA” reflects the adjustment to EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation charges, restructuring and realignment costs, Sensus acquisition related costs, gain or loss from sale of businesses and special charges.

"Adjusted Operating Income", "Adjusted Segment Operating Income", "Adjusted Net Income" and “Adjusted EPS” defined as operating income, segment operating income, adjusted net income and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude restructuring and realignment costs, Sensus acquisition related costs, gain or loss from sale of businesses, special charges and tax-related special items, as applicable.

“Free Cash Flow” defined as net cash from operating activities, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flow, less capital expenditures as well as adjustments for other significant items that impact current results which management believes are not related to our ongoing operations and performance. Our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain non-discretionary cash payments, such as debt. 

“Realignment costs” defined as costs not included in restructuring costs that are incurred as part of actions taken to reposition our business, including items such as professional fees, severance, relocation, travel, facility set-up and other costs. 

“Sensus Acquisition Related Costs" defined as costs incurred by the Company associated with the acquisition of Sensus that are being reported within operating income. These costs include integration costs, acquisition costs, costs related to the recognition of the backlog intangible asset amortization recorded in purchase accounting.

“Special charges" defined as costs incurred by the Company, such as acquisition and integration related costs not included in "Sensus Acquisition Related Costs", non-cash impairment charges, due diligence costs and other special non-operating items.

“Tax-related special items" defined as tax items, such as tax return versus tax provision adjustments, tax exam impacts, tax law change impacts, significant reserves for cash repatriation, excess tax benefits/losses and other discrete tax adjustments.
