 On February 21, 2019, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Colgate-Palmolive Company (“Colgate”) elected Lisa M. Edwards, Executive Vice President, Strategic Business Operations, Customer and Partner Engagement of Salesforce.com, Inc. (“Salesforce”), to the Board of Directors effective March 1, 2019. Ms. Edwards, 51, will bring extensive leadership experience and expertise in information technology, e-commerce and digital transformation to Colgate’s Board. Ms. Edwards joined Salesforce in 2012 as Executive Vice President, Finance, Head of Global Corporate Services and Chief Procurement Officer, and has served in her current role since 2017. Ms. Edwards previously served in several senior management roles at Visa Inc., including as Senior Vice President and Head of Global Business Development and IP Strategy. Prior to that she was an entrepreneur after starting her career at Bain & Company. Ms. Edwards will receive compensation in accordance with Colgate’s director compensation program for non-employee directors.  

 During 2018, in the ordinary course of business Colgate purchased software licenses from Salesforce on arm’s length terms, totaling approximately $730,000. In accordance with Colgate’s Related Person Transaction Policy, these transactions were referred to and approved by the independent directors of the Board.  

 On February 21, 2019, Ellen M. Hancock, 75, advised the Board that she will not stand for reelection to the Board at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 10, 2019, in light of her desire to retire as a director at the end of her current term.  

 Additionally, Dennis J. Hickey, 70, Vice Chairman of Colgate, has advised Colgate of his decision to retire, effective February 28, 2019, after nearly 42 years of distinguished service with Colgate.
