Business Unit Summary

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the fourth quarter, Intel achieved revenue growth in nearly every business segment, and in 2018 every segment of the business set new annual all-time revenue records. 

The PC-centric business (CCG) was up 10 percent in the fourth quarter due to continued strong demand for Intel's higher performance products and strength in commercial and gaming. CCG expanded its product portfolio for 2019 with the recent launch of new 9th Gen Intel® Core™ processors and unveiled "Ice Lake" the upcoming, 10nm-based PC processor, which is expected to be in OEM systems on shelves for holiday, 2019.

Collectively, Intel's data-centric businesses grew 9 percent YoY in the quarter and 20 percent YoY in 2018. In the fourth quarter, DCG achieved 24 percent cloud segment growth and 12 percent communications service provider segment growth while enterprise revenue declined 5 percent. Intel recently announced that the new "Cascade Lake" family of high performance Intel® Xeon® processors with advanced AI and memory capabilities is now shipping.

Fourth-quarter Internet of Things Group (IOTG) revenue declined 7 percent YoY. However, excluding Wind River, which Intel divested in the second quarter, fourth-quarter IOTG revenue was up 4 percent YoY despite supply tightness. Record quarterly revenue in Intel's memory business (NSG) was up 25 percent YoY. Intel's Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) also achieved record quarterly revenue, up 8 percent YoY driven by strength in the data center and communications market segments. 

Mobileye fourth-quarter revenue of $183 million was up 43 percent YoY as customer momentum continued. In 2018, Mobileye achieved 28 new design wins and 78 vehicle model launches.

Additional information regarding Intel’s results can be found in the Q4'18 Earnings Presentation available at: www.intc.com/results.cfm.

Forward-Looking Statements

Intel’s Business Outlook and other statements in this release that refer to future plans and expectations are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "goals," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "continues," "may," "will," "would," "should," "could," and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Statements that refer to or are based on estimates, forecasts, projections, uncertain events or assumptions, including statements relating to total addressable market (TAM) or market opportunity, future products and the expected availability and benefits of such products, and anticipated trends in our businesses or the markets relevant to them, also identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this release are based on management's expectations as of the date of this release and, except as required by law, Intel disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Intel presently considers the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's expectations. 

•Demand for Intel's products is highly variable and could differ from expectations due to factors including changes in business and economic conditions; customer confidence or income levels, and the levels of customer capital spending; the introduction, availability and market acceptance of Intel's products, products used together with Intel products, and competitors' products; competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors; supply constraints and other disruptions affecting customers; changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations; changes in customer needs and emerging technology trends; and changes in the level of inventory at customers. 

•Intel's results could vary significantly from expectations based on capacity utilization; variations in inventory valuation, including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale; changes in revenue levels; segment product mix; the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs; excess or obsolete inventory; changes in unit costs; defects or disruptions in the supply of materials or resources; and product manufacturing quality/yields. Variations in results may also be caused by the timing of Intel product introductions and related expenses, including marketing programs, and Intel's ability to respond quickly to technological developments and to introduce new products or incorporate new features into existing products, which may result in restructuring and asset impairment charges.

•Intel's results could be affected by adverse economic, social, political and physical/infrastructure conditions in countries where Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including recession or slowing growth, military conflict and other security risks, natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, sanctions and tariffs, and continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union. Results may also be affected by the formal or informal imposition by countries of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, which could be changed without prior notice. 

•Intel operates in highly competitive industries and its operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. In addition, in connection with our strategic transformation to a data-centric company, we have entered new areas and introduced adjacent products, where we face new sources of competition and uncertain market demand or acceptance of our products, and these new areas and products may not grow as projected.

•The amount, timing and execution of Intel's stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on Intel's priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business, including operational and capital spending, acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash flows, tax laws, or the market price of our common stock. 

•Intel's expected tax rate is based on current tax law, including current interpretations of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (”TCJA”), and current expected income and may be affected by evolving interpretations of TCJA; changes in the volume and mix of profits earned across jurisdictions with varying tax rates; changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, including payment of interest and penalties; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. 

Intel/Page 5

•Intel's results could be affected by gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other, which could vary depending on gains or losses on the change in fair value, sale, exchange, or impairments of equity and debt investments, interest rates, cash balances, and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.  

•Product defects or errata (deviations from published specifications) may adversely impact our expenses, revenues and reputation. 

•We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products as well as the operating systems and workloads running on them. Security vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material, including incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, a reduction in the competitiveness of our products, defending against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. A detailed description of these risks is set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

•Intel's results could be affected by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust, commercial, disclosure and other issues. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting Intel from manufacturing or selling one or more products, precluding particular business practices, impacting Intel's ability to design its products, or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property. 

•Intel's results may be affected by the timing of closing of acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions.

Detailed information regarding these and other factors that could affect Intel's business and results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including the company's most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, particularly the "Risk Factors" sections of those reports. Copies of these filings may be obtained by visiting our Investor Relations website at www.intc.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. 

Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment. We also provide a non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow, as described below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. 

Acquisition-related adjustments: 

•Inventory valuation adjustments: Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired company’s cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin. The non-GAAP adjustments to our cost of sales exclude the expected profit margin component that is recorded under business combination accounting principles associated with our acquisition of Mobileye. We believe the adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect cost of sales and gross margin trends of our business.

•Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. We record charges related to the amortization of these intangibles within both cost of sales and operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.

•Other acquisition-related charges: Other acquisition-related charges exclude the impact of other charges associated with the acquisition of Mobileye. These charges primarily include bankers' fees, compensation-related costs, and valuation charges for stock-based compensation incurred related to the acquisition. We believe these adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect the spending trends of our business. 

Restructuring and other charges: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include asset impairments, pension charges, and costs associated with the ISecG divestiture. We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these costs do not reflect our current operating performance. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.  

Ongoing mark-to-market on marketable equity securities: We exclude gains and losses resulting from ongoing mark-to-market adjustments of our marketable equity securities, after the initial mark-to-market adjustment is recorded upon a security becoming marketable, when calculating certain non-GAAP measures, as we do not believe this volatility correlates to our core operational performance. Consequently, our non-GAAP earnings per share figures exclude these impacts to facilitate an evaluation of our current performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.

Gains or losses from divestitures: We divested ISecG in Q2 2017 and Wind River in Q2 2018. We exclude gains or losses and related tax impacts resulting from divestitures when calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.

Tax Reform adjustment: We recognized a higher income tax expense in Q4 2017 as a result of Tax Reform and have made adjustments to the original estimate in 2018. We exclude the Q4 2017 provisional tax estimate and 2018 provisional tax adjustments relating to the transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings and the remeasurement of our deferred income taxes to the new U.S. statutory tax rate for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe making this adjustment facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.

Free cash flow: We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow, which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is helpful to investors in understanding our capital requirements and provides an additional means to reflect the cash flow trends of our business.
