Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure

LabCorp® (NYSE: LH), a leading global life sciences company that is deeply integrated in guiding patient care, today announced a new assay in its therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) DoseASSURE® portfolio. The new Certolizumab Concentration and Anti-Certolizumab Antibody DoseASSURE™ CTZ assay, helps physicians monitor individual drug response for patients who are on Certolizumab, a biologic drug used to treat certain inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. 

Biologic drugs are complex, protein-based therapies that can be used to treat certain inflammatory diseases and are among the fastest growing class of drugs available today. However, the expense of these medications and the variability in patient response can present numerous challenges. LabCorp’s DoseASSURE® portfolio helps address these challenges by providing quantitative, patient-specific measurement which can guide patient therapy. With the launch of the DoseASSURE CTZ, LabCorp now has the most comprehensive biologics TDM menu in the industry, targeting the largest number of biologic drugs.
