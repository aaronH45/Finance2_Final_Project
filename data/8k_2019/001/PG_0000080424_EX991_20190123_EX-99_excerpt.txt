P&G ANNOUNCES FISCAL YEAR 2019 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

Net Sales in-line vs. YA; Organic Sales +4%; 

Diluted Net EPS $1.22, +31%; Core EPS $1.25, +5%; Currency-Neutral Core EPS +13%

CINCINNATI, January 23, 2019 - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported second quarter fiscal year 2019 net sales of $17.4 billion, even with the prior year level. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales increased four percent. Diluted net earnings per share were $1.22, an increase of 31% versus the prior year primarily due to the income tax charges related to transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act in the base period. Core earnings per share increased five percent to $1.25. Currency-neutral core EPS increased 13% versus the prior year.

Operating cash flow was $4.0 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow productivity was 103%. The Company returned $2.6 billion of cash to shareholders via nearly $1.9 billion of dividend payments and $0.8 billion of common stock repurchases.

“We delivered strong organic sales in the second quarter, building on our first quarter momentum, which enables us to increase our outlook for the year,” said David Taylor, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our focus on superiority, productivity and improving P&G’s organization and culture is delivering improved results despite a challenging competitive and macroeconomic environment.”

October - December Quarter Discussion

Net sales in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $17.4 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. Unfavorable foreign exchange was a four percent hurt to sales for the quarter. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales increased four percent driven by a two percent increase in shipment volume. Pricing was a one percent help to organic sales. Positive mix impact was a one percent help to organic sales due to the disproportionate growth of the premium Skin Care category behind the SK-II brand and strong growth in developed markets.

(1) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.

•Beauty segment organic sales increased eight percent versus year ago. Skin and Personal Care organic sales increased double digits due to premium innovation, positive product mix from the disproportionate growth of super-premium SK-II and Olay Skin Care brands and increased pricing. Hair Care organic sales increased low single digits primarily due to increased pricing. 

•Grooming segment organic sales decreased three percent. Shave Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines following devaluation-driven price increases, volatility in quarter to quarter merchandising events and heightened competitive activity. Appliances organic sales was unchanged.

•Health Care segment organic sales increased five percent. Oral Care organic sales increased mid-single digits due to premium innovation. Personal Health Care organic sales increased mid-single digits due to innovation and increased pricing. 

•Fabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased six percent for the quarter. Fabric Care organic sales increased high-single digits driven by innovation, increased pricing and positive mix due to the disproportionate growth of premium products. Home Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by innovation, increased merchandising activities and increased pricing.

•Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales was unchanged due to offsetting impacts. Increased pricing and positive mix due to the disproportionate growth of premium products were offset by competitive activity and volume reductions following increased pricing. Feminine Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by innovation and positive product mix due to the disproportionate growth of premium products. Family Care organic sales increased mid-single digits due to innovation, increased distribution and increased pricing, partially offset by negative mix due to disproportionate growth of large sizes.

Diluted net earnings per share were $1.22, an increase of 31% versus the prior year, primarily due to base period income tax charges related to the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act. Core earnings per share were $1.25, an increase of five percent versus the prior year driven primarily by a lower tax rate due to implementation of the U.S. Tax Act and a reduction in shares outstanding. Currency-neutral core earnings per share increased 13% for the quarter.

Reported gross margin decreased 100 basis points, including a 20 basis point impact from higher non-core restructuring charges versus the prior year. Core gross margin decreased 80 basis points, including 60 basis points of negative foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core gross margin decreased 20 basis points, as 150 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of pricing help were more than offset by 90 basis points of commodity cost increases, 30 basis points of innovation reinvestments and 100 basis points of unfavorable product mix and other impacts.

Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales decreased 90 basis points on a reported basis versus the prior year, including a 10 basis point help from a year-on-year decrease in non-core restructuring charges. Core SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 80 basis points versus the prior year, including approximately 20 basis points of negative foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 100 basis points driven by 60 basis points of net savings from overhead, media, agency fee and advertising production cost productivity and 110 basis points of sales leverage, partially offset by 70 basis points of reinvestments and other impacts.

Operating profit margin decreased approximately 20 basis points versus the base period on a reported basis including a 10 basis point hurt from higher non-core restructuring charges. Core operating margin decreased 10 basis points including approximately 90 basis points of negative foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core operating margin increased 80 basis points including total productivity cost savings of 210 basis points for the quarter.

Fiscal Year 2019 Guidance

The Company is increasing the high end of its guidance for organic sales growth by one percent. Organic sales growth is now estimated in the range of two to four percent for fiscal 2019. The Company now estimates fiscal 2019 all-in sales growth in the range of down one percent to up one percent versus the prior fiscal year, which includes a headwind of three to four percentage points to sales growth from foreign exchange. The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures should have a modest positive impact on all-in sales growth.

The Company also maintained its expectation for core earnings per share growth of three to eight percent versus fiscal 2018 Core EPS of $4.22. This outlook includes an estimated $1.4 billion headwind from foreign exchange and higher commodity and transportation costs. On an all-in GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share are expected to increase seventeen to twenty-four percent versus the prior year.

The Company now expects to exceed its target of 90% adjusted free cash flow productivity for fiscal 2019. P&G expects to pay over $7 billion in dividends and repurchase up to $5 billion of common shares.

Exhibit 1: Non-GAAP Measures

In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in Procter & Gamble's January 23, 2019 earnings release and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.

The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:

Incremental Restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that included incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. 

Transitional Impact of U.S. Tax Reform: As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017. This resulted in a net charge of $628 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $3.8 billion and a net deferred tax benefit of $3.2 billion. The adjustment to core earnings only includes this transitional impact. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings.

We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. The impact of the adoption of the new accounting standard for Revenue from Contracts with Customers is driven by the prospective reclassification of certain customer spending from marketing (SG&A) expense to a reduction of Net sales. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.

Core operating profit margin: Core operating profit margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time.

Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time.

Core selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of net sales: Core SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time.

Core effective tax rate: Core effective tax rate is a measure of the Company's effective tax rate adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.

Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance over time. These measures are also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

Free cash flow: Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. Free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and 

asset expansion. Management views free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.

Free cash flow productivity: Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Management views free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G's ability to generate cash. Free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.
