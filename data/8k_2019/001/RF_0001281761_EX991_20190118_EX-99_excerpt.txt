FOURTH QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS:

Selected items impacting earnings from continuing operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Based on income taxes at an approximate 25% incremental rate beginning in 2018, and 38.5% for all prior periods. Tax rates associated with leveraged lease terminations are incrementally higher based on their structure.

Regions continues to focus on increasing organizational efficiency and effectiveness. Recent actions include streamlining its structure and refining its branch network while making investments in new technologies, delivery channels and other drivers of growth. The company incurred $7 million of severance expense during the fourth quarter, as well as $3 million of expenses associated with branch consolidation, property and equipment charges.

Total revenue from continuing operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not Meaningful

* Changes in corporate income tax rates effective in 2018 resulted in a decrease to the taxable equivalent adjustment.

** These market value adjustments relate to assets held for employee benefits that are offset within salaries and employee benefits expense.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2018 to third quarter 2018

Total revenue of approximately $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter decreased approximately 2 percent on a reported basis and 1 percent on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the prior quarter. 

Net interest income and other financing income increased $16 million or 2 percent over the prior quarter and net interest margin rose 5 basis points to 3.55 percent. Net interest margin and net interest income and other financing income benefited from higher interest rates partially offset by higher funding costs. Net interest income and other financing income also benefited from higher average loan balances.

6

Non-interest income decreased $38 million or 7 percent on a reported basis, and $34 million or 7 percent on an adjusted basis(1), as increases in service charges and capital markets income were offset by decreases in market value adjustments on employee benefit assets, bank-owned life insurance, mortgage and other non-interest income. 

Capital markets income increased 11 percent primarily attributable to higher loan syndication income, fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers, and merger and acquisition advisory services partially offset by lower customer interest rate swap income. Swap income declined approximately $6 million due to negative market value adjustments at year-end. 

Market volatility in the fourth quarter also drove significant valuation declines in assets held for employee benefits and negatively impacted bank-owned life insurance income. Market value adjustments on total employee benefit assets decreased $22 million, and bank-owned life insurance income decreased $6 million.

Mortgage income decreased 6 percent primarily due to seasonally lower production and sales revenue, partially offset by higher hedging and valuation adjustments on residential mortgage servicing rights and an increase in servicing income. During the quarter, the company also completed the purchase of rights to service approximately $2.7 billion of additional residential mortgage loans. 

The decrease in other non-interest income was attributable primarily to a net $3 million decline in the value of certain equity investments in the fourth quarter compared to a net $8 million increase in the third quarter. In addition, $4 million of third quarter leveraged lease termination gains did not repeat.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017

Total revenue increased 2 percent on a reported and adjusted basis(1) compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Net interest income and other financing income increased 6 percent, and net interest margin increased 18 basis points. On an adjusted basis(1), net interest income and other financing income increased 6 percent and net interest margin increased 16 basis points. Net interest margin and net interest income and other financing income benefited primarily from higher interest rates partially offset by higher funding costs, as well as a mix shift within the consumer loan portfolio into higher yielding products. Net interest income and other financing income also benefited from higher average loan balances. 

Non-interest income decreased 7 percent on a reported basis and 5 percent on an adjusted basis(1) as growth in service charges, card and ATM fees, and wealth management income was offset by decreases in market value 

7

adjustments on employee benefit assets, capital markets, mortgage, bank-owned life insurance and other non-interest income. 

Service charges income increased 8 percent reflecting continued customer account growth, and card and ATM fees increased 5 percent primarily due to higher interchange revenue associated with increased transactions and new account growth. Wealth management income increased 5 percent led by growth in investment services income. 

Market volatility in the current quarter drove significant valuation declines in assets held for employee benefits and negatively impacted bank-owned life insurance income. Market value adjustments on total employee benefit assets decreased $21 million, and bank-owned life insurance income decreased $8 million.

Capital markets income decreased 11 percent reflecting lower merger and acquisition advisory services, fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers, and customer interest rate swap income. Mortgage income decreased 17 percent attributable primarily to lower secondary marketing gains and lower production.

Non-interest expense from continuing operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not Meaningful

Comparison of fourth quarter 2018 to third quarter 2018

Non-interest expense decreased 7 percent compared to the third quarter due primarily to a $60 million contribution to the Regions Financial Corporation Foundation during the prior quarter reflected in other non-interest expense. On an adjusted basis(1), non-interest expense decreased 1 percent primarily due to a reduction in salaries and benefits, professional fees, and FDIC insurance assessments. These reductions were partially offset by increases in occupancy expense. 

Salaries and benefits decreased 1 percent reflecting the benefit of staffing reductions. This decline was partially offset by one additional workday in the fourth quarter and an increase in incentive-based compensation. Professional fees decreased 16 percent attributable to lower legal fees, and FDIC insurance assessments decreased 36 percent reflecting the discontinuation of the FDIC's surcharge. Occupancy expense increased 5 percent attributable to storm-related charges associated with Hurricane Michael.

9

The company's reported fourth quarter efficiency ratio was 58.7 percent and 58.1 percent on an adjusted basis(1). The fourth quarter effective tax rate was approximately 17 percent reflecting beneficial adjustments for certain state tax matters and retrospective tax accounting method changes finalized in the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 20 percent for the full-year 2018.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017

Non-interest expense decreased 7 percent compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year primarily due to a $40 million contribution to the Regions Financial Corporation Foundation during the prior year reflected in other non-interest expense. On an adjusted basis(1), non-interest expense decreased 3 percent primarily due to lower salaries and benefits, FDIC insurance, and Visa class B shares expense, partially offset by increases in occupancy, professional fees, and provision for unfunded credit losses. 

Salaries and benefits decreased 2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year, and 3 percent excluding the impact of severance charges, reflecting the impact of staffing reductions. This decline was partially offset by one additional workday in the current year quarter and an increase in incentive-based compensation. Staffing levels declined by 1,045 full-time equivalent positions or 5 percent from the fourth quarter of the prior year.

Loans and Leases

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not meaningful.

* 2018 average residential first mortgage balances include the impact of a $254 million loan sale during the first quarter of 2018. 

Comparison of fourth quarter 2018 to third quarter 2018

Average loans and leases increased 1 percent to $81.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Adjusted(1) average loans and leases increased 1 percent reflecting broad-based growth across the business and consumer lending portfolios.

Average balances in the business lending portfolio increased 2 percent. Growth in commercial and industrial loans was broad-based across the corporate and middle market portfolios, driven by specialized lending, government and institutional banking, and real-estate investment trust portfolios. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans decreased modestly, while investor real estate loans increased 3 percent driven by growth in term lending primarily within the office and industrial property types.

Adjusted(1) average consumer loans increased 1 percent with growth led by a 12 percent increase in indirect-other consumer, a 2 percent increase in consumer credit card, and a modest increase in residential first mortgage loans partially offset by a 2 percent decline in home equity lending. 

Comparison of fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017

Average loans and leases increased 3 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and adjusted(1) average loans increased 4 percent. 

11

Average balances in the business lending portfolio increased 5 percent as growth in commercial and industrial loans was partially offset by a decline in owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. Investor real estate loans increased 3 percent driven primarily by growth in term lending.

Adjusted(1) average consumer balances increased 3 percent as growth in indirect-other consumer, residential first mortgage, indirect-vehicle, consumer credit card, and other consumer loans was partially offset by declines in home equity lending. 

Deposits 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Comparison of fourth quarter 2018 to third quarter 2018

Total average deposit balances decreased less than 1 percent to $93.2 billion in the fourth quarter. 

Average deposits in the Consumer segment decreased $318 million or 1 percent and Corporate segment average deposits decreased $240 million or 1 percent. Average deposits declined approximately 3 percent in the Wealth Management segment and included the impact of ongoing strategic reductions of certain collateralized deposits. Average deposits in the Other segment also decreased modestly. 

Comparison of fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017

Total average deposit balances decreased 4 percent from the prior year as growth in average Consumer segment deposits was offset by strategic reductions in Wealth Management and Other segment deposits. In addition, Corporate segment deposits decreased $2.0 billion or 7 percent primarily due to customers using liquidity to pay down debt or invest in their businesses.

Asset quality

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Excludes guaranteed residential first mortgages that are 90+ days past due and still accruing. 

** Business services represents the combined total of commercial and investor real estate loans.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2018 to third quarter 2018

Overall asset quality reflected seasonality during the fourth quarter. Total non-performing, criticized and troubled debt restructured loans all declined, while net charge-offs and delinquencies increased. Total non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased to 0.60 percent of loans outstanding, the lowest level since 2007. Business services criticized and total troubled debt restructured loans decreased 5 percent and 14 percent, respectively. 

Annualized net charge-offs increased 6 basis points to 0.46 percent of average loans. The provision for loan losses approximated net charge-offs, and the resulting allowance for loan and lease losses totaled 1.01 percent of total loans outstanding and 169 percent of total non-accrual loans. Delinquent loans 90 days or more past due also increased modestly. Overall asset quality remains within our stated risk appetite, and volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017

Annualized net charge-offs increased 15 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, while the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percent of total loans decreased 16 basis points. Total non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased 24 percent and total business services criticized loans decreased 22 percent, including a 32 percent decline in classified loans. In addition, total troubled debt restructured loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased 36 percent.

Capital and liquidity

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Under the Basel III capital rules, Regions’ estimated capital ratios remain well above current regulatory requirements.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

Management uses pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP) and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP), as well as the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio. Net interest income and other financing income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments related to tax reform to arrive at adjusted net interest income and other financing income (non-GAAP). Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the fee income ratio. Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) and adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP) are used to determine adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP). Net interest income and other financing income (GAAP) on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis is presented excluding certain adjustments related to tax reform to arrive at adjusted net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP).  Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.

Tangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it 

16

differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.

The calculation of the fully phased-in pro-forma "Common equity Tier 1" (CET1) is based on Regions’ understanding of the Final Basel III requirements. For Regions, the Basel III framework became effective on a phased-in approach starting in 2015 with full implementation beginning in 2019. The calculation includes estimated pro-forma amounts for the ratio on a fully phased-in basis. Regions’ current understanding of the final framework includes certain assumptions, including the Company’s interpretation of the requirements, and informal feedback received through the regulatory process. Regions’ understanding of the framework is evolving and will likely change as analysis and discussions with regulators continue. Because Regions is not currently subject to the fully-phased in capital rules, this pro-forma measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure, and other entities may calculate it differently from Regions’ disclosed calculation. 

A company's regulatory capital is often expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Under the risk-based capital framework, a company’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the prescribed risk-weighted percentage. The resulting weighted values from each of the categories are added together and this sum is the risk-weighted assets total that, as adjusted, comprises the denominator of certain risk-based capital ratios. CET1 capital is then divided by this denominator (risk-weighted assets) to determine the CET1 capital ratio. The amounts disclosed as risk-weighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements on a fully phased-in basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.

Management and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentation to investors of company performance
