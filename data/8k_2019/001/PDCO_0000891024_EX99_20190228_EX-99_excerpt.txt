St. Paul, Minn. — February 28, 2019 — Patterson Companies, Inc. (Nasdaq: PDCO) today reported consolidated net sales of approximately $1.4 billion (see attached Sales Summary for further details) in its fiscal third quarter ended January 26, 2019, an increase of 1.6 percent compared to the same period last year.

The prior year period included the recognition of a provisional tax benefit of $77.3 million, reflecting the revaluation of tax-deferred assets and liabilities, net of a one-time transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”) enacted during the prior year period. Adjusted net income1 attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., which excludes deal amortization costs, integration and business restructuring costs and discrete tax matters, totaled $35.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $39.6 million in the same quarter last year, or $0.43 per diluted share.  

“We are pleased with our performance during the third quarter. We delivered the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth as well as continued, sequential operating margin improvement,” said Mark Walchirk, President and CEO of Patterson Companies. “We continued to execute against our strategic priorities, which resulted in Dental segment revenue growth and solid performance in our Animal Health segment. Our progress throughout fiscal 2019 provides us with confidence that we are taking the right steps to build a stronger Patterson that is well positioned to deliver long-term value.”

Reported net sales in our Animal Health segment for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, which comprised approximately 58 percent of the company’s total sales, were $807.5 million compared to $794.9 million in the same quarter last year. Internal sales for the segment increased 2.8 percent from the fiscal 2018 third quarter.

   •    

GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.94 per diluted share.  

   •    

Non-GAAP adjusted earnings1 are expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.45 per diluted share.

1Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

The Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Measures table appearing behind the accompanying financial information is provided to adjust reported GAAP measures, namely operating income, income before taxes, income tax expense, net income, net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., for the impact of deal amortization, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserve costs and discrete tax matters, along with the related tax effects of these items.  

Management believes that these non-GAAP measures may provide a helpful representation of the company’s third-quarter performance and earnings guidance, and enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures.  

In addition, the term “internal sales” used in this release represents net sales adjusted to exclude foreign currency impact and changes in product selling relationships. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company uses to convert results for all foreign entities where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period’s currency exchange rates. The company believes the disclosure of net sales changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.
