Duke Energy reports fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results 

▪Full-year 2018 GAAP EPS of $3.76; adjusted EPS of $4.72 

▪Company achieves results above the midpoint of original 2018 guidance range

▪2019 adjusted EPS guidance range set at $4.80 to $5.20

▪Company extends long-term earnings growth expectation of 4 to 6 percent 

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today announced 2018 full-year reported diluted earnings per share (EPS), prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $3.76, compared to $4.36 for full-year 2017. Duke Energy's full-year 2018 adjusted diluted EPS was $4.72, compared to $4.57 for full-year 2017. 

Adjusted diluted EPS excludes the impact of certain items that are included in GAAP reported diluted EPS. The difference between 2018 GAAP reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS was primarily due to charges related to regulatory decisions, impairments and severance.

Higher full-year 2018 adjusted results were driven by favorable weather, higher retail sales volumes and the contribution of rate cases in North Carolina; partially offset by higher depreciation from a growing asset base, and a lower tax shield on holding company interest as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act).

“We closed out another successful year in 2018, with strong financial results, constructive regulatory outcomes and remarkable storm response,” said Lynn Good, Duke Energy chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Our electric, gas and commercial renewables franchises are producing significant value for customers and shareholders as we make important infrastructure investments for the future.

“Duke Energy remains committed to advancing our long-term strategy — modernizing the energy grid, generating cleaner energy and expanding natural gas infrastructure. We advanced these priorities in 2018, and today announced 2019 earnings guidance, representing 6 percent growth off of 2018 results. With our robust growth capital plan, ongoing stakeholder engagement efforts and cost management discipline, we remain confident in our growth potential for 2019 and beyond.”

The company has set its 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $5.20, and extended its long-term adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 4 to 6 percent through 2023. The growth rate

is based off the midpoint of the 2019 adjusted diluted guidance range, or $5.00 per share, and is supported by the company's $37 billion growth capital plan.

Quarterly results

Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2018 GAAP reported EPS was $0.65, compared to $1.00 for fourth quarter 2017. Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2018 adjusted diluted EPS was $0.84, compared to $0.94 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Lower adjusted results for the quarter compared to last year were driven by higher depreciation and amortization expense on a growing asset base, higher storm-related costs and a lower tax shield on holding company interest as a result of the Tax Act; partially offset by higher rider revenues. 

In addition to the following summary of fourth quarter 2018 business segment performance, comprehensive tables with detailed EPS drivers for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018 compared to prior year are provided in the tables at the end of this news release.

The discussion below of fourth quarter results includes both GAAP segment income and adjusted segment income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tables at the end of this news release present a full reconciliation of GAAP reported results to adjusted results. 

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure

On a reported basis, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2018 segment income of $566 million, compared to $826 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition to the drivers outlined below, fourth quarter 2018 results were impacted by a $46 million after-tax impairment charge related to the Citrus County facility. Fourth quarter 2017 results include a $231 million benefit related to the Tax Act. These amounts were treated as special items and excluded from adjusted earnings.

On an adjusted basis, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2018 adjusted segment income of $628 million, compared to $609 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.02 per share, excluding share dilution of $0.02 per share. 

Higher quarterly results at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure were primarily due to higher rider revenues (+$0.05 per share) and the contribution of rate cases in North Carolina (+$0.03 per share), partially offset by higher depreciation expense on a growing asset base (-$0.04 per share) and higher interest expense (-$0.02 per share).

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure

On a reported basis, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2018 segment income of $113 million, compared to $140 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 results include a $26 million benefit related to the Tax Act, which was treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted earnings. On an adjusted basis, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2018 segment income of $113 million, compared to $114 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Duke Energy News Release 3

Commercial Renewables

On a reported basis, Commercial Renewables recognized fourth quarter 2018 segment income of $13 million, compared to $439 million in the fourth quarter 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 results include a $442 million benefit related to the Tax Act, which was treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted earnings. On an adjusted basis, Commercial Renewables recognized fourth quarter 2018 segment income of $13 million, compared to $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Other

Other primarily includes interest expense on holding company debt, other unallocated corporate costs and results from Duke Energy’s captive insurance company.

On a reported basis, Other recognized a fourth quarter 2018 net loss of $248 million, compared to a net loss of $700 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition to the drivers outlined below, fourth quarter 2018 results were impacted by severance charges and the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the Tax Act. Fourth quarter 2017 results include a $597 million charge related to the Tax Act. These amounts were treated as special items and excluded from adjusted earnings.

On an adjusted basis, Other recognized a fourth quarter 2018 adjusted net loss of $149 million, compared to an adjusted net loss of $82 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a difference of $0.10 per share. Lower quarterly results at Other were primarily due to a lower tax shield on holding company interest as a result of the Tax Act (-$0.04 per share), higher claims at the captive insurer (-$0.03 per share) driven by storm losses and higher interest expense (-$0.02 per share). 

Effective Tax Rate

On a reported basis, Duke Energy's consolidated effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was (0.2) percent compared to 18.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2018 includes the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the Tax Act, which was treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted results. On an adjusted basis, the consolidated adjusted effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2018 was 16.1 percent, compared to 31.5 percent in 2017. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Act. Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tables at the end of this news release present a reconciliation of the reported effective tax rate to the adjusted effective tax rate.

Duke Energy News Release 5

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP financial measures

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted effective tax rate. Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS represent income from continuing operations attributable to Duke Energy, adjusted for the dollar and per-share impact of special items. The adjusted effective tax rate is calculated using pretax earnings and income tax expense, both as adjusted for the impact of special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. 

Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and the adjusted effective tax rate provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted effective tax rate are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP reported earnings), Diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP reported EPS), and the reported effective tax rate, respectively. 

Special items included in the periods presented include the following items, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:

•Costs to Achieve Piedmont Merger represents charges that result from the Piedmont acquisition.

Duke Energy News Release 6

•Regulatory and Legislative Impacts in 2018 represents charges related to the Duke Energy Progress (DEP) and Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) North Carolina rate case orders and the repeal of the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. In 2017, Regulatory Settlements represents charges related to the Levy nuclear project in Florida and the Mayo Zero Liquid Discharge and Sutton combustion turbine projects in North Carolina.

•Sale of Retired Plant represents the loss associated with selling Beckjord Generating Station (Beckjord), a nonregulated generating facility in Ohio.

•Impairment Charges in 2018 represents an asset impairment at the Citrus County Combined Cycle facility at Duke Energy Florida (Citrus County), a goodwill impairment at Commercial Renewables and an other-than-temporary impairment of an investment in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution). In 2017, Commercial Renewables Impairments represents goodwill and other-than-temporary asset impairments at Commercial Renewables.

•Impacts of the Tax Act represents amounts recognized related to the Tax Act.

•Severance represents charges related to company-wide initiatives, excluding merger integration, to standardize processes and systems, leverage technology and workforce optimization.

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted earnings guidance, information to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to project all special items for future periods (such as legal settlements, the impact of regulatory orders or asset impairments).

Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income and other net loss. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations attributable to Duke Energy. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Management also uses adjusted segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment performance. Adjusted segment income is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it is based upon segment income adjusted for special items, which are discussed above. Management believes the presentation of adjusted segment income provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment’s performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment income or adjusted other net loss is segment income and other net loss.

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted segment income or adjusted other net loss and any related growth rates for future periods, information to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not available at this time, as the company is unable to forecast all special items, as discussed above. 

Duke Energy News Release 7

Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted segment income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.
