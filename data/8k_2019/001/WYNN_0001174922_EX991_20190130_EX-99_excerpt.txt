Wynn Resorts, Limited Reports Fourth Quarter and Year End 2018 Results

LAS VEGAS, January 30, 2019 — Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN) ("the Company") today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018. The results reflect the Company’s adoption of the new revenue recognition standard ("ASC 606"), effective January 1, 2018. Certain prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of ASC 606, with no impact to operating income, net income or Adjusted Property EBITDA (1). 

Operating revenues were $1.69 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 4.0%, or $65.4 million, from $1.62 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating revenues from Wynn Palace and our Las Vegas Operations increased $84.0 million and $11.7 million, respectively, offset by a decrease of $30.3 million at Wynn Macau.

On a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis, net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was $476.6 million, or $4.41 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $491.7 million, or $4.77 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we finalized our analysis of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. tax reform”), which was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and further clarified by guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, fourth quarter 2018 results reflect a net tax benefit of $390.9 million related to U.S. tax reform, which is incremental to the $339.9 million provisional net tax benefit reflected in the fourth quarter of 2017 results.

Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited (2) was $114.0 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $144.3 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

In the fourth quarter of 2018, Adjusted Property EBITDA increased 4.0%, to $499.4 million, compared to $480.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted Property EBITDA from Wynn Palace and our Las Vegas Operations increased $36.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, offset by a decrease of $18.5 million from Wynn Macau.

In the full year of 2018, operating revenues increased 10.7%, or $647.5 million, to $6.72 billion, compared to $6.07 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating revenues increased $727.3 million at Wynn Palace, partially offset by decreases of $42.4 million and $37.4 million from Wynn Macau and our Las Vegas Operations, respectively. 

GAAP net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was $584.2 million, or $5.46 per diluted share in 2018, compared to $747.2 million, or $7.28 per diluted share in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by a litigation settlement expense of $463.6 million recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Both full year 2018 and 2017 results included the aforementioned net tax benefits of $390.9 million and $339.9 million, respectively, recorded in connection with U.S. tax reform.

Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was $699.5 million, or $6.54 per diluted share, in 2018, compared to $560.5 million, or $5.46 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2017. 

Full year Adjusted Property EBITDA increased 12.9%, or $233.7 million, to $2.04 billion, compared to $1.81 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted Property EBITDA increased $316.3 million at Wynn Palace, partially offset by decreases of $27.5 million and $55.1 million, from Wynn Macau and our Las Vegas Operations, respectively. 

Wynn Resorts, Limited also announced today that the Company has approved a cash dividend of $0.75 per share, payable on February 26, 2019 to stockholders of record as of February 15, 2019. 

In the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 1,478,552 shares of its common stock for approximately $156.7 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(1) “Adjusted Property EBITDA” is net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, litigation settlement expense, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, (loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, change in derivatives fair value, change in Redemption Note fair value and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted Property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. The Company also presents Adjusted Property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company’s ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company’s performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted Property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDA. Also, Wynn Resorts’ calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

(2) “Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited” is net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited before litigation settlement expense, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, change in derivatives fair value, change in Redemption Note fair value, (loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, foreign currency remeasurement loss, the impact from the enactment of U.S. tax reform, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes calculated using the specific tax treatment applicable to the adjustments based on their respective jurisdictions. Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share are presented as supplemental disclosures to financial measures in accordance with GAAP because management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/or evaluated by some investors, in addition to net income and earnings per share computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 

The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited, (ii) operating income to Adjusted Property EBITDA, and (iii) net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to Adjusted Property EBITDA.
