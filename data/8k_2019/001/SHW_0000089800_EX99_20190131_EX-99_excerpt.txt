CLEVELAND, OHIO, January 31, 2019 - The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) announced its financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018. Compared to the same periods in 2017, full year consolidated net sales increased $2.55 billion, or 17.0%, to $17.53 billion due primarily to incremental Valspar sales from the five months ended May 2018, higher paint sales volume in The Americas Group and selling price increases. Incremental Valspar sales from the five months ended May 2018 increased net sales 12.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Consolidated net sales in the quarter increased $84.7 million, or 2.1%, to $4.06 billion primarily due to higher paint sales volume in The Americas Group and selling price increases. As a result of the new revenue standard (ASC 606) adopted in the first quarter of 2018, certain advertising support that was previously classified as selling, general and administrative expenses is now classified as a reduction of revenue with no effect on net income. The new revenue standard decreased consolidated net sales less than 1% in the year and quarter.  

Diluted net income per share in the year decreased to $11.67 per share from $18.20 per share for 2017. Full year 2018 diluted net income per share included per share charges for acquisition-related costs of $4.15 and other non-operating expenses totaling $2.71. Other non-operating expenses included environmental provisions of $1.32, California litigation expense of $1.09 and pension plan settlement expense of $.30 per share, respectively. Currency translation rate changes decreased diluted net income per share in the year by $.21 per share. Full year 2017 diluted net income per share included a one-time benefit of $7.04 per share from deferred income tax reductions, a one-time charge of $.44 per share for discontinued operations and a charge of $3.47 per share for acquisition-related costs.  

During the second and fourth quarters of 2018, the Company reached a series of agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency for remediation plans with cost estimates at one of the Company’s four major sites which required significant environmental provisions be recorded during those quarters. The California litigation charge was recorded in the third quarter 2018. The pension plan settlement expense recorded in the fourth quarter 2018 was a result of elected  

 lump sum cash payouts to defined benefit plan participants. The Company is in the process of settling the majority of its overfunded domestic defined benefit plan liabilities through either lump sum cash payouts to plan participants or annuity purchase expected to be made in early 2019. After the annuity purchase is completed, the Company will use the remaining surplus cash for funding future Company contributions to a replacement defined contribution pension plan.  

A voluntary inventory accounting change was made in the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by the Company’s integration activities (Accounting Change). As a result of the Accounting Change in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a retrospective one-time expense adjustment to cost of goods sold of $58.9 million, or $.47 per share has been made to revise 2017 fourth quarter and full year amounts. This revision increased acquisition-related costs and decreased previously reported segment profit for Performance Coatings and Consumer Brands Groups by $35.7 million and $23.2 million, respectively, for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017 amounts.  

Diluted net income per share decreased in the quarter to $1.07 per share from $8.92 per share for 2017. Diluted net income per share in the quarter included per share charges for acquisition-related costs of $1.10 and other non-operating expenses totaling $1.37 which included environmental provisions of $1.07 and pension plan settlement expense of $.30, respectively. Currency translation rate changes decreased diluted net income per share in the quarter by $.15 per share. Fourth quarter 2017 diluted net income per share included a one-time benefit of $7.00 per share from deferred income tax reductions and a charge of $1.24 per share for acquisition-related costs.  

Net sales in The Americas Group increased 5.6% to $9.63 billion in the year and increased 3.0% to $2.25 billion in the quarter due primarily to higher architectural paint sales volume across most end market segments and selling price increases. Net sales from stores in U.S. and Canada open for more than twelve calendar months increased 5.1% in the year and 2.9% in the quarter over last year’s comparable periods. Currency translation rate changes reduced full year and quarter sales by 1.0% and 1.8%, respectively. The Americas Group segment profit increased to $1.90 billion in the year from $1.77 billion last year and increased to $413.4 million in the quarter from $406.0 million last year due primarily to higher paint sales volume and selling price increases partially offset by increased raw material costs. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit 1.3% and 2.7% in the year and quarter, respectively. Segment profit as a percent to net sales increased in the year to 19.7% from 19.4% in 2017. Segment profit as a percent to net sales decreased in the quarter to 18.3% from 18.5% last year primarily due to slower architectural volume sales and increased raw material costs partially offset by selling price increases and good cost control.  

Net sales of the Consumer Brands Group increased 27.1% to $2.74 billion in the year due primarily to incremental Valspar sales, selling price increases and a new customer program, partially offset by lower volume sales to some of the Group’s retail customers and a newly adopted revenue recognition standard. Incremental Valspar sales from the five months ended May 2018 increased Group net sales 26.9% in the year. Net sales decreased 6.5% to $534.4 million in the quarter due primarily to lower volume sales to some of the Group’s retail customers and the new revenue standard, partially offset by a new customer program and selling price increases. The new revenue standard reduced Group net sales by 4.8% and 2.8% in the year and the quarter, respectively. Segment profit increased to $261.1 million in the year from $202.8 million last year due to incremental Valspar operations profit for the first five months of $75.8 million, increased selling prices and reduced impacts of the Accounting Change, partially offset by increased raw material costs and lower sales to some of the Group’s customers. As a percent to net external sales, segment profit increased in the year to 9.5% from 9.4% last year. In the year, purchase accounting costs decreased segment profit by $110.9 million compared to $107.6 million in 2017. In addition, the Accounting Change decreased segment profit by $23.2 million in the year 2017. Segment profit increased to $12.0 million in the quarter from $.4 million last year primarily due to reduced impacts of the Accounting Change, price increases and good cost control, partially offset by higher raw material costs and lower sales volumes to  

 most of the Group’s customers. Segment profit as a percent to sales increased in the quarter to 2.2% from 0.1% last year. In the quarter, purchase accounting costs decreased segment profit by $24.5 million compared to $32.8 million in 2017. In addition, the Accounting Change decreased segment profit by $23.2 million in the quarter 2017.  

The Performance Coatings Group’s net sales stated in U.S. dollars increased 39.4% to $5.17 billion in the year due primarily to incremental Valspar sales and selling price increases. Incremental Valspar sales from the five months ended May 2018 increased Group net sales 34.3% in the year. Net sales stated in U.S. dollars increased 4.6% to $1.27 billion in the quarter due primarily to selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes reduced quarter sales by 1.2%. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit increased in the year to $452.1 million from $262.8 million last year due to incremental Valspar operations profit for the first five months of $97.6 million, selling price increases, and reduced impacts of the Accounting Change, partially offset by higher raw material costs and increased purchase accounting impacts. Currency rate translations decreased segment profit by 1.7% in the year. As a percent to net external sales, segment profit increased in the year to 8.8% from 7.1% last year. In the year, purchase accounting costs decreased segment profit $215.8 million compared to $183.1 million in 2017. In addition, the Accounting Change decreased segment profit by $35.7 million in the year 2017. Segment profit increased in the quarter to $112.3 million from $83.7 million last year due primarily to reduced impacts of the Accounting Change and price increases, partially offset by higher raw material costs and increased purchase accounting impacts. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit 3.9% in the quarter. As a percent to net external sales, segment profit increased in the quarter to 8.8% from 6.9% last year. In the quarter, purchase accounting costs decreased segment profit $55.2 million compared to $42.1 million in 2017. In addition, the Accounting Change decreased segment profit by $35.7 million in the quarter 2017.  

The Company purchased 1,525,000 shares of its common stock in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 10.13 million shares of its common stock through open market purchases.  

Commenting on the financial results, John G. Morikis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said “Sherwin-Williams delivered record results in 2018 despite a fourth quarter that was below our expectations. Consolidated sales for the year grew at a mid-single digit rate excluding the five months of Valspar incremental sales, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by approximately 23 percent. In all business segments, we continued to focus on innovative products and services to help our customers improve their productivity and profitability. We also implemented price increases during the year to combat persistent raw material inflation. In addition, our team made significant progress on our acquisition integration efforts, with the resulting benefits exceeding our target for the year. We also generated record cash from operations in 2018, enabling us to invest in growth initiatives, increase our dividend, purchase shares of stock and significantly reduce debt.  

“We enter 2019 well-positioned and focused on what we can control. While the current macroeconomic outlook is less than clear, we see significant opportunities for profitable growth throughout the business. In The Americas Group, we will continue to invest in our store model and best-in-class products while executing on share of wallet and new account activation initiatives. In the Consumer Brands Group, we are excited by the exclusive national partnership and shared commitment to growth we have with our largest retail partner, as well as by our strong relationships with other leading retailers. Finally, in the Performance Coatings Group, we are focused on leveraging the combined capabilities of our integrated organization across the various end markets and geographies we serve.  

“In the first quarter of 2019, we anticipate our net sales will increase two to six percent compared to the first quarter of 2018. The first quarter 2019 will include the expenses related to the defined benefit plan annuity purchase of approximately $.43 per share. For the full year 2019, we expect core net sales to increase four to seven percent compared to full year 2018. With annual sales at that level, we anticipate diluted net income per share for 2019 will be in the range  

 of $16.77 to $17.77 per share compared to $11.67 per share earned in 2018. Full year 2019 earnings per share includes acquisition-related costs and other non-operating expenses of approximately $3.20 and $.43 per share, respectively. We expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be in the low twenty percent range.”

Regulation G Reconciliation  

Management of the Company believes that investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of diluted net income per share excluding Valspar acquisition-related costs and other non-operating expenses. This adjusted earnings per share measurement is not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It should not be considered a substitute for earnings per share computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following tables reconcile diluted net income per share computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to adjusted diluted net income per share.
