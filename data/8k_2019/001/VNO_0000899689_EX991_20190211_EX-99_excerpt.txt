Fourth Quarter Activity:

Acquisition:

Farley Office and Retail Building 

On October 30, 2018, we increased our ownership interest in the joint venture that is developing the Farley Office and Retail Building to 95.0% from 50.1% by acquiring a 44.9% additional ownership interest from the Related Companies ("Related"). The purchase price was $41,500,000 plus the reimbursement of $33,026,000 of costs funded by Related through October 30, 2018. We consolidate the accounts of the joint venture as of October 30, 2018. In connection therewith, we recorded a net gain of $44,060,000, which is included in "purchase price fair value adjustment" on our consolidated statements of income. As a result of this gain, because we hold our investment in the joint venture through a taxable REIT subsidiary, $16,771,000 of income tax expense was recognized on our consolidated statements of income.

Financing:

On October 26, 2018, we extended our $750,000,000 unsecured term loan from October 2020 to February 2024. The interest rate on the extended unsecured term loan was lowered from LIBOR plus 1.15% to LIBOR plus 1.00% (3.52% as of December 31, 2018). In connection with the extension of our unsecured term loan, we entered into an interest rate swap from LIBOR plus 1.00% to a fixed rate of 3.87% through October 2023. 

On November 16, 2018, we completed a $205,000,000 refinancing of 150 West 34th Street, a 78,000 square foot Manhattan retail property. The interest-only loan carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.88% (4.26% as of December 31, 2018) and matures in 2024, as extended. Concurrently, we invested $105,000,000 in a participation in the refinanced mortgage loan, which earns interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00% (4.38% as of December 31, 2018) and also matures in 2024, as extended, and is included in "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets. The property was previously encumbered by a mortgage of the same amount at LIBOR plus 2.25%, which was scheduled to mature in 2020.

Other:

220 Central Park South ("220 CPS")

During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of 11 condominium units at 220 CPS for net proceeds aggregating $214,776,000 and resulting in a financial statement net gain of $81,224,000 which is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income. In connection with these sales, $13,888,000 of income tax expense was recognized in our consolidated statements of income and $213,000,000 of the $950,000,000 220 CPS loan was repaid.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS

The following table reconciles net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of our net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions is provided above. In addition to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, we also disclose FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance. Reconciliations of FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted are provided on page 3 of this press release.

In accordance with the NAREIT December 2018 restated definition of FFO, we have elected to exclude the mark-to-market adjustments of marketable equity securities from the calculation of FFO. Our FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 has been adjusted to exclude the $26,602,000, or $0.13 per share, decrease in fair value of marketable equity securities previously reported.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS - CONTINUED

Below is a reconciliation of net income to NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the three months ended September 30, 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NOI represents total revenues less operating expenses. We consider NOI to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI should not be considered a substitute for net income. NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2)The three months ended December 31, 2018 includes an additional $12,814 real estate tax expense accrual due to an increase in the tax-assessed value of theMART. 

Same store NOI at share represents NOI at share from property operations which are owned by us and in service in both the current and prior year reporting periods. Same store NOI at share - cash basis is NOI at share from operations before straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments which are owned by us and in service in both the current and prior year reporting periods. We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. Same store NOI at share and same store NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
