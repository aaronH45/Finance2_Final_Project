  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

CEO Commentary  

“Our fourth quarter and full year results were very strong. In 2018, we produced record results, generated profitable relationship growth, benefited from our improved balance sheet resiliency, and diligently managed our expenses while continuing to invest for future growth. We returned $2 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, including a nearly 40% increase in the dividend by the end of the year, while maintaining very strong capital ratios.”  

“We recently received the regulatory non-objection related to our re-submitted capital plan, including the pro forma impact of MB Financial. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the expected financial synergies from the pending acquisition, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2019.”  

“With the conclusion of Project NorthStar at the end of 2019, the ongoing MB Financial integration efforts, and a clearly-defined set of strategic priorities for the future, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets and outperform through the cycle.”

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Compared to the year-ago quarter, NII increased $122 million, or 13 percent, which was impacted by a $27 million remeasurement related to the tax treatment of leveraged leases in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the remeasurement, NII increased $95 million, or 10 percent, reflecting higher short-term market rates and growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase in funding costs. NIM increased 27 bps, which included an 8 bps impact from the remeasurement in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the remeasurement, NIM increased 19 bps, reflecting higher short-term market rates and growth in interest-earning assets.  

Compared to the prior quarter, NII increased $38 million, or 4 percent, reflecting growth in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, securities portfolio balance growth, and higher short-term market rates. NIM increased 6 bps, primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and growth in C&I loans.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reported noninterest income was flat from the year-ago quarter, and increased $12 million, or 2 percent, from the prior quarter. The comparisons reflect the impact of certain significant items in the table on page 4.  

3   

Compared to the year-ago quarter, service charges on deposits decreased $3 million, or 2 percent. Corporate banking revenue increased $53 million, or 69 percent, which was impacted by a $25 million lease remarketing impairment in the year-ago quarter. Excluding this impact, corporate banking revenue increased $28 million, or 27 percent, primarily driven by strong capital markets revenue led by record M&A advisory fees as well as increased syndication revenues. Mortgage banking net revenue was flat primarily driven by lower negative net valuation adjustments and higher gross mortgage servicing fees, partially offset by lower origination fees and gains on loan sales. Mortgage originations of $1.6 billion decreased 18 percent. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $3 million, or 3 percent, primarily driven by higher personal asset management revenue reflecting positive net inflows. Card and processing revenue increased $4 million, or 5 percent, reflecting increases in credit card spend and debit transaction volumes, partially offset by higher rewards.  

Compared to the prior quarter, service charges on deposits decreased $4 million, or 3 percent. Corporate banking revenue increased $30 million, or 30 percent, primarily driven by increases in M&A advisory and syndication revenues. Mortgage banking net revenue increased $5 million, or 10 percent, primarily driven by lower negative net valuation adjustments partially offset by lower origination fees and gains on loan sales. Mortgage originations decreased 16 percent. Wealth and asset management revenue decreased $5 million, or 4 percent, primarily driven by lower institutional trust and brokerage fees. Card and processing revenue increased $2 million, or 2 percent, reflecting increases in credit card spend volumes, partially offset by higher rewards.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Compared to the year-ago quarter, noninterest income excluding the items in the table above increased $13 million, or 2 percent. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest income excluding these items increased $14 million, or 2 percent.  

Other noninterest income on a reported basis in the current and previous quarters was impacted by the Visa total return swap valuation adjustments. Excluding this item, other noninterest income of $86 million decreased $48 million, or 36 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in the revenue recognized from Worldpay related to the tax receivable agreement and a decline in equity method earnings from the ownership interest in Worldpay. Compared to the prior quarter, other noninterest income excluding the Visa total return swap valuation adjustments decreased $17 million, or 17 percent, primarily driven by lower private equity investment income, partially offset by the revenue recognized from Worldpay related to the tax receivable agreement.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Compared to the year-ago quarter, noninterest expense was flat, including merger-related expenses in the current quarter. The merger-related expenses primarily impacted other noninterest expense, with a lesser impact on technology and communication expense. Excluding these expenses in the current quarter, as well as one-time employee bonuses following the recently-enacted tax reform and a Fifth Third Foundation contribution in the year-ago quarter, noninterest expense increased $5 million. Results reflected an increase in compensation and benefits resulting from an increase in incentive based payments from record commercial loan originations and capital markets activities, and continued technology investments, offset by the elimination of the FDIC surcharge.  

Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense increased $7 million, or 1 percent, reflecting merger-related expenses. Excluding the merger-related expenses in the current quarter, noninterest expense decreased $20 million, or 2 percent, despite elevated incentive based payments reflecting record commercial loan originations and capital markets activities. Results also reflect the elimination of the FDIC surcharge and continued technology investments.

  Average Interest-Earning Assets 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Capital ratios remained strong during the quarter. The CET1 capital ratio was 10.24 percent, the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.71 percent (excluding unrealized gains/losses), and 8.64 percent (including unrealized gains/losses). The Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 11.32 percent, the Total risk-based capital ratio was 14.48 percent, and the Tier I leverage ratio was 9.72 percent. Current period capital ratios were impacted by the accounting policy change related to investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for the LIHTC. The change in accounting policy reduced the current CET1 capital ratio by approximately 11 basis points.  

During the fourth quarter of 2018, Fifth Third entered into open market repurchase transactions of 14.9 million shares, or approximately $400 million, of its outstanding common stock, which settled between October 26, 2018, and November 14, 2018.  

Tax Rate  

The effective tax rate was 22.4 percent compared with negative 7.5 percent in the year-ago quarter and 20.7 percent in the prior quarter. The effective tax rates in all periods were impacted by the decision to retrospectively apply a change in accounting policy for investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for the LIHTC.

Other  

Fifth Third announced on December 28, 2018, that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“the Federal Reserve”) did not object to Fifth Third’s Resubmitted Capital Plan for potential capital actions through June 30, 2019.  

The capital actions in Fifth Third’s Resubmitted Capital Plan through June 30, 2019 remain unchanged compared to the originally submitted 2018 CCAR plan. The timing and amount of this activity is subject to market conditions and applicable securities laws. Through December 2018, Fifth Third has executed approximately $900 million of $1.81 billion in share repurchases authorized under the 2018 CCAR process. Additionally, Fifth Third continues to have the authorization to increase the common dividend to $0.24 beginning the second quarter of 2019.  

The pending acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  

As of December 31, 2018, Fifth Third Bank owned approximately 10.3 million units representing a 3.3 percent interest in Worldpay Holding, LLC, convertible into shares of Worldpay, Inc., a publicly traded firm. Based upon Worldpay’s closing price of $76.43 on December 31, 2018, Fifth Third’s interest in Worldpay was valued at approximately $780 million. The difference between the market value and the book value of Fifth Third’s interest in Worldpay’s shares is not recognized in Fifth Third’s equity or capital.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In addition to GAAP measures, management considers various Non-GAAP measures when evaluating the performance of the business, including: “net interest income (FTE),” “interest income (FTE),” “net interest margin (FTE),” “net interest rate spread (FTE),” “income before income taxes (FTE),” “tangible net income available to common shareholders,” “average tangible common equity,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “tangible common equity (excluding unrealized gains/losses),” “tangible common equity (including unrealized gains/losses),” “tangible equity,” “tangible book value per share,” “adjusted earnings per share,” “adjusted noninterest income,” “adjusted noninterest expense,” “pre-provision net revenue,” “adjusted efficiency ratio,” “ adjusted return on average common equity,” “adjusted return on average tangible common equity,” “adjusted net interest margin,” “adjusted pre-provision net revenue,” “adjusted return on average assets,” “efficiency ratio (FTE),” and certain ratios derived from these measures. The Bancorp believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by the Fifth Third management team to evaluate operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions.  

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and net interest margin as they provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.  

The Bancorp believes tangible net income available to common shareholders, average tangible common equity, tangible common equity (excluding unrealized gains/losses), tangible common equity (including unrealized gains/losses), tangible equity, tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity are important measures for evaluating the performance of the business without the impacts of intangible items, whether acquired or created internally, compared to other companies in the industry who present similar measures.  

The Bancorp believes adjusted earnings per share, noninterest income, noninterest expense, net interest income, net interest margin, pre-provision net revenue, efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, and return on average assets are important measures that adjust for significant, unusual, or large transactions that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of on-going financial performance and enhances comparability of results with prior periods.  

Management considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity and tangible common equity (including and excluding unrealized gains/losses), in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be Non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that providing the tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains/losses on certain assets and liabilities enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity without the effects of gains or losses some of which are uncertain and providing the tangible common equity ratio including unrealized gains/losses enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity if all unrealized gains or losses were to be monetized.  

Please note that although Non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight, they should not be considered in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for analysis using GAAP measures.  

Please see Reg. G reconciliations of all historical Non-GAAP measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, beginning on the following page.
