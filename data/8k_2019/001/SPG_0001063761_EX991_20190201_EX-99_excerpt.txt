 Footnotes to Unaudited Financial Information 

      Notes: 

(A)Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the related partnerships and joint ventures shown therein. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties. 

(B)The Unaudited Joint Venture Combined Statements of Operations do not include any operations or our share of net income or excess investment amortization related to our investments in Klépierre and HBS Global Properties. Amounts included in Footnote D below exclude our share of related activity for our investments in Klépierre and HBS Global Properties. For further information on Klépierre, reference should be made to financial information in Klépierre's public filings and additional discussion and analysis in our Form 10-K. 

(C)This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP, including FFO and FFO per share. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.   

We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sale, disposal or property insurance recoveries of, or any impairment related to, previously depreciated retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.  

We have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale, disposal or property insurance recoveries of, or any impairment relating to, previously depreciated retail operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, equity instruments, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.    

(D)Includes our share of: 

-Gains on land sales of $2.4 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $6.3 million and $12.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

-Straight-line adjustments increased income by $6.7 million and $7.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $28.5 million and $34.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

-Amortization of fair market value of leases from acquisitions increased income by $1.4 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $4.4 million and $6.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

(E)Gain upon acquisition of controlling interests, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $143.9 million and $288.8 million, respectively. Noncontrolling interest portion of the gain for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $6.6 million. 

(F)Includes noncontrolling interests gain upon acquisition of controlling interests, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment of $0.02 per share for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. 

(G)Includes a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $128.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. 

(H)Includes Basic and Diluted FFO per share related to a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $0.36 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. 

(I)Includes Diluted FFO allocable to common stockholders related to a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $111.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.

This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States, including FFO, FFO per share, funds available for distribution, net operating income (NOI), portfolio NOI, and comparable property NOI.

      NON-GAAP PRO-RATA FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

The following pro-rata financial information is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP pro-rata financial information aggregates our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in our property portfolio that we do not wholly own. The amounts in the column labeled "Our Share of Joint Ventures" were derived on a property-by-property or entity-by-entity basis by applying to each line item the ownership percentage interest used to arrive at our share of the net operations for the period consistent with the application of the equity method of accounting to each of our unconsolidated joint ventures. A similar calculation was performed for the amounts in the column labeled "Noncontrolling Interests," which represents the share of consolidated assets and net income or loss attributable to any noncontrolling interest.  

We do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the presentations of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items. The operating agreements of the unconsolidated joint ventures generally provide that partners may receive cash distributions (1) to the extent there is available cash from operations, (2) upon a capital event, such as a refinancing or sale or (3) upon liquidation of the venture. The amount of cash each partner receives is based upon specific provisions of each operating agreement and varies depending on factors including the amount of capital contributed by each partner and whether any contributions are entitled to priority distributions. Upon liquidation of the joint venture and after all liabilities, priority distributions and initial equity contributions have been repaid, the partners generally would be entitled to any residual cash remaining based on their respective legal ownership percentages.  

We provide pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our unconsolidated joint ventures when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results under GAAP. The presentation of pro-rata financial information has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations include:  

• The amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; and  

• Other companies in our industry may calculate their pro-rata interest differently than we do, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure.  

Because of these limitations, the pro-rata financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using the pro-rata financial information only supplementally.
