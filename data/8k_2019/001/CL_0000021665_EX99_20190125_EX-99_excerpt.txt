Exhibit 99  

 Colgate Announces 4th Quarter 2018 Results  

 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 25, 2019--Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) today reported worldwide Net sales of $3,811 million in fourth quarter 2018, a decrease of 2.0% versus fourth quarter 2017. Global unit volume increased 0.5%, pricing increased 2.5% and foreign exchange was negative 5.0%. The previously disclosed professional skin care acquisitions contributed 1.0% to Net sales and unit volume growth in the quarter. Organic sales (Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) increased 2.0%.  

 Net income and Diluted earnings per share in fourth quarter 2018 were $606 million and $0.70, respectively. Net income in fourth quarter 2018 included $32 million ($0.04 per diluted share) of aftertax charges resulting from the Company’s Global Growth and Efficiency Program.  

 Net income and Diluted earnings per share in fourth quarter 2017 were $323 million and $0.37, respectively. Net income in fourth quarter 2017 included $61 million ($0.07 per diluted share) of aftertax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and a charge related to U.S. tax reform of $275 million ($0.31 per diluted share).  

 Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods and the charge related to U.S. tax reform in 2017, Net income in fourth quarter 2018 was $638 million, a decrease of 3% versus fourth quarter 2017, and Diluted earnings per share in fourth quarter 2018 was $0.74, a decrease of 1% versus fourth quarter 2017.  

 Gross profit margin was 59.1% in fourth quarter 2018 versus 59.8% in fourth quarter 2017. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Gross profit margin was 59.4% in fourth quarter 2018, a decrease of 100 basis points versus the year ago quarter as higher raw and packaging material costs were partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives and higher pricing.  

 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 34.8% of Net sales in fourth quarter 2018 versus 34.6% of Net sales in fourth quarter 2017. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 70 basis points versus the year ago quarter to 34.6% of Net sales in fourth quarter 2018 due to higher overhead expenses, driven by higher logistics costs, and increased advertising investment, both as a percentage of Net sales. On an absolute basis, worldwide advertising investment increased 2% to $376 million in fourth quarter 2018 versus $369 million in the year ago quarter.  

 Operating profit decreased to $891 million in fourth quarter 2018 compared to $960 million in fourth quarter 2017. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Operating profit was $936 million in fourth quarter 2018, a decrease of 10% versus fourth quarter 2017. Operating profit margin was 23.4% in fourth quarter 2018 versus 24.7% in fourth quarter 2017. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Operating profit margin was 24.6% in fourth quarter 2018, a decrease of 210 basis points versus the year ago quarter. This decrease in Operating profit margin was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, both as a percentage of Net sales.  

 Net cash provided by operations year to date was $3,056 million compared to $3,054 million in the comparable 2017 period. Working capital as a percentage of Net sales was negative 1.7% compared to negative 2.0% in the year ago period.  

 Ian Cook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the fourth quarter results, “We are pleased with the improvement in organic sales growth this quarter, driven by 2.5% positive pricing.  

 “Colgate’s leadership of the global toothpaste market continued during the quarter with our global market share at 42.0% year to date. Our global leadership in manual toothbrushes also continued with Colgate’s global market share in that category at 32.3% year to date.”  

 Mr. Cook continued, “Looking ahead to 2019, based on current spot rates, we expect net sales to be flat to up low-single-digits, with organic sales growth of 2% to 4% as we are planning for increased investment behind our brands, higher pricing and strong innovation, led by the relaunches of Colgate Total and Hill’s Science Diet and our continued focus on naturals.  

 “We are also planning to invest in expanding our portfolio offerings by bringing brands like elmex and meridol into new markets and by broadening our e-commerce offerings, including direct to consumer, to build on our strong e-commerce growth in 2018. We also plan to continue to increase our investment behind our professional skin care businesses, Elta MD and PCA Skin.  

 “On a GAAP basis, based on current spot rates, we are planning for a year of gross margin expansion and expect a low-single-digit decline in earnings per share.  

 "Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both 2018 and 2019, the charge related to U.S. tax reform in 2018 and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018, based on current spot rates, we are planning for a year of gross margin expansion, increased advertising investment and a mid-single-digit decline in earnings per share. Our outlook reflects an increase in raw material prices, an increase in our tax rate year-over-year and the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, exchange rates and pricing.  

 “Given our plans to increase investment behind our brands to drive acceleration in organic sales growth, we believe our earnings outlook for 2019 is appropriate.”  

 At 11:00 a.m. ET today, Colgate will host a conference call to elaborate on fourth quarter results. To access this call as a webcast, please go to Colgate’s website at http://www.colgatepalmolive.com.  

 The following are comments about divisional performance for fourth quarter 2018 versus the year ago period. See attached Geographic Sales Analysis Percentage Changes and Segment Information tables for additional information on divisional net sales and operating profit.  

 North America (22% of Company Sales)  

 North America Net sales increased 5.0% in fourth quarter 2018. Unit volume increased 3.0%, pricing increased 2.5% and foreign exchange was negative 0.5%. The previously disclosed professional skin care acquisitions contributed 5.0% to Net sales and unit volume growth. Organic sales for North America increased 0.5% and organic unit volume decreased 2.0%.  

 Operating profit in North America decreased 7% in fourth quarter 2018 to $257 million, or 410 basis points to 30.6% of Net sales. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit, an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase in Other (income) expense, net, all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs, partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher overhead expenses, primarily driven by increased logistics costs. This increase in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the professional skin care acquisitions.  

 In the U.S., Colgate maintained leadership in the toothpaste category during the quarter with its market share at 34.8% year to date. Successful products include Colgate Optic White Stain Fighter, Colgate Optic White Stain-Less White and Tom’s of Maine toothpastes. In manual toothbrushes, Colgate widened its brand market leadership in the U.S. with its market share in that category at 41.5% year to date, supported by the success of Colgate 360° Total Advanced Optic White and Colgate Gum Health manual toothbrushes.

 Operating profit in Latin America decreased 17% in fourth quarter 2018 to $238 million, or 270 basis points to 26.8% of Net sales. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses, both as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was due to higher raw and packaging material costs, which included foreign exchange transaction costs, partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives and higher pricing. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to decreased advertising investment.  

 Colgate maintained its toothpaste leadership in Latin America during the quarter, with market share gains in Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Panama, Chile, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Products succeeding in the region include Colgate Natural Extracts, Colgate Total 12 Salud Visible and Colgate Triple Action Xtra Freshness toothpastes.

This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to an increase in Gross profit and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net, partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, all as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was primarily due to cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment, partially offset by lower overhead expenses. This decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to a non-recurring expense recorded in the year ago quarter.  

 Colgate maintained its toothpaste leadership in Europe during the quarter, with market share gains in France, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium. Products succeeding in oral care include Colgate Max White Expert Complete, Colgate Natural Extracts Charcoal and elmex toothpastes, Colgate 360° Advanced Whole Mouth Health and Colgate Slim Soft Advanced manual toothbrushes and Colgate Plax mouthwash.

 Africa/Eurasia Net sales decreased 5.0% during fourth quarter 2018. Unit volume decreased 3.5%, pricing increased 7.5% and foreign exchange was negative 9.0%.

 Operating profit in Africa/Eurasia decreased 11% in fourth quarter 2018 to $40 million, or 120 basis points to 17.2% of Net sales.

 Hill’s Operating profit increased 6% in fourth quarter 2018 to $188 million, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 20 basis points to 29.8% of Net sales. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit and an increase in Other (income) expense, net, largely offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses, all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs, partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives and higher pricing. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to lower overhead expenses partially offset by increased advertising investment. This increase in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to the expiration of a foreign sales tax benefit.

As a result, for all periods presented, only the service related component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs is included in Operating profit. The non-service related components (interest cost, expected return on assets and amortization of actuarial gains and losses) are included in a new line item, “Non-service related postretirement costs,” which is below Operating profit.

 Market Share Information  

 Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this press release are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods). The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors it uses to provide data are reliable, but it has not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.  

 Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements  

 This press release and the related webcast may contain forward-looking statements (as that term is defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its rules, regulations and releases) that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, net selling price increases, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings per share levels, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange volatility, cost-reduction plans including the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, tax rates, U.S. tax reform, new product introductions or commercial investment levels, acquisitions, divestitures, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. For more information about factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, investors should refer to the Company’s filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the information set forth under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q). Copies of these filings may be obtained upon request from the Company’s Investor Relations Department or on the Company’s website at http://www.colgatepalmolive.com.  

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 The following provides information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release and/or the related webcast:  

 This release discusses Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth, which is Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange as well as the impact from acquisitions and divestments. See “Geographic Sales Analysis Percentage Changes” for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 included with this release for a comparison of organic sales growth to Net sales growth in accordance with GAAP.  

 To supplement Colgate’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company has disclosed non-GAAP measures of operating results that exclude certain items. Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, Effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Diluted earnings per common share are discussed both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and, as applicable, the benefit from a foreign tax matter and charges related to U.S. tax reform (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included with this release for a reconciliation of these financial measures to the related GAAP measures.  

 The Company uses these financial measures internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as factors in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.  

 The Company defines free cash flow before dividends as Net cash provided by operations less Capital expenditures. As management uses this measure to evaluate the Company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. Free cash flow before dividends is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See “Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows” for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for a comparison of free cash flow before dividends to Net cash provided by operations as reported in accordance with GAAP.
