(NYSE: CAT) today announced fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2018. Sales and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $14.3 billion, compared with $12.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, an 11 percent increase. Fourth-quarter 2018 profit was $1.78 per share, compared with a loss of $2.18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $2.55, compared with fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted profit per share of $2.16, up 18 percent. Full-year sales and revenues in 2018 were $54.7 billion, up 20 percent from $45.5 billion in 2017. Full-year profit was $10.26 per share in 2018, compared with profit of $1.26 per share in 2017. Adjusted profit per share in 2018 was $11.22, up 63 percent compared with 2017 adjusted profit per share of $6.88. Adjusted profit per share excludes several adjustments consisting of restructuring costs, mark-to-market losses for remeasurement of pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans, certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments, the impact of U.S. tax reform and a gain on sale of an equity investment in 2017. Fourth-quarter 2018 Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) operating cash flow was $2.5 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company repurchased $1.8 billion of Caterpillar common stock and paid dividends of $507 million. For the full year of 2018, ME&T operating cash flow was $6.3 billion. During the year the company deployed significant capital, including the repurchase of $3.8 billion of Caterpillar common stock, dividend payments of $2.0 (more)  

 2 billion and a discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion. After returning $5.8 billion of capital to shareholders, the enterprise cash balance was $7.9 billion at the end of 2018, compared with $8.3 billion at the end of 2017. “In 2018, Caterpillar achieved record profit per share and returned significant levels of capital to shareholders,” said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby. “Our global team remained focused on serving our customers, executing our strategy and investing for future profitable growth.” 2019 Outlook Following a record year for profit per share, Caterpillar expects 2019 profit to increase to a range of $11.75 to $12.75 per share. “Our outlook assumes a modest sales increase based on the fundamentals of our diverse end markets as well as the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. We will continue to focus on operational excellence, including cost discipline, while investing in expanded offerings and services to drive long-term profitable growth,” added Umpleby. Beginning in 2019, the company does not plan to exclude restructuring costs from adjusted profit per share as these costs are expected to return to normalized levels. The outlook does not include a mark-to-market gain or loss for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans or any changes to estimates related to U.S. tax reform due to interpretations released in 2019.

 4 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Consolidated Sales and Revenues The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between the fourth quarter of 2017 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2018 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $14.342 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $1.446 billion, or 11 percent, compared with $12.896 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was due to higher sales volume driven by improved demand across all regions and in the three primary segments. Favorable price realization, primarily in Construction Industries, also contributed to the sales improvement. The increase was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts due to a stronger U.S. dollar.

 6 Consolidated Operating Profit The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between the fourth quarter of 2017 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2018 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses. Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $1.883 billion, compared with $1.387 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase of $496 million was mostly due to higher sales volume. Favorable price realization and lower restructuring costs were mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs and lower profit from Financial Products. Financial Products’ operating profit was lower primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses, which was mostly driven by a $72 million unfavorable impact from an increase in allowance rate and an increase in write- offs of $13 million, due to continued weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio.This was partially offset by higher average earning assets. Operating profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 13.1 percent, compared with 10.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.

 7 Other Profit/Loss Items Interest expense excluding Financial Products in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $99 million, a decrease of $70 million primarily due to an early debt retirement in the fourth quarter of 2017. Other income/expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of $417 million, compared with a loss of $107 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The unfavorable change was primarily a result of an increase in mark-to- market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and an unfavorable impact from equity securities. The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter reflected an annual effective tax rate of approximately 24 percent, compared with approximately 28 percent for the full year of 2017, excluding the items discussed below. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate beginning January 1, 2018, along with other changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. The provision for income taxes also included the following: • Non-cash benefits of $63 million and $111 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. • A $50 million increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to the $2.371 billion charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation. • A tax benefit of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. • A $130 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the change from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate. Global Workforce The global workforce increased about 7,300 during 2018, primarily due to higher production volumes.

The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume for construction equipment. Favorable price realization was mostly offset by unfavorable currency impacts due to a stronger U.S. dollar. In North America, the sales increase was driven by higher demand for new equipment, with about half due to an increase in dealer inventories. The increase in demand was primarily to support oil and gas activities, including pipelines, and non-residential building construction activities. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement. Construction activities remained at low levels in Latin America. Sales increased in EAME as infrastructure, road and non-residential building construction activities drove higher demand in Europe, partially offset by weakness in the Middle East. Sales in Asia/Pacific declined due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in a few other countries in the region. Unfavorable currency impacts also contributed to the sales decline. Construction Industries’ profit was $845 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $837 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in profit was a result of favorable price realization and higher sales volume, mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs, including material, labor and freight costs. (more)

The increase was primarily due to higher demand for both mining and heavy construction equipment, including quarry and aggregate. Mining activities were robust as commodity market fundamentals remained positive, and increased non-residential construction activities drove higher sales. Resource Industries’ profit was $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $210 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher material and freight costs. (more)

The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications except Industrial, which was flat. • Oil and Gas – Sales increased due to higher demand for reciprocating engines in North America for gas compression and well servicing applications. Sales of turbines and turbine-related services were about flat. • Power Generation – Sales improved across all regions, with the largest increases in North America and EAME primarily for reciprocating engine applications, including data centers and other large power generation projects. • Industrial – Sales were flat, with increases in Asia/Pacific and North America about offset by lower sales in EAME and Latin America. • Transportation – Sales were higher primarily due to rail services, driven by acquisitions. Energy & Transportation’s profit was $1.079 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $874 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume. The increase was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, including freight costs. (more)

The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America and Asia/Pacific. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment in Europe and Latin America. Financial Products’ segment profit was $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $233 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. About half of the decrease was due to an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services, which was driven by the absence of investment gains from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an unfavorable impact from mark-to-market in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial also contributed to lower profit. This increase was driven by a higher allowance rate and an increase in write-offs, due to continued weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. At the end of 2018, past dues at Cat Financial were 3.55 percent, compared with 2.78 percent at the end of 2017. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $189 million for 2018, compared with $114 million for 2017. As of December 31, 2018, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $511 million, or 1.80 percent of finance receivables, compared with $365 million, or 1.33 percent of finance receivables at December 31, 2017. The increase in past dues, write-offs and allowance for credit losses was primarily due to continued weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 2018, retail new business volume was $3.10 billion, a decrease of $313 million, or 9 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in Cat Power Finance. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $321 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $344 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to methodology differences and lower restructuring costs. Restructuring costs were $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. (more)  

 12 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q1: Can you provide more information on the reconciliation of significant items impacting 2018 and 2017 adjusted profit? A: In order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers, we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items. • Restructuring Costs – In recent years, we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure. During 2018, we incurred $386 million of restructuring costs. During 2017, we incurred $1.256 billion of restructuring costs, with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium. • Mark-to-Market Losses – We recognize actuarial gains and losses for our pension and OPEB plans as a mark-to-market gain or loss when incurred rather than amortizing them to earnings over time. For 2018, the mark-to-market adjustment was a net loss of $495 million, primarily due to lower than expected returns on plan assets, partially offset by higher interest rates. For 2017, the mark-to-market adjustment was a net loss of $301 million, primarily due to lower interest rates and a change in mortality assumptions, partially offset by better than expected returns on plan assets. • Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance Adjustments – Based on improved profits in the United States, we recognized a non-cash benefit of $63 million and $111 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively, to reduce the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets. During the third quarter of 2018, we recognized a non-cash charge of $59 million to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for prior years. • U.S. Tax Reform – During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a $2.371 billion charge due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation in December 2017. The provisionally estimated charge included a $596 million write-down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, beginning January 1, 2018, with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. During the third quarter of 2018, we recognized a $154 million reduction to the estimated charge for the write-down in net deferred tax assets. This reduction was primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to U.S. pension plans, treated as deductible on the 2017 U.S. tax return. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a $50 million increase to the estimated charge for the cost of mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. A reconciliation of these items can be found in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section on page 17. Q2: Can you discuss the unfavorable impact from equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2018? A: Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted a new U.S. GAAP accounting rule that requires our equity securities, primarily held by Insurance Services, to be measured at fair value through earnings. Previously, the fair value adjustments for these securities were reported in equity until the securities were sold or an impairment was recognized. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach, with no change to prior year financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a loss of $44 million related to fair value adjustments. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized gains on sales of securities of $68 million.

 13 Q3: Can you discuss changes in dealer inventories during the fourth quarter of 2018? A: Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $200 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and remained about flat during the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year of 2018, dealer inventories increased about $2.3 billion, compared with an increase of about $100 million during 2017. We believe the increase in dealer inventories is reflective of current end-user demand. Q4: Can you discuss changes to your order backlog by segment? A: At the end of the fourth quarter of 2018, the order backlog was $16.5 billion, about $800 million lower than the third quarter of 2018. The decrease was in Energy & Transportation and Resource Industries, partially offset by an increase in Construction Industries. The order backlog increased about $700 million from the end of 2017. The increase was in Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries, partially offset by a decrease in Resource Industries. Q5: Can you comment on expense related to your 2018 short-term incentive compensation plans? A: Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Fourth-quarter 2018 expense was about $310 million, compared with fourth-quarter 2017 expense of about $350 million. Full-year 2018 expense was about $1.4 billion, nearly the same as 2017. Q6: Do you expect to exclude restructuring costs from adjusted profit per share in 2019? A: On September 24, 2015, we announced a significant restructuring program through 2018 that is now substantially complete. Although we expect restructuring to continue as part of ongoing business activities, restructuring costs should decline in 2019, and we do not plan to exclude restructuring costs from adjusted profit per share in 2019.

 17 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Adjusted Profit The company believes it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for the company’s results to be meaningful to readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring costs, which are incurred in the current year to generate longer-term benefits, (ii) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (iii) certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments, (iv) U.S. tax reform impact and (v) a gain on the sale of an equity investment. The company does not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believes the non-GAAP measures will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends, and a means to assess the company’s period-over-period results. Reconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, consolidated profit before taxes, are as follows: Fourth Quarter Full Year (Millions of dollars) 2017 2018 2017 2018 Profit before taxes $ 1,111 $ 1,367 $ 4,082 $ 7,822 Restructuring costs 245 93 1,256 386 Mark-to-market losses 301 495 301 495 Gain on sale of equity investment — — (85) — Adjusted profit before taxes $ 1,657 $ 1,955 $ 5,554 $ 8,703 Reconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted profit per share, are as follows: Fourth Quarter Full Year 2017 2018 2017 2018 Profit (Loss) per share ($2.18) $1.78 $1.26 $10.26 Per share restructuring costs1 $0.31 $0.13 $1.68 $0.50 Per share mark-to-market losses2 $0.26 $0.66 $0.26 $0.64 Per share deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments ($0.18) ($0.11) ($0.18) ($0.01) Per share U.S. tax reform impact $3.91 $0.09 $3.95 ($0.17) Per share gain on sale of equity investment2 — — ($0.09) — Adjusted profit per share $2.16 $2.55 $6.88 $11.22 Per share amounts computed using fully diluted shares outstanding except for consolidated loss per share, which was computed using basic shares outstanding. 1At statutory tax rates. 2017 is prior to consideration of U.S. tax reform. Full-year 2017 also includes $15 million increase to prior year taxes related to non-U.S. restructuring costs. 2At statutory tax rates. 2017 is prior to consideration of U.S. tax reform. (more)
