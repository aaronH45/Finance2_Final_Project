LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: LYB) today announced net income for the fourth quarter 2018 of $0.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. Fourth quarter 2018 EBITDA was $1.2 billion. Full year 2018 net income was $4.7 billion, or $12.01 per share, and EBITDA was $6.9 billion. The full year 2018 included a $346 million non-cash tax settlement that increased earnings by $0.88 per share and $73 million of transaction and integration costs that decreased earnings by $0.14 per share. Integration activities related to the acquisition of A. Schulman are on schedule with $47 million in forward annual run-rate synergies as of December 31, 2018.

“During the past year LyondellBasell extended our proven track record of delivering strong earnings for our shareholders. Despite market challenges in the second half of 2018 and both planned and unplanned downtime that impacted fourth quarter earnings by approximately $225 million, we leveraged the diversity of our global business portfolio and the agility of our commercial teams to generate approximately $5.5 billion of cash from operating activities for the year. In 2018 we improved upon our company safety record and established new EBITDA records in our Intermediates & Derivatives and Technology segments through market improvements, targeted contracting strategies and an increased number of polyolefin technology licenses," said Bob Patel, LyondellBasell CEO.

"Our fourth quarter results were impacted by the extraordinary fall in the price of crude oil, unusual operational events and a very difficult refining market. As oil prices fell by 40% during the fourth quarter, our non-U.S. Olefins and Polyolefins business experienced declining demand as customers delayed orders and destocked inventories in expectations of lower pricing. This destocking and associated pricing pressures compounded the effects of typical fourth quarter seasonality. Our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment was also impacted by decreased automotive demand, low water levels on the Rhine River, extended maintenance at our Wesseling, Germany cracker and feedstock supply constraints at our Münchsmünster, Germany cracker during the fourth quarter. High U.S. gasoline inventories and unusually weak discounts for Maya crude oil pressured our fourth quarter refining margins. Nevertheless, we are well positioned to capture the benefits of expected refining market improvements with no planned maintenance at our refinery in 2019 or 2020."

"With the acquisition of A. Schulman in August, we captured an opportunity to expand into new markets, created an additional platform for growth and realized $47 million in forward annual run-rate synergies, with more to come in 2019 and 2020. We managed our business portfolio by launching an innovative recycling joint venture with Suez, strengthening our joint venture footprint in Asia, divesting a carbon black subsidiary in France and working toward the consolidation of assets from Linde at our La Porte, Texas site. In February, we increased our quarterly dividend by 11% and we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during 2018," Patel said.

OUTLOOK

"During the first weeks of the year, we have seen normalization of markets with increased polymer demand and modest improvements in the discount for Maya crude oil. LyondellBasell's growth accelerates in 2019 with the planned startup of our Hyperzone polyethylene plant and continued construction on our new PO/TBA plant which is on track for completion in 2021. Global polyethylene capacity additions are expected to moderate during 2019 and 2020, providing support for high industry operating rates and ethylene chain profitability." 

"Our strong balance sheet offers optionality for investment in our organic growth pipeline and value-creating inorganic opportunities while our cash flows continue to provide significant shareholder returns," said Patel.

LYONDELLBASELL BUSINESS RESULTS DISCUSSION BY REPORTING SEGMENT 

LyondellBasell manages operations through six operating segments: 1) Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas; 2) Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International; 3) Intermediates and Derivatives; 4) Advanced Polymer Solutions; 5) Refining; and 6) Technology. Results for our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment incorporates the businesses acquired from A. Schulman beginning on August 21, 2018. Historical segment results for Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas and Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International were recast as a result of the shift of polypropylene compounds, Catalloy and polybutene-1 product lines to Advanced Polymer Solutions.

Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas (O&P-Americas) - Our O&P-Americas segment produces and markets Olefins & Co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene.

Three months ended December 31, 2018 versus three months ended September 30, 2018 - EBITDA decreased by $73 million versus the third quarter 2018. Compared with the prior period, olefins results increased by approximately $70 million. Ethylene margin improved primarily due to improved ethylene price and a decline in the price of Gulf Coast ethane. Polyolefin results declined approximately $115 million primarily due to a decrease of approximately 4 cents per pound in the polyethylene spread over ethylene. Joint venture equity income decreased by $10 million.

Three months ended December 31, 2018 versus three months ended December 31, 2017 - EBITDA decreased $138 million versus the fourth quarter 2017. Compared with the prior period, olefins results decreased by approximately $55 million. Margin declined primarily due to a decrease in ethylene price. Polyolefin results decreased by approximately $65 million primarily due to declines in polyethylene margin and volume. 

Full year ended December 31, 2018 versus full year ended December 31, 2017 - EBITDA decreased $137 million versus 2017. Full year results were negatively impacted by last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory charges that were approximately $50 million higher than 2017. Compared with the prior period, olefins results decreased by approximately $445 million. Margin declined primarily due to a decrease in ethylene price of approximately 6 cents per pound. Polyolefin results increased by approximately $360 million driven by spread improvements in polyethylene and polypropylene over monomer of approximately 7 cents per pound and 3 cents per pound, respectively. Joint venture equity income increased by $16 million.

Volume declined due to planned and unplanned maintenance at our cracker in Wesseling, Germany and as a result of low Rhine River levels. Combined polyolefins results decreased approximately $90 million. Polyolefin margins declined driven by spread decreases in polyethylene and polypropylene over monomer of approximately 3 cents and 4 cents per pound, respectively. Joint venture equity income decreased by $43 million primarily due to planned maintenance.

Full year ended December 31, 2018 versus full year ended December 31, 2017 - EBITDA decreased by $764 million versus 2017, which included a gain of $108 million on the sale of our interest in Geosel. 2018 results included benefits of $36 million from the gain on the sale of our carbon black subsidiary in France and approximately $95 million due to an increase in the euro versus the U.S. dollar exchange rate relative to 2017. Compared with the prior period, olefins results decreased approximately $370 million. Margin declined with increased feedstock costs partially offset by increased ethylene prices. Volume declined approximately 10% primarily due to planned and unplanned maintenance at our Wesseling, Germany cracker and low Rhine River levels in the second half of 2018. Combined polyolefins results decreased approximately $345 million. Polyolefin margins declined driven by spread decreases in polyethylene and polypropylene over monomer of approximately 3 cents per pound and 2 cents per pound, respectively.
