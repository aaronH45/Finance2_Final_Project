EVERETT, WA, February 7, 2019 - Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”) (NYSE: FTV) today announced results for the fourth quarter 2018.

For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders were $222.8 million. For the same period, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $325.1 million. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018 were $0.66. For the same period, adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.91.

For the fourth quarter of 2018, revenues from continuing operations increased 11.4% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, with core revenue growth of 7.4%. 

James A. Lico, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “The fourth quarter provided a strong finish to what was another transformational year for Fortive, as we generated high single-digit core revenue growth and 30% adjusted net earnings growth. This performance demonstrated strong execution by our team as we continued to leverage the power of the Fortive Business System to reposition our portfolio in higher growth end-markets, while delivering continued share gains and driving innovation to enhance our long-term competitive advantage.”

For the first quarter of 2019, Fortive anticipates diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.44 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.68. For the full year 2019, Fortive expects diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.66. For the full year 2019, Fortive expects adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50, which excludes any contribution from the pending acquisition of the Advanced Sterilization Products business from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). 

Mr. Lico added, “The fundamentals across our enhanced portfolio remain strong and we expect to deliver another year of double-digit adjusted net earnings growth for our shareholders in 2019. We believe our businesses are well positioned to sustain continued out-performance in the year ahead, and we particularly look forward to welcoming ASP into the Fortive family and discussing the attractive opportunities ahead when the transaction closes.”

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release also references “adjusted net earnings,” “adjusted diluted net earnings per share,” and “core revenue,” which are non-GAAP financial measures.

The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial measures, but should instead be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

AND OTHER INFORMATION

Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations

We disclose the non-GAAP measures of historical adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and historical and forecasted adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, which make the following adjustments to GAAP net earnings and GAAP diluted net earnings per share:

•Excluding on a pretax basis amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; 

•Excluding on a pretax basis acquisition-related costs deemed significant (“Transaction Costs”);

•Excluding on a pretax basis the effect of deferred revenue fair value adjustments related to significant acquisitions; 

•Excluding on a pretax basis a non-recurring gain resulting from the sale of real property (“Gain on Sale of Real Property”); and

•Excluding the tax effect of the adjustments noted above. The tax effect of such adjustments was calculated by applying our overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount of each adjustment (unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment). We expect to apply our overall estimated effective tax rate to each adjustment going forward, and, as such, we are applying the estimated effective tax rate to each adjustment for the forecasted periods to facilitate comparisons in future periods;

•Excluding a non-recurring gain on a prior investment as a result of a corresponding acquisition (“Gain from Acquisition”); 

•Excluding the 2017 provisional amount estimated in connection with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the “TCJA Adjustments”) and subsequent adjustments to the provisional estimates; and

•Including the impact of the assumed conversion of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.

While we have a history of acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term and the deferred revenue fair value adjustments are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. In addition, the Transaction Costs are unique to each transaction, are impacted from period to period depending on the number of acquisitions or divestitures evaluated, pending or completed during such period, and the complexity of such transactions. We believe, however, that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible assets and deferred revenue fair value adjustments related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets and deferred revenue fair value adjustments, as applicable, have been fully amortized.

In June 2018, we issued $1.38 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of shares of our 5.00% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS”). Dividends on the MCPS are payable on a cumulative basis at an annual rate of 5.00% on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. Unless earlier 

8

converted, each share of the MCPS will automatically convert on July 1, 2021 into between, after giving effect to the prior anti-dilution adjustment, 10.9041 and 13.3575 shares of our common stock, subject to further anti-dilution adjustments. The number of shares of our common stock issuable on conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be determined based on the average volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) per share of our common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on and including the 22nd scheduled trading day immediately preceding July 1, 2021. For the purposes of calculating adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, we have excluded the MCPS dividend and, for the purposes of adjusted earnings per share, assumed the “if-converted” method of share dilution (the incremental shares of common stock deemed outstanding applying the “if-converted” method of share dilution, the “Converted Shares”). We believe that using the “if-converted” method provides additional insight to investors on the potential impact of the MCPS once they are converted into common stock no later than July 1, 2021.

The forecasted adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations does not reflect certain adjustments that are inherently difficult to predict or estimate due to their unknown timing, effect and/or significance.

The TCJA Adjustments identified above have been excluded from the GAAP measures identified above because items of this nature and/or size occur with inconsistent frequency or occur for reasons that may be unrelated to our commercial performance during the period and/or because we believe the corresponding adjustments are useful in assessing our potential ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period. We will adjust for, and identify as significant, acquisition and divestiture-related transaction costs, acquisition related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, and corresponding restructuring charges primarily related to acquisitions, in each case, incurred in a given period, if we determine that such costs and adjustments exceed the range of our typical transaction costs and adjustments, respectively, in a given period.

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing aspects of our operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors to understand the long-term profitability trends of our business, and facilitate comparisons of our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers.

These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Core Revenue

We use the term “core revenue” when referring to a corresponding GAAP revenue measure, excluding (1) the impact from acquired businesses and (2) the impact of currency translation. References to sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture. The portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

9

Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items because the nature, size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from sales measures because currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility. We believe that such exclusions, when presented with the corresponding GAAP measures, may assist in assessing the business trends and making comparisons of long-term performance.
