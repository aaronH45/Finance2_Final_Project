 Item 1.03.  

Bankruptcy or Receivership  

On January 29, 2019 (the “Petition Date”), PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the “Utility”) (together, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 (“Chapter 11”) of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors have requested joint administration of their Chapter 11 cases under the caption In re: PG&E Corporation, et al., Case No. 19-30088 (the “Chapter 11 Cases”).  

The Debtors continue to operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors are seeking approval from the Bankruptcy Court of a variety of “first day” motions, including motions to obtain debtor-in-possession financing and other customary relief intended to assure the Debtors’ ability to continue their ordinary course operations.  

Debtor-in-Possession (“DIP”) Financing  

As previously reported, on January 21, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into a commitment letter with certain financial institutions for DIP financing. On January 28, 2019, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) granted the Utility exemptions from the requirement of prior CPUC approval for issuance of debt instruments for the incurrence of the DIP financing. The CPUC also indicated its position that the exemptions do not extend to the transfer of ownership of any Utility asset that is pledged as part of the DIP financing and that in the event of the Utility’s default under the DIP financing, the Utility would need to seek the CPUC’s approval to execute such a transfer. Further, the CPUC indicated that the Utility’s “expenditure of the initial DIP financing funds for any purposes may not be recovered from ratepayers without Commission approval in a future application for rate recovery” and that the Utility “bears the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of any expenditure.”  

Subsequently, in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on the Petition Date, the Debtors filed a motion (the “DIP Motion”) seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of DIP financing on the terms and conditions set forth in a proposed Senior Secured Superpriority Debtor-in-Possession Credit, Guaranty and Security Agreement (the “DIP Credit Agreement”), by and among PG&E Corporation, as Guarantor, the Utility, as Borrower, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as lenders and issuing lenders (the “DIP Lenders”), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Citibank, N.A., as collateral agent. If the DIP financing is approved by the Bankruptcy Court as proposed:  

   •    

the DIP Lenders would provide $5.5 billion in senior secured superpriority DIP credit facilities in the form of (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $3.5 billion (the “DIP Revolving Facility”), $1.5 billion of which would be available through a subfacility in the form of letters of credit, (ii) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (the “DIP Initial Term Loan Facility”) and (iii) a delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (together with the DIP Revolving Facility and the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility, the “DIP Facilities”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the DIP Credit Agreement;  

   •    

borrowings under the DIP Facilities would be senior secured obligations of the Utility, secured by substantially all of the Utility’s assets and entitled to superpriority administrative expense claim status in the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case;  

   •    

the Utility’s obligations under the DIP Facilities would be guaranteed by PG&E Corporation, and such guarantee would be a senior secured obligation of PG&E Corporation, secured by substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s assets and entitled to superpriority administrative expense claim status in PG&E Corporation’s Chapter 11 Case;  

   •    

the scheduled maturity of the DIP Facilities would be December 31, 2020, subject to the Utility’s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions are satisfied; and  

   •    

the Utility would pay customary fees and expenses in connection with obtaining the DIP Facilities.  

2   

The DIP Credit Agreement is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, which has not been obtained at this time. The Debtors are seeking interim approval of the DIP Facilities, and availability of a portion of the DIP Revolving Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion, at an interim hearing in the Bankruptcy Court on or about January 29, 2019, and final approval, and availability of the remaining amount of DIP Facilities in the amount of $4.0 billion, at a final hearing. The Debtors are unable to predict the date of the final hearing but expect it to occur within 30 to 45 days after the Petition Date. The Debtors anticipate that the DIP Credit Agreement will become effective promptly following interim approval of the DIP Facilities by the Bankruptcy Court. The foregoing description of the DIP Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the final, executed DIP Credit Agreement, as approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
