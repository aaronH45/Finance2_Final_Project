Item 8.01 Other Events  

Morgan Stanley (the “Firm”) today announced that the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Firm’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) has determined in consultation with the Firm’s Board of Directors the 2018 compensation for James P. Gorman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Firm. 

The Compensation Committee based its decision on its assessment of Mr. Gorman’s outstanding individual performance through the Firm’s continued execution of its long-term strategic objectives and the Firm’s strong financial performance for 2018. The Compensation Committee also noted Mr. Gorman’s overall leadership with respect to Firm culture, and among clients, shareholders, regulators and employees. Under Mr. Gorman’s leadership, for 2018, the Firm achieved record revenues and earnings, with net revenues of $40.1 billion compared with $37.9 billion a year ago1, pre-tax income2 of $11.2 billion compared with $10.4 billion a year ago1 and net income of $8.8 billion compared with $6.1 billion a year ago.1 Combined with continued expense discipline, the Firm delivered higher annual returns producing a return on average common equity of 11.8%3, up significantly from 8.0% last year3 and within the Firm’s 2018–2019 strategic objective of 10%–13%3, and return on average tangible common equity of 13.5%3, within the Firm’s 2018–2019 strategic objective of 11.5%–14.5%.3 

Mr. Gorman’s 2018 compensation is comprised of four parts: a base salary of $1.5 million; a cash bonus of $6.875 million; a deferred equity award of $6.875 million; and a performance-vested equity award of $13.75 million that converts to shares only if the Firm meets predetermined performance goals with respect to (a) average Firm return on equity and (b) relative total shareholder return over the three-year performance period. The Compensation Committee increased the return on equity goals of the performance-vested equity award from 10% to 11% to earn this portion of the award, from 11.5% to 12.5% to earn a maximum payout of 1.5 times this portion of the award, and from less than 5% to less than 6% for cancellation of this portion of the award without payout. 

Consistent with previous years, 75% of Mr. Gorman’s incentive compensation is deferred over three years and is subject to clawback. For 2018, 100% of Mr. Gorman’s deferred incentive compensation is delivered in the form of equity awards, an increased proportion from prior years, further aligning his compensation with shareholders’ interests. 

1Reflects full year results for 2018 and 2017. See page 4 of Exhibit 99.1 to the Firm’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 17, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, containing the Firm’s earnings press release for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 (the “Earnings Form 8-K”). 

2Pre-tax income represents income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes. 

3The Firm’s strategic objectives for return on average common equity (“ROE”) and return on average tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) were determined excluding intermittent discrete tax items. ROE, excluding intermittent discrete tax items was 11.5% for 2018 and 9.4% for 2017, and ROTCE excluding intermittent discrete tax items was 13.2% for 2018. ROE and ROTCE measures both reported and excluding intermittent discrete tax benefits are non-GAAP financial measures. For further discussion, see page 1, and the related endnotes thereto, of Exhibit 99.2 to the Firm’s Earnings Form 8-K, which contains the Firm’s Quarterly Financial Supplement - 4Q 2018.
