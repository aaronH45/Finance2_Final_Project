 Item 2.02.  

Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On February 15, 2019, Newell Brands Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release and accompanying tables (the “Earnings Release”) to report the Company’s earnings for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 (the “Fourth Quarter 2018” and “Full Year 2018”, respectively).  

The Company is updating its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and related reconciliation tables reported in the Earnings Release to reflect a change in income tax between continued operations and discontinued operations solely for GAAP purposes. The change in income tax does not impact the Non-GAAP results presented in the Earnings Release and does not affect total Company net income or diluted earnings per share, as reported for Fourth Quarter 2018 or Full Year 2018.  

This change in income tax has the effect of decreasing the income tax benefit for continuing operations for the Fourth Quarter 2018 and Full Year 2018 by $27 million, resulting in a decrease in net income from continuing operations of $27 million and a corresponding increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $27 million for the Fourth Quarter 2018 and an increase of $27 million in net loss from continuing operations and a corresponding decrease in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the Full Year 2018. This change in income tax also impacts the reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and from discontinued operations in the corresponding periods. The updated tables, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, reflect the impact of the change in income tax in Fourth Quarter 2018 and for Full Year 2018, respectively.  

The information in this Form 8-K shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
