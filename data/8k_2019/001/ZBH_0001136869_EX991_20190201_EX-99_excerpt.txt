Website Information 

We routinely post important information for investors on our website, www.zimmerbiomet.com, in the “Investor Relations” section. We use this website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this document. 

Reclassifications 

Beginning in the second quarter 2018, in our consolidated statements of earnings we have reclassified expenses that were previously recognized in a financial statement line item labeled, “Acquisition, quality remediation and other” (and prior to that, labeled “Special items”) to the financial statement line items of “Research and development”, “Selling, general and administrative”, “Goodwill and intangible asset impairment”, “Acquisition, integration and related”, and “Quality remediation”. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies  

Page 5 of 25 

and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Sales change information for the three-month period and the year ended December 31, 2018 are presented on a GAAP (reported) basis and on a constant currency basis. Constant currency percentage changes exclude the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. They are calculated by translating current and prior-period sales at the same predetermined exchange rate. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases.  

Net earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2018 are presented on a GAAP (reported) basis and on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the effects of inventory step-up; certain inventory and manufacturing-related charges, including charges to discontinue certain product lines; intangible asset amortization; goodwill and intangible asset impairment; acquisition, integration and related expenses; quality remediation expenses; certain litigation gains and charges; expenses to comply with the new European Union Medical Device Regulation; other charges; any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items; the effect of U.S. tax reform; other certain tax adjustments; and provide for the effect of dilutive shares assuming net earnings in periods of a reported net loss.  

Free cash flow is an additional non-GAAP measure that is presented in this press release. Free cash flow is computed by deducting additions to instruments and other property, plant and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. 

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this press release. This press release also contains supplemental reconciliations of additional non-GAAP financial measures that the Company presents in other contexts. These additional non-GAAP financial measures are computed from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as indicated in the applicable reconciliation. 

Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating the performance of the Company. Management believes these measures offer the ability to make period-to-period comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported income but that do not impact the fundamentals of our operations. The non-GAAP measures enable the evaluation of operating results and trend analysis by allowing a reader to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items that are excluded from the non-GAAP measures. In addition, constant currency sales changes, adjusted operating profit, adjusted diluted  

Page 6 of 25 

earnings per share and free cash flow are used as performance metrics in our incentive compensation programs. 

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release also includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for the year ending December 31, 2019. We calculate forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For instance, we exclude the impact of certain potential charges or gains connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts and certain legal and tax matters. Other than projected free cash flow for the year ending December 31, 2019, for which a reconciliation is provided, we have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are not available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts. It is probable that these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

(1)  

Inventory and manufacturing-related charges relate to excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines we intend to discontinue and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges. The excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines are driven by acquisitions where there are competing product lines and we have plans to discontinue one of the competing product lines.  

(2)  

We exclude intangible asset amortization from our non-GAAP financial measures because we internally assess our performance against our peers without this amortization. Due to various levels of acquisitions among our peers, intangible asset amortization can vary significantly from company to company. 

(3)  

In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized $3.8 million of intangible asset impairment from merger-related in-process research and development intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $975.9 million. The impairment was comprised of $401.2 million in our Spine less Asia Pacific reporting unit, $567.0 million in our EMEA reporting unit and $7.7 million from an insignificant reporting unit. 

Page 17 of 25 

(4)  

The acquisition, integration and related expenses we have excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures resulted from our merger with Biomet in 2015 and various acquisitions we consummated in 2016. For Biomet, we have detailed integration roadmaps that cover a three year period from the merger date to accomplish the tasks we feel are necessary to integrate the businesses. For the various 2016 acquisitions, we also have integration plans that are necessary to integrate the businesses. The acquisition, integration and related expenses include the following types of expenses:  

•  

Consulting and professional fees related to third-party integration consulting performed in a variety of areas, such as tax, compliance, logistics and human resources, and legal fees related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions.  

•  

Employee termination benefits related to terminating employees with overlapping responsibilities in various areas of our business.  

•  

Dedicated project personnel expenses which include the salary, benefits, travel expenses and other costs directly associated with employees who are 100 percent dedicated to our integration of acquired businesses and employees who have been notified of termination, but are continuing to work on transferring their responsibilities.  

•  

Contract termination expenses related to terminated contracts, primarily with sales agents and distribution agreements.  

•  

Other various expenses to relocate facilities, integrate information technology, losses incurred on assets resulting from the applicable acquisition, and other various expenses. 

(5)  

We are addressing inspectional observations on Form 483 and a Warning Letter issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) following its inspections of our Warsaw North Campus facility, among other matters. This quality remediation has required us to devote significant financial resources and is for a discrete period of time. The majority of the expenses are related to consultants who are helping us to update previous documents and redesign certain processes. 

(6)  

We are involved in routine patent litigation, product liability litigation, commercial litigation and other various litigation matters. We review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine if excluding the losses or gains will provide our investors with useful incremental information. Litigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results. The litigation charges and gains excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in the periods presented relate to product liability matters where we have received numerous claims on specific products and intellectual property litigation. In regards to the product liability matters, due to the complexities involved and claims filed in multiple districts, the expenses associated with these matters are significant to our operating results. Once the litigation matter has been excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in a particular period, any additional expenses or gains from changes in estimates are also excluded, even if they are not significant, to ensure consistency in our non-GAAP financial measures from period-to-period. 

(7)  

The new European Union Medical Device Regulation imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements. The new regulations will require currently-approved medical devices a transition period until May 2020 to meet the additional requirements. For certain devices, this transition period can be extended until May 2024. We are excluding from our non-GAAP financial measures the incremental costs incurred to comply with the regulations related to our currently-approved medical devices. The incremental costs primarily include third-party consulting necessary to supplement our internal resources. 

(8)  

We have incurred other various expenses from specific events or projects that we consider highly variable or have a significant impact to our operating results that we have excluded from our non-GAAP measures. This includes legal entity and operational restructuring as well as our costs of complying with our Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the U.S. government related to certain Foreign Corrupt Practices Act matters involving Biomet and certain of its subsidiaries. Under the DPA, which has a three-year term, we are subject to oversight by an independent compliance monitor, which monitorship commenced in July 2017. The excluded costs include the fees paid to the independent compliance monitor and to external legal counsel assisting in the matter. 

(9)  

In 2018, we finalized our estimates of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”) based upon final guidance issued by U.S. tax authorities. 

(10)  

Other certain tax adjustments primarily relate to changes in tax rates on deferred tax liabilities recorded on intangible assets recognized in acquisition-related accounting and adjustments from internal restructuring transactions that provide us access to offshore funds in a tax efficient manner.

(1)  

Inventory step-up and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges relate to inventory step-up expense, excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines we intend to discontinue and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges. Inventory step-up expense represents the incremental expense of inventory sold recognized at its fair value after business combination accounting is applied versus the expense that would have been recognized if sold at its cost to manufacture. Since only the inventory that existed at the business combination date was stepped-up to fair value, we believe excluding the incremental expense provides investors useful information as to what our costs may have been if we had not been required to increase the inventory’s book value to fair value. The excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines are driven by acquisitions where there are competing product lines and we have plans to discontinue one of the competing product lines.  

(2)  

We exclude intangible asset amortization from our non-GAAP financial measures because we internally assess our performance against our peers without this amortization. Due to various levels of acquisitions among our peers, intangible asset amortization can vary significantly from company to company. 

(3)  

In the second quarter of 2017, we recognized $18.8 million and $8.0 million of intangible asset impairment from Biomet merger-related in-process research and development and trademark intangible assets, respectively. In the third quarter of 2017, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $32.7 million on our Office Based Technologies reporting unit. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $272.0 million on our Spine less Asia Pacific reporting unit.

The excluded costs include the fees paid to the independent compliance monitor and to external legal counsel assisting in the matter. 

(8)  

The 2017 Tax Act resulted in a net favorable provisional adjustment due to the reduction of deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings and revaluation of deferred tax liabilities to a 21 percent rate, which was partially offset by provisional tax charges related to the toll charge provision of the 2017 Tax Act. 

(9)  

Other certain tax adjustments primarily relate to tax benefits from lower tax rates unrelated to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, net favorable resolutions of various tax matters and net favorable adjustments from internal restructuring transactions.
