“We reported record earnings for the quarter driven by strong volume growth, core pricing gains, and regaining positive productivity momentum,” said Lance Fritz, Union Pacific chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Building on this progress, we are advancing the implementation schedule for Unified Plan 2020. Since starting this initiative in October, we have improved on-time service for our customers while at the same time eliminating excess costs and improving the utilization of network resources.”  

 Fourth Quarter Summary  

 Operating revenue of $5.8 billion was up 6 percent in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to the fourth quarter 2017. Fourth quarter business volumes, as measured by total revenue carloads, increased 3 percent compared to 2017. Strong growth in industrial and premium shipments more than offset declines in agricultural products and energy. In addition:  

   ·    Quarterly freight revenue increased 6 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2017, as positive volume, increased fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains all contributed to the increase, but were partially offset by negative business mix. 

   ·    Union Pacific’s operating ratio of 61.6 percent improved 1.1 points compared to adjusted fourth quarter 2017. 

   ·    The $2.33 per gallon average quarterly diesel fuel price in the fourth quarter 2018 was 15 percent higher than the fourth quarter 2017. 

   ·    Quarterly train speed, as reported to the Association of American Railroads, was 24.4 mph, 3 percent slower than the fourth quarter 2017. 

   ·    Terminal dwell was 26.7 hours, an 18 percent improvement compared to the fourth quarter 2017. 

   ·    Union Pacific repurchased 8 million shares in the fourth quarter 2018 at an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. Union Pacific also received 4.5 million shares to complete a $3.6 billion Accelerated Share Repurchase program initiated in June 2018.

 *Total debt plus net present value of operating leases plus after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB obligation divided by net income less other income plus income tax expense, depreciation, interest expense, and interest on present value of operating leases. Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and interest on present value of operating leases) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the Company’s ability to sustain given debt levels (including leases) with the cash generated from operations. In addition, a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the Company’s credit rating. Adjusted debt to Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income. The table above provides reconciliations from net income to adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. At December 31, 2018, in transition to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019, the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 3.7%. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, operating leases were discounted using our effective interest rate on debt of 4.6% and 4.7%, respectively.

We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments. In addition, we currently use ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is Return on Average Common Shareholders’ Equity. The tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to ROIC.

 * The above tables reconcile our results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 to adjusted results that exclude the impact of certain items identified as affecting comparability. We use adjusted operating income, adjusted income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share ("EPS") and adjusted operating ratio, as applicable, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide relevant and useful information for management and investors because they clarify our actual operating performance by excluding certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, operating income, income taxes, net income, diluted EPS, and operating ratio, as indicators of operating performance.
