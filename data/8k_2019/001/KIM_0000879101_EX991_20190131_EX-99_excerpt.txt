 Operating Results   

 Pro-rata occupancy ended the quarter at 95.8%, flat compared to the third quarter of 2018 and representing a 20-basis-point decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2018 occupancy was reduced 20 basis points due to the bankruptcies of Toys R Us and Sears.
