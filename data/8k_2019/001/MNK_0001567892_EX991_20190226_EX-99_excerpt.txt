[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The adjusted amounts for this period exclude depreciation and intangible asset amortization for the Specialty Generics Disposal Group given its classification as held-for-sale through the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), depreciation and amortization are not recorded during the period in which a disposal group is classified as held-for-sale, thus the Company's financial results presented above exclude depreciation and amortization related to the Specialty Generics Disposal Group as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(i) Includes depreciation related to R&D.

Consistent with historical periods, intangible asset amortization is a non-gaap adjustment. As such, the "as adjusted" figures presented in the non-gaap measures table above exclude depreciation.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Specialty Generics Disposal Group was reclassified to held and used and measured at its carrying amount before it was classified as held-for-sale, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the disposal group been continuously classified as held and used. The effect of the required adjustment will be reflected in income from continuing operations during the fourth quarter of 2018, the period in which the held-for-sale criteria were no longer met. The Company intends to reflect the Q1, Q2 and Q3 depreciation catch-up recorded in Q4 as a non-gaap adjustment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, but not for year-to-date fiscal 2018 in the non-gaap measures table.

(2) Includes pre-tax accelerated depreciation.

(3) Represents the incremental tax effect associated with the intercompany financing and associated legal entity ownership reorganization commenced during the nine months ended September 28, 2018.

(4) Represents the incremental tax effect associated with the impact of the U.S. tax reform bill being signed into law.

(5) Includes tax effects of above adjustments, as well as certain installment sale transactions and other intercompany transactions.
