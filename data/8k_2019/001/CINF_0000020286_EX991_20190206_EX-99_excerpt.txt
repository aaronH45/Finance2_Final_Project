Insurance Operations Fourth-Quarter Highlights

•93.9 percent fourth-quarter 2018 property casualty combined ratio, up from 92.9 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017. Full-year 2018 property casualty combined ratio at 96.4 percent, with net written premiums up 4 percent.

•4 percent increase in fourth-quarter 2018 net written premiums, reflecting price increases and premium growth initiatives.

•$158 million fourth-quarter 2018 property casualty new business written premiums. Agencies appointed since the beginning of 2017 contributed $21 million or 13 percent of total fourth-quarter new business written premiums. 

•13 percent growth in term life insurance earned premiums, with $3 million of fourth-quarter 2018 life insurance subsidiary net income.

Investment and Balance Sheet Highlights 

•3 percent or $5 million rise in fourth-quarter 2018 pretax investment income, including 9 percent growth for stock portfolio dividends and 1 percent growth for bond interest income. 

•2 percent full-year decrease in fair value of total investments at December 31, 2018, including decreases of 5 percent for the stock portfolio and less than 1 percent for the bond portfolio.

•$2.478 billion parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end 2018, down 1 percent from a year ago. 

Finishing 2018 Strong 

Steven J. Johnston, president and chief executive officer, commented: “Non-GAAP operating income finished the year strong, increasing 21 percent to $549 million, compared with year-end 2017. While lower tax rates bolstered the result, even on a pretax basis we achieved healthy non-GAAP operating income growth of 12 percent year over year.

“Full-year 2018 net income declined 73 percent compared with year-end 2017. As I mentioned last year, these large swings in our net income are mostly attributable to a change in accounting rules as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This accounting change will continue to create a lot of volatility in net income as equity security unrealized investment gains and losses flow through the income statement instead of the balance sheet as they would have prior to 2018. 

“The communities we serve through our insurance business saw an unusually high level of weather-related catastrophe activity near the end of 2018. While no one likes to witness the pain and destruction these events bring, it is when our field claims representatives shine, delivering support to our policyholders and agents with empathy and warmth.

“Catastrophes added 7.0 points to our fourth-quarter combined ratio, 6.1 points more than for the fourth quarter of 2017, bringing that measure to 93.9 percent. Looking beyond the impact of catastrophe losses and reserve development on prior accident years, we can see that our underlying book of business improved 3.2 points to reach 90.1 percent – our best result in 10 quarters.

“On a full-year basis, our combined ratio improved 1.1 points to 96.4 percent compared with year-end 2017. Our current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses remained nearly flat for 2018 at 92.4 percent.” 

Continuing Property Casualty Growth

“For the first time, full-year property casualty net written premiums exceeded $5 billion. New and renewal business written through our independent agencies grew year over year for each of our property casualty insurance segments. For our life insurance segment, earned premiums rose 8 percent. 

“Our profitable growth is the result of focused execution of our strategic initiatives to refine our pricing precision, enter new product lines and marketing territories and to slowly expand our independent agency force. 

“We still expect our acquisition of MSP Underwriting Limited to close during the first quarter of 2019. We believe MSP, operating through Beaufort Underwriting Agency Limited, will add profitable premium growth. And, we are looking forward to the additional expertise this team will bring to our organization.”

Following Proven Long-Term Investment Strategy

“Despite the pressure on equity markets at the end of the year, at December 31, 2018, our total portfolio still had more than $2.5 billion in appreciated value before taxes. Our insurance business continues to provide cash that we invest in high-quality bonds and dividend-paying stocks. We are poised to further benefit from these purchases when the markets rebound, helping to create value for shareholders over time. 

“Our book value declined 4.4 percent to $48.10 at December 31 compared with year-end 2017, resulting in a negative 0.1 percent value creation ratio. However, we maintain a long-term perspective and aren't swayed by the short-term, periodic volatility our equity-investment strategy can produce. On a five-year average basis our value creation ratio is 10.7 percent – within our target range. 

“The board of directors' recent decision to increase the cash dividend demonstrates their confidence in the future success of our strategies and sets the stage for a 59th consecutive year of increasing regular annual dividends.”

Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures

(See attached tables for reconciliations; additional prior-period reconciliations available at cinfin.com/investors.)

Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data. 

Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas – property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP results to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management’s control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis. 

•Non-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding investment gains and losses (defined as investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company’s insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses on fixed-maturity securities sold in any period may be subject to management’s discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses are recognized from certain changes in 

 CINF 4Q18 Release 13

market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period. 

For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information. 

•Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries. That is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and our excess and surplus lines segment plus our reinsurance assumed operations. 

•Life insurance subsidiary results: To supplement life insurance reporting segment disclosures related to our life insurance operation, we also evaluate results for that operation on a basis that includes life insurance subsidiary investment income, or investment income plus investment gains and losses, that are also included in our investments reporting segment. We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products.

Other Measures

•Value creation ratio: This is a measure of shareholder value creation that management believes captures the contribution of the company’s insurance operations, the success of its investment strategy and the importance placed on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio measure is made up of two primary components: (1) rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. Management believes this measure is useful, providing a meaningful measure of long-term progress in creating shareholder value. It is intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, and uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as adoption of Accounting Standards Updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting.

•Statutory accounting rules: For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, insurers also must calculate certain data according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC’s Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, which may be, and has been, modified by various state insurance departments and differ from GAAP. Statutory data is publicly available, and various organizations use it to calculate aggregate industry data, study industry trends and compare insurance companies. 

•Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules, property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. Earned premium, used in both statutory and GAAP accounting, is calculated ratably over the policy term. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.
