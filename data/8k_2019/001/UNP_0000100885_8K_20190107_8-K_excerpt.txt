 (c) On January 7, 2019, Union Pacific Corporation (the Company) announced its Board of Directors, acting upon recommendation of the Compensation and Benefits Committee, approved the appointment of Jim Vena, as its Chief Operating Officer, effective January 14, 2019. Mr. Vena will also serve as the Chief Operating Officer of Union Pacific Railroad Company, the principal operating company of the Company. Mr. Vena, age 60, previously served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Canadian National Railway Company (CN) from February 2013 until his retirement in June 2016. Mr. Vena served in various positions of increasing responsibility over his forty year career with CN, including as a brakeman, yardmaster, conductor, locomotive engineer, superintendent and region vice-president. During his tenure at CN, Mr. Vena implemented the Precision Scheduled Railroad model.   

 ﻿  

 Mr. Vena will receive an annual base salary of $600,000. His annual target bonus opportunity is $750,000, with payout dependent on the Company’s formulaic bonus program under the Company’s 2019 Annual Incentive Plan. Mr. Vena will receive a $4,000,000 initial new hire equity grant award (the Equity Grant) consisting of 60% performance stock units and 40% stock options, with a two year vesting period, prorated and payable annually based on the Company’s operating income and operating ratio.  

 ﻿  

 As an inducement, the Company agreed that if Mr. Vena’s employment is terminated prior to the end of the Equity Grant vesting period, he will receive, in exchange for a release, a cash payment equal to one year’s base salary as well as a pro-rated share of the Equity Grant determined by the number of months worked versus the twenty-four month retention period, up to a maximum of $1.5 million in equity. In addition, if the Company materially reduces or changes the responsibilities of the position, Mr. Vena may choose to terminate his employment and will be eligible to retain any vested portion of the Equity Grant.   

 There is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Vena and any other person pursuant to which he was selected as an officer. There are no family relationships between Mr. Vena and any director or executive officer of the Company. Mr. Vena is not a party to any transaction in which the Company is a participant.
