FALLS CHURCH, Va. - General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported full-year earnings from continuing operations of $3.4 billion on revenue of $36.2 billion, and quarterly earnings from continuing operations of $909 million on $10.4 billion in revenue. Year-over-year revenue grew in all five segments.

Fourth-quarter 2018 earnings from continuing operations, which grew 42.9 percent over fourth-quarter 2017, would have grown 20.4 percent absent a one-time, non-cash decrement to earnings in 2017 from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On a per share basis, diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations was $3.07, a 46.2 percent increase over the year-ago quarter. For the year, diluted EPS from continuing operations was $11.22, a 17.4 percent increase from 2017.

“General Dynamics delivered solid performance in 2018,” said Phebe N. Novakovic, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our Aerospace segment successfully managed through a new model transition while achieving good order intake. Our defense businesses had strong operating performance and continued to book significant new business.”

PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION - (UNAUDITED)

DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS

(a)Return on equity is calculated by dividing earnings from continuing operations for the latest 12-month period by our average equity during that period.

(b)Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity as of year end.

(c)Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity as of year end.

(d)Book value per share is calculated as total equity divided by total outstanding shares as of year end.

(e)Includes independent research and development and Aerospace product-development costs.

(f)We believe earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a useful measure for investors because it provides another measure of our profitability and our ability to service our debt. We calculate EBITDA by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to earnings from continuing operations. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA is earnings from continuing operations. 

(g)We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to free cash flow from operations is net cash provided by operating activities.

(h)We believe return on invested capital (ROIC) is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense, calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss. ROIC excludes goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to net operating profit after taxes is earnings from continuing operations.

*The estimated potential contract value includes work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, including options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase new aircraft and aircraft services. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. For IDIQ contracts, we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value.
