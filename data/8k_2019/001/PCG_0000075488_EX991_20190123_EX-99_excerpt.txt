Non-GAAP Information PG&E refers to the term “Adjusted EBITDA” in various places in this presentation. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA is provided herein in order to provide a measure that may allow investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of certain items impacting comparability listed below. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as PG&E Corporation’s net income plus income tax provision (or less income tax benefit); less other income, net; plus interest expense; less interest income; plus depreciation, amortization and decommissioning; plus 2017 Northern California wildfire- and Butte fire-related costs; less insurance recoveries, and plus a penalty decision in connection with the San Bruno incident. Adjusted EBITDA is not a substitute or alternative for GAAP measures such as net income and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. See the Appendix for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA. From time to time PG&E Corporation discloses “earnings from operations”. “Earnings from operations” is a supplemental financial measure that is not presented in accordance with GAAP and is calculated as PG&E Corporation's income available for common shareholders less items impacting comparability. “Items impacting comparability” represent items that management does not consider part of the normal course of operations and that affect comparability of financial results between periods. Such items are described in more detail, along with a reconciliation from earnings from operations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, in PG&E Corporation materials that present such measure. 3 Non-GAAP Information PG&E refers to the term “Adjusted EBITDA” in various places in this presentation.

extraordinary challenges relating to the 2017 and 2018 Northern California wildfires − While investigations remain ongoing, if PG&E were to be found liable, the liability could be significant − Following a comprehensive review with the assistance of outside advisors, the boards of directors of the Corporation and the Utility have determined that commencing reorganization cases under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”) is appropriate, necessary and in the best interests of all stakeholders, including wildfire claimants, PG&E's other creditors and shareholders, and is ultimately the only viable option to restore PG&E's financial stability to fund ongoing operations and provide safe service to customers − PG&E expects that the Chapter 11 process will, among other things: • enable continued safe delivery of natural gas and electric service to PG&E's millions of customers, • support the orderly, fair and expeditious resolution of PG&E's potential liabilities resulting from the 2017 and 2018 Northern California wildfires, • enable PG&E to continue its extensive restoration and rebuilding efforts to assist communities affected by the 2017 and 2018 Northern California wildfires, • allow PG&E to work with regulators and policymakers to determine the most effective way for customers to receive safe natural gas and electric service for the long term in an environment that continues to be challenged by climate change, and • assure PG&E has access to the financial resources necessary to support ongoing operations and enable PG&E to continue investing in its systems, infrastructure and critical safety efforts Ÿ PG&E is seeking $5.5 billion of DIP financing to fund operations, required investments and safety initiatives, as well as the Chapter 11

2017 and 2018 Northern California Wildfires Recent Wildfires Overview 2017 Northern California Wildfires • According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s (“Cal Fire”) California Statewide Fire Summary dated October 30, 2017, at the peak of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, there were 21 major fires that, in total, resulted in 44 fatalities, burned over 245,000 acres and destroyed an estimated 8,900 structures • Cal Fire issued its determination on the causes of 18 of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, and alleged that each of these fires involved the Utility's equipment. The remaining wildfires remain under Cal Fire’s investigation, including the possible role of the Utility’s power lines and other facilities 2017 fires 2018 Camp Wildfire (“Camp Fire”) • Cal Fire’s Camp Fire Incident Information Website as of January 4, 2019 (the “Cal Fire website”), indicated that the Camp Fire consumed 153,336 acres. On the Cal Fire website, Cal Fire reported 86 fatalities and the destruction of 13,972 residences, 528 commercial structures and 4,293 other buildings resulting from the Camp Fire • The cause of the Camp Fire remains under investigation, and PG&E is cooperating with those investigations. The Utility has submitted two Electric Incident Reports (the “EIRs”) to the CPUC, one on November 8, 2018 and one on November 16, 2018. On December 11, 2018, the Utility publicly released a letter to the CPUC supplementing the EIRs Inverse Condemnation Overview 2018 fires • If the Utility's facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the substantial cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys' fees without having been found negligent – Courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from such undertaking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers IC – California courts have determined that the doctrine of inverse condemnation is applicable regardless of whether the CPUC ultimately allows recovery by the Utility for any such costs Third Party Claims & Potential Losses in Connection with 2017 and 2018 Northern California Wildfires • The dollar amounts announced by the California Department of Insurance represent an aggregate amount of approximately $17 billion of insurance claims made as of December 12, 2018 for the Camp Fire and as of September 6, 2018 for the 2017 Northern California wildfires Losses – PG&E expects that additional claims have been submitted and will continue to be submitted to insurers, particularly with respect to the Camp Fire. These claims reflect insured property losses only – The scope of all claims related to the 2017 and 2018 Northern California wildfires is not known at this time because of the applicable statutes of limitations under California law • PG&E has approximately $840 million of insurance coverage for liabilities, including wildfire events, for the period from August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018. During the third quarter of 2018, PG&E renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion for the period from August 1, Insurance 2018 through July 31, 2019 • If PG&E were to be found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses and other losses described herein with respect to the 2017 and 2018 Northern California wildfires, the amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion, which amount does not include potential punitive damages, fines and penalties or damages related to future claims. 8 2017 and 2018 Northern California Wildfires Recent Wildfires Overview 2017 Northern California Wildfires • According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s (“Cal Fire”) California Statewide Fire Summary dated October 30, 2017, at the peak of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, there were 21 major fires that, in total, resulted in 44 fatalities, burned over 245,000 acres and destroyed an estimated 8,900 structures • Cal Fire issued its determination on the causes of 18 of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, and alleged that each of these fires involved the Utility's equipment.

Highlights of Senate Bill 901 On September 21, 2018, California's governor signed legislation to strengthen California's ability to prevent and recover from catastrophic wildfires, including SB 901. Highlights below: • Imposing more restrictive forest management practices and providing support and incentives to facilitate forest management • Providing factors that the CPUC should consider when it conducts a review of the reasonableness of costs and expenses arising from a catastrophic SB 901: wildfire occurring on or after January 1, 2019 • In applications for cost recovery in connection with the 2017 wildfires, directing the CPUC to consider the electric corporation's financial status and https://www.bamsec.c determine the maximum amount a utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe service, and ensuring that the costs or expenses that are disallowed for recovery in rates assessed for the wildfires, in the aggregate, do not exceed that om/filing/1004980180 amount • Authorizing the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through issuance of recovery bonds (securitization), of wildfire-related costs 00015/1?cik=100498 found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 wildfires, any amounts in excess of the maximum disallowance (see above). Securitization is available, for prudently incurred costs, for the 2017 wildfires and catastrophic wildfires occurring on or after January 1, 2019, not for fires 0&hl=231116:231132 that occurred in 2018, including the Camp Fire &hl_id=4kce0o_f8 • Based on the CPUC's interpretation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&E believes that any securitization of costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires would not occur, if at all, until: – PG&E has paid claims relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, – PG&E has filed application for recovery of such costs and – the CPUC makes a determination that such costs are just and reasonable or in excess of the maximum disallowance • PG&E therefore does not expect the CPUC to permit PG&E to securitize costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires on an expedited or emergency basis • Based on the OIR, as well as prior experience and precedent, and unless the CPUC alters the position expressed in the OIR, PG&E believes it likely would take years to obtain authorization to securitize any amounts relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires • Requiring electric corporations to prepare and submit to the CPUC a wildfire mitigation plan. Among other things, the plan will include a description of the preventive strategies and programs of electric corporations that are designed to minimize the risk of their electrical lines and equipment causing catastrophic wildfires and protocols related to plan activities. Failure to substantially comply with such plan will result in penalties. The CPUC will consider whether the cost of implementing the plan is just and reasonable in each electric corporation's GRC • Establishing a Commission on Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery to evaluate wildfire reforms, including inverse condemnation reform, a potential state wildfire insurance fund, and other wildfire mitigation measures 10 Highlights of Senate Bill 901 On September 21, 2018, California's governor signed legislation to strengthen California's ability to prevent and recover from catastrophic wildfires, including SB 901.
