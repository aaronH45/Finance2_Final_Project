The SCE&G Any and All Settlement Date is the date that SCE&G accepts for purchase SCE&G Any and All Bonds validly tendered and not withdrawn at or prior to the SCE&G Any and All Expiration Time, provided that all applicable conditions have been satisfied or waived by SCE&G. SCE&G expects such date to be the business day following the SCE&G Any and All Expiration Time.  

The SCE&G Waterfall Offer  

The SCE&G Waterfall Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 18, 2019, unless extended or earlier terminated by SCE&G (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the SCE&G Waterfall Expiration Time). Holders of SCE&G Waterfall Bonds must validly tender and not properly withdraw their SCE&G Waterfall Bonds at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 4, 2019, unless extended by

Any SCE&G Waterfall Bonds validly tendered after the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Deadline but prior to or at the SCE&G Waterfall Expiration Time will be eligible to receive only the applicable Late Tender Offer Consideration (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), plus accrued interest. Validly tendered SCE&G Waterfall Bonds may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 4, 2019, unless extended by SCE&G (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the SCE&G Waterfall Withdrawal Deadline), but not thereafter.  

Subject to the SCE&G Waterfall Cap, SCE&G Waterfall Bonds will be accepted for purchase based on the acceptance priority levels set forth in the table above (such priority levels, the SCE&G Waterfall Acceptance Priority Levels). If the SCE&G Waterfall Offer is not fully subscribed as of the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Deadline, all SCE&G Waterfall Bonds validly tendered prior to or at the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Deadline will have priority over any SCE&G Waterfall Bonds validly tendered after the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Deadline, regardless of the SCE&G Waterfall Acceptance Priority Level of such bonds (such priority, the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Priority). Furthermore, if the SCE&G Waterfall Offer is fully subscribed as of the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Deadline, Holders who tender their SCE&G Waterfall Bonds following the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Deadline will not have any of their SCE&G Waterfall Bonds accepted for purchase. SCE&G Waterfall Bonds of a given series may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount of such SCE&G Waterfall Bonds validly tendered would cause the SCE&G Waterfall Cap to be exceeded. Series of SCE&G Waterfall Bonds that share the same SCE&G Waterfall Acceptance Priority Level will be treated equally (as though they constitute a single series of SCE&G Waterfall Bonds) for purposes of acceptance and proration, subject to the priority given to any such SCE&G& Waterfall Bonds validly tendered prior to or at the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Deadline.  

The SCE&G Waterfall Early Settlement Date is the date that SCE&G accepts for purchase SCE&G Waterfall Bonds validly tendered and not withdrawn at or prior to the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Deadline and the SCE&G Waterfall Final Settlement Date is the date that SCE&G accepts for purchase SCE&G Waterfall Bonds validly tendered after the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Deadline but prior to or at the SCE&G Waterfall Expiration Time, if any, provided, in each case, that all applicable conditions have been satisfied or waived by SCE&G. SCE&G currently expects the SCE&G Waterfall Early Settlement Date and the SCE&G Waterfall Final Settlement Date to be the second business day following the SCE&G Waterfall Early Tender Deadline and SCE&G Waterfall Expiration Time, respectively.  

The SCANA Offer  

The SCANA Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 18, 2019, unless extended or earlier terminated by SCANA (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the SCANA Expiration Time). Holders of SCANA Notes must validly tender and not properly withdraw their SCANA Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 4, 2019, unless extended by SCANA (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the SCANA Early Tender Deadline), to be eligible to receive, subject to the SCANA Offer Cap and proration, as applicable, the applicable Total Consideration, which includes the applicable Early Tender Premium (as set forth in the table above), plus accrued interest. SCANA Notes tendered after the SCANA Early Tender Deadline but prior to or at the SCANA Expiration Time will only be eligible to receive, subject to the SCANA Offer Cap and proration, as applicable, the applicable Late Tender Offer Consideration plus accrued interest.

SCANA will accept for purchase only SCANA Notes in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in an aggregate purchase price for such notes that exceeds the SCANA Offer Cap. SCANA reserves the right, but is   

 under no obligation to, increase the SCANA Offer Cap in its sole and absolute discretion without extending the SCANA Offer Withdrawal Deadline or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights, except as required by applicable law. Validly tendered SCANA Notes may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount of such SCANA Notes would cause the SCANA Offer Cap to be exceeded. If the SCANA Offer is fully subscribed as of the SCANA Early Tender Deadline, Holders who tender their SCANA Notes following the SCANA Early Tender Deadline will not have any of their SCANA Notes accepted for purchase. Each series of SCANA Notes will be treated equally (as though they constitute a single series of SCANA Notes) for purposes of acceptance and proration, subject to the priority given to any such SCANA Notes validly tendered prior to or at the SCANA Early Tender Deadline.  

The SCANA Early Settlement Date is the date that SCANA accepts for purchase SCANA Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn at or prior to the SCANA Early Tender Deadline, and the SCANA Final Settlement Date is the date that SCANA accepts for purchase SCANA Notes validly tendered after the SCANA Early Tender Deadline but prior to or at the SCANA Expiration Time, if any, provided, in each case, that all applicable conditions have been satisfied or waived by SCANA.
