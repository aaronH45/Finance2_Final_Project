PG&E Corporation and the Utility also routinely post or provide direct links to presentations, documents, and other information that may be of interest to investors at http://investor.pgecorp.com, under the “News & Events: Events & Presentations” tab and links to certain documents and information related to the 2018 Camp fire, 2017 Northern California wildfires, and 2015 Butte fire which may be of interest to investors, at http://investor.pgecorp.com, under the “Wildfire Updates” tab, in order to publicly disseminate such information.

On February 28, 2019, PG&E Corporation provided an update on the expected financial impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires as part of the announcement of its full year and fourth quarter 2018 financial results. Although the cause of the 2018 Camp fire is still under investigation, based on the information currently known to PG&E Corporation and reported to the CPUC and other agencies, PG&E Corporation believes it is probable that the Utility’s equipment will be determined to be an ignition point of the 2018 Camp fire.
