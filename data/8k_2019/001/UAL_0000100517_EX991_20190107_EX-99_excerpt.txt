United Airlines to Hold Live Webcast of

Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Financial Results

CHICAGO, Jan. 7, 2019â€“ United Airlines will hold a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 financial results on Wednesday, January 16, at 9:30 a.m. CT/10:30 a.m. ET. A live, listen-only webcast of the conference call will be available at ir.united.com. The company will issue its fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 financial results and first-quarter 2019 investor update after market close on Tuesday, January 15.

Notable Special Charges

For fourth quarter 2018, the company expects to record a special non-cash impairment charge of $206 million ($160 million net of taxes) associated with its Hong Kong routes. The company conducted its annual impairment review of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2018, which consisted of a comparison of the book value of specific assets to the fair value of those assets calculated using the discounted cash flow method. Due to increased costs without sufficient corresponding increases in revenue in the Hong Kong market, the company determined that the value of its Hong Kong routes had been impaired. The collateral pledged under the company's term loan, including the Hong Kong routes, continues to be sufficient to satisfy the loan covenants. 

The company expects to also record a one-time termination fee with a present value of $64 million ($50 million net of tax) related to one of its engine maintenance service agreements.
