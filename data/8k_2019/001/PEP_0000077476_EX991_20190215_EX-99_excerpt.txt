Organic/Core (non-GAAP)1 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

PURCHASE, N.Y. - February 15, 2019 - PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.

“We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2018. For the year we met or exceeded each of the financial objectives we set out at the beginning of the year. Frito-Lay North America and each of our international sectors performed very well, and our North America Beverages sector made progress throughout the year,” said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta. “While adverse foreign exchange translation negatively impacted reported net revenue performance, our underlying organic revenue growth accelerated in the second half, and we ended the year with 4.6% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, we are excited about the outlook for our business. We are well positioned in large, growing categories and have developed strong and relevant capabilities over the years. In 2019, we aim to capitalize on the momentum we have as we enter the year, and to continue to invest in the capabilities that will better position us for success for years to come.

“For 2019, we expect 4% organic revenue growth and approximately 1% decline in core constant currency EPS. Our 2019 EPS performance is expected to be impacted by incremental investments that are intended to further strengthen the business, lapping a number of 2018 strategic asset-sale and refranchising gains and an increased core effective tax rate in 2019. Importantly, we expect to return to high-single-digit core constant currency EPS growth in 2020.”

PepsiCo provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange and commodity mark-to-market adjustments.

◦restructuring charges, and 

◦commodity mark-to-market net impacts. 

•Reported net revenue was even with the prior year. Foreign exchange translation had a 4-percentage-point unfavorable impact on reported net revenue performance and acquisitions and divestitures had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.

The impact of merger and integration charges related to the acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) and the prior year gain from the refranchising of a portion of our bottling operations in Jordan negatively impacted reported operating profit performance by 3 percentage points and 5 percentage points, respectively. A gain from the refranchising of our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia (CHS) positively impacted reported operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced reported operating profit performance by 3 percentage points.

•The reported effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 was (254.8) percent and the core effective tax rate was 17.9 percent. The reported and core effective tax rates in the fourth quarter of 2017 were 129.8 and 25.0 percent, respectively. The fourth quarter 2018 reported effective tax rate reflects net tax benefits of $5.3 billion, collectively, associated with net tax benefits resulting from the reorganization of our international operations, a net tax benefit related to the TCJ Act and a non-cash state tax benefit from the 2012 and 2013 audit resolution. The fourth quarter 2017 reported effective tax rate reflects the impact of the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion as a result of

Discussion of Fourth Quarter 2018 Reported Division Results:

Frito-Lay North America (FLNA)

Operating profit grew 8%, reflecting net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases.

Quaker Foods North America (QFNA)

Operating profit grew 5%, reflecting productivity savings and lower advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. 

North America Beverages (NAB)

Operating profit declined 12%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including increased transportation costs, a 9-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 4-percentage-point impact of prior-year hurricane-related costs.

Latin America 

Operating profit grew 9%, reflecting effective net pricing and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 20-percentage-point impact of primarily foreign exchange-driven higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 6 percentage points.

Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA)

Operating profit grew 23%, reflecting effective net pricing, productivity savings, volume growth, a 15-percentage-point net impact of refranchising our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS and a 6-percentage-point impact of the sale of a portion of our water business in Russia. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 19-percentage-point impact of primarily foreign exchange-driven higher commodity costs. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 15 percentage points.

Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA)

Operating profit declined 46%, reflecting a 45-percentage-point impact of refranchising a portion of our Jordan beverage business in 2017, certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and effective net pricing.

Discussion of Full-Year 2018 Reported Division Results:

Frito-Lay North America (FLNA)

Operating profit grew 4.5%, primarily reflecting net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 1-percentage-point impact of a bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act.

Quaker Foods North America (QFNA)

Operating profit decreased slightly, reflecting certain operating cost increases, net revenue performance and a 3-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and a 1-percentage-point positive contribution from insurance settlement recoveries related to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico.

North America Beverages (NAB)

Operating profit decreased 16%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including increased transportation costs, a 7-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and net revenue growth. Higher gains on asset sales positively contributed 1.5 percentage points to operating profit performance. A bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act negatively impacted operating profit performance by 1.5 percentage points and was partially offset by prior-year costs related to hurricanes which positively contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit performance.

Latin America 

Operating profit increased 13%, reflecting net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 4-percentage-point impact of insurance settlement recoveries related to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 14-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses.

Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA)

Operating profit increased 4%, reflecting net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 4-percentage-point net impact of refranchising our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. Additionally, a prior-year 

8

gain on the sale of our minority stake in Britvic and the merger and integration charges related to our acquisition of SodaStream reduced operating profit growth by 7 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively.

Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA)

Operating profit grew 9%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing, productivity savings and net volume growth, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. The net impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Thailand in 2018 contributed 13 percentage points to operating profit growth and was offset by a 16-percentage-point negative impact of the prior-year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Jordan.

Dividend Increase

The Company today announced a 3 percent increase in its annualized dividend per share to $3.82 from $3.71 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2019. This represents the Company’s 47th consecutive annual dividend per share increase. 

Guidance and Outlook

The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and commodity mark-to-market impacts.

For 2019, the Company expects: 

•Full-year organic revenue growth to be 4 percent.

•A core effective tax rate of approximately 21 percent, which compares to a rate of 18.8 percent in 2018.

•A decline in core constant currency EPS of approximately 1 percent, which incorporates lapping a number of 2018 strategic asset-sale and refranchising gains, the expected increased core effective tax rate, and expected 2019 incremental investments to strengthen the business.

•Approximately $9 billion in cash from operating activities and free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, which assumes net capital spending of approximately $4.5 billion.

•Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8 billion, comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3 billion.

Applying current market consensus rates implies a 2 percentage point foreign exchange translation headwind to both reported net revenue and EPS performance. This assumption and the guidance above implies 2019 core earnings per share of $5.50, a 3 percent decrease compared to 2018 core earnings per share of $5.66.

The Company expects long-term financial performance of:

•4 to 6 percent organic revenue growth,

•core operating margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points,

•high-single-digit core constant currency EPS growth, and

•increasing core net returns on invested capital

The Company expects to generate productivity savings of at least $1 billion annually through 2023 (an extension of the Company’s previous target of $1 billion annual savings through the end of 2019). Contributing to the productivity goal are expected savings from certain restructuring actions that are intended to enable the Company to leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with these restructuring actions, the Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion through 2023 (of which the cash portion is approximately $1.6 billion).

Non-GAAP Measures

In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): division operating profit, core results, core constant currency results, free cash flow, free cash flow excluding certain items, organic results and return on invested capital (ROIC). We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. 

We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring programs; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; gains or losses associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; pension and retiree medical related items; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures included herein. 

Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

Glossary

We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:

Acquisitions and divestitures: All mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.

Beverage volume: Volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our bottlers.

Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.

Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:

Commodity mark-to-market net impact

Change in market value for commodity derivatives that we purchase to mitigate the volatility in costs of energy and raw materials that we consume. The market value is determined based on average prices on national exchanges and recently reported transactions in the marketplace.

In the quarter and year ended December 29, 2018, we recognized $106 million and $163 million of mark-to-market net losses, respectively, on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. In the quarter and year ended December 30, 2017, we recognized $28 million and $15 million of mark-to-market net gains, respectively, on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.

A - 6

Restructuring and impairment charges

2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan

In the quarter and year ended December 29, 2018, we incurred restructuring charges of $138 million (recorded $3 million in cost of sales, $100 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $35 million in other pension and retiree medical benefits expense) in conjunction with the multi-year plan we publicly announced on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan). 

The 2019 Productivity Plan will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint.

2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan

In the quarter and year ended December 29, 2018, we incurred restructuring charges of $91 million (recorded $94 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $3 million in other pension and retiree medical benefits income) and $170 million (recorded $169 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $1 million in other pension and retiree medical benefits expense), respectively, in conjunction with the multi-year productivity plan we publicly announced in 2014 (2014 Productivity Plan). In the quarter and year ended December 30, 2017, we incurred restructuring charges of $226 million (recorded $164 in selling, general and administrative expenses and $62 million in other pension and retiree medical benefits expense) and $295 million (recorded $229 in selling, general and administrative expenses and $66 million in other pension and retiree medical benefits expense), respectively, in conjunction with our 2014 Productivity Plan. 

The 2014 Productivity Plan includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above to further strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses. 

Merger and integration charges

In the quarter and year ended December 29, 2018, we incurred merger and integration charges of $75 million related to our acquisition of SodaStream, including $57 million recorded in the ESSA segment and $18 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses. These charges include closing costs, advisory fees and employee-related costs.

Net tax (benefit)/expense related to the TCJ Act 

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. 

In the quarter and year ended December 30, 2017, we recorded a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act. Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion was a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4 billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This mandatory one-time transition tax was partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate.  

In the quarter and year ended December 29, 2018, we recorded a net tax benefit of $882 million and $28 million, respectively, in connection with the TCJ Act. 

While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The IRS issued additional guidance in the first quarter of 2019 and we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance.

A - 7

Other net tax benefits

In the quarter and year ended December 29, 2018, we recorded other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion related to the reorganization of our international operations. Additionally, in the quarter and year ended December 29, 2018, we recorded non-cash tax benefits of $39 million and $717 million, respectively, associated with both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. 

Charges related to cash tender and exchange offers

In the quarter and year ended December 29, 2018, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253 million to interest expense in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes.

Division operating profit: The aggregation of the operating profit for each of our reportable segments, which excludes the impact of corporate unallocated expenses.

Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.

Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.

Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.

Free cash flow excluding certain items: Free cash flow, excluding payments related to restructuring charges, discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions and the related net cash tax benefits associated with both these items, tax payments related to the TCJ Act, as well as certain other items. As free cash flow, excluding certain items, is an important measure used to monitor our cash flow performance, we believe this non-GAAP measure provides investors additional useful information when evaluating our cash from operating activities. See below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP (operating cash flow). In future years, we expect this measure to exclude additional payments related to the mandatory transition tax liability of $3.8 billion as of December 29, 2018, which we currently expect to be paid over the period 2019 to 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act.

Net capital spending: Capital spending less cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.

Organic: A measure that adjusts for impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Additionally, our fiscal 2018 reported results reflect the accounting policy election taken in conjunction with the adoption of the revenue recognition guidance to exclude from net revenue and cost of sales all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions not already excluded. Our 2018 fiscal year organic revenue growth excludes the impact of approximately $75 million of these taxes previously recognized in net revenue.

ROIC and Core Net ROIC: ROIC is net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. This metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. Core net ROIC is ROIC adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income, and items that are not indicative of our ongoing performance. We believe the calculation of ROIC and core net ROIC provide useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency. 

2019 guidance and long-term financial performance targets

Our 2019 organic revenue growth guidance and our long-term organic revenue growth target exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2019 core tax rate guidance, our 2019 core constant currency EPS performance guidance, our long-term core constant currency EPS growth target and our long-term core operating margin expansion target exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses and restructuring and impairment charges. Our 2019 core constant currency EPS performance guidance and long-term core constant currency EPS growth target also exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation.

in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2019 core tax rate to our full year projected 2019 reported tax rate, our full year projected 2019 or long-term core constant currency EPS performance to our full year projected 2019 and long-term reported EPS performance or our long-term core operating margin performance to our long-term reported operating margin performance because we are unable to predict the 2019 and long-term impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
