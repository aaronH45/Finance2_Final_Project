Annual GAAP Diluted EPS of $1.90 and Record Adjusted Diluted EPS of $2.81

Full-Year 2019 Guidance Reflects Expected Growth in Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, EPS & Cash Flow  

HOUSTON – Feb. 21, 2019 - Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 were a record $3.11 billion, compared to revenues of $2.48 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, and net income attributable to common stock was $56.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to net income attributable to common stock of $113.6 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $0.96 for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $0.45 for the fourth quarter of 2017.  

“Quanta’s fourth quarter results capped off another record year, demonstrated by the highest levels of annual revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and backlog in the company’s history. With end market drivers firmly in place and high demand for specialized skilled labor and our services, we continue to believe we are well positioned for a multi-year growth cycle in our base business and for larger projects when they occur,” said Duke Austin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quanta Services. “Our outlook for 2019 reflects improved profitability and growth in adjusted EBITDA, earnings per share and cash flow. We are executing on our strategic growth initiatives, which, coupled with our strong financial profile, positions us well to deliver value to stockholders. To that end, during 2018, Quanta repurchased approximately $451 million of its common stock and initiated a quarterly cash dividend, demonstrating our continued confidence in the stability of Quanta’s base business and long-term growth prospects.”  

Certain items that impacted the fourth quarter of 2018 are reflected as adjustments in the calculation of Quanta’s adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock and are further described in the reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock. The net unfavorable impact of these items was $70.0 million net of tax, or $0.46 per diluted share. Certain of these items included asset impairments of $49.4 million ($36.5

 million net of tax), or $0.24 per diluted share, related to the winding down of certain oil influenced operations and assets, and net tax charges of $36.0 million, or $0.24 per share, primarily related to recently issued regulations associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act).  

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS  

   •    

East-West Tie Transmission Line Project Confirmed - In February 2019, the Ontario Energy Board designated NextBridge Infrastructure’s East-West Tie Line Transmission Project as the selected project to move forward, which Quanta was previously selected to construct. Quanta expects the majority of construction on the project to occur in 2020 and 2021, with completion expected in late 2021. Quanta’s scope of work on the project includes comprehensive construction services for approximately 290 miles of high-voltage electric transmission line in Ontario, Canada. This project has been included in backlog since the contract was signed in the fourth quarter of 2017.  

   •    

Increasing Exposure to Delaware Basin Through Investment in WhiteWater - In February 2019, funds affiliated with First Infrastructure Capital, L.P., Quanta’s partnership with select third party investors, agreed to acquire WhiteWater Midstream, LLC (WhiteWater), which has a significant interest in the Agua Blanca natural gas pipeline system in the Delaware Basin, consisting of 160 miles of 36” diameter and smaller diameter pipeline. Quanta anticipates supporting WhiteWater’s expansion plans, including the further build-out of the Agua Blanca pipeline system, as well as other planned infrastructure projects originating in the Delaware Basin.  

   •    

Stock Repurchased - During the fourth quarter of 2018, Quanta repurchased $233.6 million of its outstanding common stock in the open market, acquiring 7.7 million shares. With these repurchases, Quanta acquired a total of 13.9 million shares of its common stock for $451.3 million during 2018 and had approximately $298.7 million of availability remaining under its current stock repurchase authorization at December 31, 2018.  

   •    

Quarterly Dividend Initiated - During the fourth quarter of 2018, Quanta announced an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share, a rate of $0.16 per share on an annualized basis, which was paid in January 2019. The decision to initiate a dividend demonstrates continued confidence in the stability of Quanta’s base business, long-term growth prospects, solid financial position and commitment to enhancing stockholder value.  

RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017  

Revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 were a record $11.17 billion, compared to revenues of $9.47 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017, and net income attributable to common stock was $293.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, or $1.90 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common stock of $315.0 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was a record $2.81 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.97 for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

Quanta completed four acquisitions during 2018 and three acquisitions during 2017. Therefore, Quanta’s results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included the results of the acquired businesses from their respective acquisition dates. For further information on the items that impacted comparability in 2018 and 2017, see the footnotes to the Supplemental Segment Data table and the non-GAAP reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock below.

SEGMENT NAME CHANGE  

As of December 31, 2018, Quanta changed the name of its Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment to Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services. There was no change to the composition of the segment, and the name change was made to better reflect the work performed within the segment and the diversity of its service offerings.  

OUTLOOK  

The long-term outlook for Quanta’s business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, project timing, execution challenges and other factors have impacted the company’s historical results, and may impact Quanta’s future financial results. Therefore, Quanta’s financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management’s effort to properly align these uncertainties with the backlog the company is executing on and the opportunities expected to materialize during 2019. The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially.  

Prior to the company’s conference call, management will post a summary of 2019 guidance expectations with additional commentary in the “Investors & Media” section of Quanta’s website at http://investors.quantaservices.com.  

Quanta expects 2019 revenues to range between $10.8 billion and $11.2 billion. Several items are noteworthy when comparing the company’s 2019 guidance with 2018 results. Quanta’s 2019 guidance includes estimated emergency restoration revenues of $100 million (based on historical averages), as compared to emergency restoration revenues of $241 million in 2018, and a limited amount of estimated work to be performed for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project due to uncertainty as to when the project may resume construction. Further, the Fort McMurray West Transmission Line project in Alberta, Canada, which provided a significant amount of revenues during 2018, is expected to reach completion in the coming months. Despite these headwinds of over $1 billion on expected 2019 revenues, net income attributable to common stock is expected to range between $407 million and $473 million, and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is expected to range between $2.76 and $3.21. Quanta expects adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) to range between $3.30 and $3.75. Included in Quanta’s GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share expectations is the recognition of approximately $0.30 per share of earnings related to the accounting treatment of previously deferred income for the Fort McMurray West electric transmission project. The project is expected to be completed and placed in commercial operation in the first half of 2019, which will result in the recognition of previously deferred profit that had been reflected in Other Expense on the company’s statement of operations. EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) is expected to be between $816 million and $916 million, and adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) is expected to be between $875 million and $975 million. See the tables below for reconciliations of estimated adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to estimated GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the full-year 2019 and estimated EBITDA and estimated adjusted EBITDA to estimated GAAP net income attributable to common stock for the full-year 2019.

IMPACT OF NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING IMPLEMENTATION  

Effective January 1, 2019, Quanta Services will adopt the provisions of the new lease accounting standard (ASC 842). Quanta’s current assessment estimates that the impact of adopting ASC 842 will be primarily limited to its balance sheet and will result in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019 that are expected to be in the range of approximately $280 million to $320 million. Quanta will also continue to have short-term leases that are not recorded on its balance sheet. Quanta does not expect a material impact to its operating results, net earnings or borrowing capacity as a result of ASC 842. However, the assessment is not final, and our estimate of the impact of ASC 842 could change.  

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The non-GAAP measures in this press release are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta’s performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta’s operating results with those of its competitors. These measures should be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, results prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).

Segment Results  

Quanta reports its results under two reportable segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services and (2) Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services, as set forth below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

Included in operating income for the Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 were asset impairment charges of $49.4 million and $52.7 million primarily related to the winding down of certain oil influenced operations and assets. Additionally, included in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was the impact of $1.3 million in severance and restructuring costs related to the closure of certain operations. Included in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was a $1.9 million charge to expense associated with the planned sale of a construction barge, which ultimately was not consummated.

Supplemental Remaining Performance Obligations and 

Backlog Data 

(In millions) 

(Unaudited)    

Remaining Performance Obligations and Backlog (a non-GAAP measure)  

Quanta’s remaining performance obligations represent management’s estimate of consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the remaining portion of firm orders for fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work has not yet begun. For purposes of calculating remaining performance obligations, Quanta includes all estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities, revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to occur and revenues from change orders to the extent management believes additional contract revenues will be earned and are deemed probable of collection.  

While backlog is not a defined term under GAAP, it is a common measurement used in Quanta’s industry. Quanta believes this non-GAAP measure enables it to more effectively forecast its future results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Quanta’s remaining performance obligations, as described above, are a component of Quanta’s backlog calculation, which also includes estimated orders under master service agreements (MSAs), including estimated renewals, and non-fixed price contracts expected to be completed within one year. Quanta’s methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.  

The following table reconciles Quanta’s total remaining performance obligations to its backlog (a non-GAAP measure) by reportable segment as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018, along with estimates of amounts expected to be realized within 12 months of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018:

The non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, when used in connection with diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net income attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. As to certain of the items below, (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s ongoing acquisition activity; (iv) asset impairment charges and severance and restructuring costs can vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors; (v) changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities vary from period to period depending on the forecasted performance of certain acquired businesses; (vi) items related to the Tax Act vary from period to period based on changes to our provisional analysis within the one-year measurement period and as more information, including proposed regulations, becomes available; (vii) income tax contingency releases vary period to period depending on the level of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the expiration dates under various federal and state tax statute of limitations periods; and (viii) income tax items related to entity restructuring and recapitalization efforts can vary period to period depending on operational realignments, economic factors, acquisition activity and as more information, including proposed regulations related to the Tax Act, becomes available. Because adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, as defined, excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock as presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 reflect the elimination of asset impairment charges related to the winding down of certain oil influenced operations and assets, and the amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 also reflects a loss related to the exchange of a construction barge for an industrial property. These charges relate to Quanta’s Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment. The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflect the elimination of asset impairment charges associated with goodwill related to two reporting units within our Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services Division. Additionally, included in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was the elimination of a previous $1.9 million charge associated with a planned sale of the construction barge mentioned above, which ultimately was not consummated, and also related to Quanta’s Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment. Although this charge was disclosed in connection with Quanta’s 2017 second quarter results, it was not reflected as an adjustment to GAAP reported results during 2017.The adjustment is reflected above to be comparable to the current period presentation.  

 (b)  

The amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 reflects the elimination of severance and restructuring costs related to the closure of certain operations within Quanta’s Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment.  

 (c)  

The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 reflect the elimination of the adjustments to our provisional estimate recorded related to the impact of the Tax Act. The adjustments primarily relate to refinements of Quanta’s prior estimates and assumptions in connection with filing its 2017 income tax returns and based on regulations issued in connection with the Tax Act. Although Quanta completed its accounting for the effect of the Tax Act within the prescribed one-year measurement period ended on December 22, 2018, it expects further regulations to be issued that could have a material impact on its effective tax rate in future periods. The amount for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 reflects the elimination of the net tax benefits related to the Tax Act, which among other things, lowered the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, required payment of a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, limits and eliminates certain tax deductions and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. The amount includes $85.3 million of tax benefits associated with the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by an estimated $15.2 million transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.  

 (d)  

The amounts reflect the releases of tax contingencies upon expiration of certain statute of limitations periods.  

 (e)  

The amounts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 reflect the elimination of the income tax impact primarily related to entity restructuring and recapitalization efforts.  

 (f)  

The income tax impact of adjustments that are subject to tax is determined using the incremental statutory tax rates of the jurisdictions to which each adjustment relates for the respective periods.  

 (g)  

Both diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were impacted by attorneys’ fees and related expenses of approximately $4.2 million ($2.7 million net of tax), or $0.02 per share, associated with certain litigation that was resolved in the first quarter of 2017 and a $2.4 million ($1.7 million net of tax), or $0.01 per share, charitable contribution made in connection with the formation and funding of a non-profit line school.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following table presents the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which when used in connection with net income attributable to common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. EBITA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates and certain other items as described below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stock or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net income attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent when including the excluded items. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; (ii) equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates can vary from period to period depending on the activity and financial performance of unconsolidated affiliates, including deferral of a portion of the earnings on a large construction contract performed for an affiliate in which Quanta has an equity interest and that will be recognized upon completion of the project; (iii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (iv) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s ongoing acquisition activity; (v) severance and restructuring costs and asset impairment charges can vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors; and (vi) changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities vary from period to period depending on the forecasted performance of certain acquired businesses. Because EBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.

 (a)  

The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 reflect the elimination of asset impairment charges related to the winding down of certain oil influenced operations and assets, and the amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 also reflects a loss related to the exchange of a construction barge for an industrial property. These charges relate to Quanta’s Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment. The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflect the elimination of asset impairment charges associated with goodwill related to two reporting units within our Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services Division. Additionally, included in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was the elimination of a previous $1.9 million charge associated with a planned sale of the construction barge mentioned above, which ultimately was not consummated and also related to Quanta’s Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment. Although this charge was disclosed in connection with Quanta’s 2017 second quarter results, it was not reflected as an adjustment to EBITDA during 2017. The adjustment is reflected above to be comparable to the current period presentation.  

 (b)  

The amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 reflects the elimination of severance and restructuring costs primarily related to the closure of certain operations within Quanta’s Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment.

Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow:  

The non-GAAP measure of free cash flow, when used in connection with net cash provided by operating activities, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s ability to generate the cash required to maintain and potentially expand its business. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures is defined as capital expenditures less proceeds from sale of property and equipment and proceeds from insurance settlements related to property and equipment. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to Quanta’s investors because free cash flow is viewed by management as an important indicator of how much cash is provided or used by routine business operations, including the impact of net capital expenditures. Management uses free cash flow for capital allocation purposes as it is viewed as a measure of cash available to pay debt, acquire businesses, repurchase common stock, declare and pay dividends and transact other investing and financing activities. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net cash provided by operating activities, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.

The non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, when used in connection with diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net income attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; and (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s ongoing acquisition activity. Because adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, as defined, excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock as presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included below.

The following table presents the non-GAAP financial measures of estimated EBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which, when used in connection with estimated net income attributable to common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. EBITA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates and certain other items as described below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stock or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net income attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent when including the excluded items. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; (ii) equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates can vary from period to period depending on the activity and financial performance of unconsolidated affiliates, including deferral of a portion of the earnings on a large construction contract performed by Quanta for an affiliate in which Quanta has an equity interest and the subsequent recognition upon completion of the project; (iii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; and (iv) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s ongoing acquisition activity.
