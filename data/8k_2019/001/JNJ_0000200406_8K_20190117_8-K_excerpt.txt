Item 8.01 Other Events.

As previously disclosed, on October 23, 2018, Johnson & Johnson entered into an agreement to acquire Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd. (TYO: 4924) (the “Company”) for a total purchase price of approximately ¥230 billion, which equates to approximately $2.1 billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar as of 5p.m., New York City time, on January 16, 2019. 

The acquisition was completed through a series of transactions that included an all-cash tender offer (the "tender offer") to acquire publicly held shares of the Company, not already held by Johnson & Johnson and its affiliates, for ¥5,900 per share. Upon completion of the tender offer and the related transactions, Johnson & Johnson acquired 89% of the outstanding shares of the Company. Johnson & Johnson plans to acquire the remaining shares of the Company that were not tendered in the tender offer through a share consolidation under Japanese law during the first half of 2019 and take appropriate actions to delist the Company from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The Company, which markets the Dr Ci:Labo, Labo Labo and Genomer line of skincare products, will now become part of the Johnson & Johnson Family of Consumer Companies.

Any EPS impact of the transaction will be included in the 2019 guidance provided on Johnson & Johnson’s Q4 2018 earnings call.

The related press release dated January 17, 2019 is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
