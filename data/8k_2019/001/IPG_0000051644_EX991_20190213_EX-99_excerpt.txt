Outlook

•The company said that, entering the new year, it continues to see opportunities for solid revenue increases, and is targeting 2019 organic growth of 2.0%-3.0%. The company is also targeting a further 40-50 basis points of improvement in full-year adjusted EBITA margin, on top of the 13.5% achieved in 2018. The margin target excludes an expected pre-tax charge to earnings of approximately $30-$40 million in the first quarter of 2019, to right-size its cost structure following certain accounts lost, mainly in the latter part of last year.

"Overall, 2018 was a very successful year, with outstanding financial results, coupled with a significant, future-facing acquisition. Our results again demonstrate the strength of our client-centric integrated offerings, and the quality of our people. We’re proud that our culture continues to attract diverse talent with a breadth of digital expertise, which has helped us to deliver leading organic growth and margin improvement in recent years. This is what’s required in light of the significant changes taking place in our industry and the environment in which we operate,” commented Michael Roth, Chairman and CEO of IPG. 

“As we turn to our outlook for 2019, we do so with a strong portfolio of agencies, across the full range of capabilities and marketing disciplines, competing successfully in the marketplace. This allows us to achieve revenue growth and convert it to operating profit at rates that have been leading the industry. Our 2019 targets are for fully competitive organic growth and solid underlying margin expansion. We also remain committed to our robust capital return program, as is evident in the action of our Board announced today to further increase our dividend. We are confident that this combination of operating performance and capital returns will allow us to build on our strong track record of enhancing shareholder value," Mr. Roth concluded.
