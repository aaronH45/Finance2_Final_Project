2019 Long Term Incentive Plan  

On February 6, 2019, the Organizational Development & Compensation Committee (“the Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Newell Brands Inc. (the “Company”) approved the 2019 Long Term Incentive Plan Terms and Conditions under the Company’s shareholder approved 2013 Incentive Plan (as amended, the “LTIP”), pursuant to which the Company makes annual long term incentive awards based on shares of the Company’s common stock, including restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Under the LTIP, the Committee (or in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, the independent members of the Board) makes time-based RSU and performance-based RSU awards to key employees, including the named executive officers. The value of the LTIP award is based upon a percentage of the named executive officer’s salary or other such dollar value as is determined by the Committee. Under the LTIP, a named executive officer’s LTIP award is comprised of 70 -100% of performance-based RSUs and 0-30% time based RSUs. Performance-based RSU awards under the LTIP vest three years from the date of grant conditional upon achievement of performance objectives and continued employment with the Company. Time-based RSU awards vest ratably in one-third increments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of the grant conditional upon continued employment with the Company. The performance-based RSUs awarded may vest at 0% to 200% depending upon the satisfaction of a total shareholder return performance and free cashflow criteria. A copy of the LTIP is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.  

Bonus Program  

On February 6, 2019, the Committee used its discretion under the Newell Brands Inc. Management Bonus Plan (the “Bonus Plan”) under the shareholder approved 2013 Incentive Plan to establish the performance criteria for the 2019 bonus awards. For each named executive officer, 2019 bonus awards will be tied to corporate performance goals previously approved by the Company’s shareholders, including adjusted operating cashflow, core sales growth and adjusted earnings per share. Following completion of 2019, named executive officers are eligible to receive a bonus equal to such named executive officer’s base salary multiplied by the product of the target payout percentage described below and the Aggregate Corporate Performance Bonus Multiplier (as defined below), in each case based on attainment of applicable corporate performance goals, and subject to adjustment up or down, based on individual performance, quality of results or other factors deemed relevant by the Committee.  

The “Aggregate Corporate Performance Bonus Multiplier” is a percentage from 0% to 200% determined by the Committee based on specified performance criteria for each applicable 2019 bonus award. The named executive officers participate in the 2019 Bonus Plan with a target payout equal to the percentage of their respective base salary as set forth below. In order to receive their bonuses, participants are generally required to continue to be employed by the Company through at least December 31, 2019. The amount awarded to a named executive officer under the Bonus Plan will range between 0% and 200% of the target payout indicated below, based on the extent to which applicable performance criteria are met.
