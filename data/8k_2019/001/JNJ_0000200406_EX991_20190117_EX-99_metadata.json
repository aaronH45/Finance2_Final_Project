        "This press release contains 'forward-looking statements' as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding the potential transaction between Johnson & Johnson and the Company. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations of future events. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of Johnson & Johnson and the Company. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the satisfaction of closing conditions for the transaction, including the receipt of regulatory approvals for the transaction; the tender of the requisite amount of the outstanding shares of the Company; the possibility that the transaction will not be completed in the expected timeframe or at all; the potential that the expected benefits and opportunities of the transaction, if completed, may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; uncertainty of commercial success for new and existing products; manufacturing difficulties and delays; economic conditions, including currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; changes to applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws and domestic and foreign health care reforms; adverse litigation or government action; changes in behavior and spending patterns or financial distress of purchasers of health care products and services; and trends toward health care cost containment. In addition, if and when the transaction is consummated, there will be risks and uncertainties related to the ability of the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies to successfully integrate the products, employees and operations of the Company, as well as the ability to ensure continued performance or market growth of the Companyâ€™s products. A further list and description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in Johnson & Johnson's publicly available filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of these filings, as well as subsequent filings, are available online at www.sec.gov, www.jnj.com or on request from Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information or future events or developments."
