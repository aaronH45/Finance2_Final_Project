The attached news release includes references to the following financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (non-GAAP measures): free cash flow and ratios based on free cash flow. The company believes these non-GAAP measures provide insight into its liquidity, cash generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into its financial performance.

Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the “Non-GAAP financial information” section of the news release.
