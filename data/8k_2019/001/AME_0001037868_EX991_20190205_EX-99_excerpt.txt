BERWYN, PA, FEBRUARY 5, 2019 – AMETEK, Inc. (NYSE: AME) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2018.  

AMETEK’s fourth quarter 2018 sales were a record $1.27 billion, up 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, with organic sales growth of 5%. Operating income increased 14% to a record $282.0 million, and operating margins expanded to 22.2%, up 50 basis points over the prior year’s adjusted results.  

On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.91. Excluding an after-tax gain of $11.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, related to the finalization of the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, fourth quarter earnings were $0.86 per diluted share, an increase of 23% over the prior year’s adjusted earnings. A reconciliation of reported GAAP results to adjusted results is included in the financial tables accompanying this release and on the AMETEK website.  

“AMETEK completed an outstanding year with record results in the fourth quarter,” said David A. Zapico, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our businesses again delivered strong organic sales growth and outstanding operating performance driving robust sales and earnings growth in the quarter.”  

“Additionally, our businesses continue to generate excellent levels of cash flow with operating cash flow in the fourth quarter a record $296 million,” added Mr. Zapico. “We remain focused on deploying our free cash flow on strategic acquisitions having deployed a record $1.1 billion of capital on acquisitions in 2018, including $750 million on three acquisitions in the fourth quarter. We also deployed $364 million on share repurchases in the quarter.”  

For the full year, AMETEK’s sales were a record $4.8 billion, an increase of 13% over 2017, and organic sales growth was 7%. Operating income in 2018 was a record $1.08 billion, up 16%, and operating income margins were 22.2%, expanding 70 basis points over 2017’s adjusted results.

On a GAAP basis, earnings were $3.34 per diluted share. Excluding the after-tax gain of $0.05 per diluted share, 2018 earnings were $3.29 per diluted share, a 26% increase over 2017’s adjusted earnings.  

Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)  

Fourth quarter EIG sales were a record $826.0 million, up 11% over the fourth quarter of 2017. EIG operating income was a record $214.6 million in the quarter, up 11% over the prior-year period’s adjusted results, and operating margins were 26.0%.  

“EIG finished the year with an outstanding fourth quarter, delivering excellent sales and operating income growth. In addition to solid organic growth and excellent operating performance, we completed five acquisitions across EIG in 2018,” noted Mr. Zapico.  

Electromechanical Group (EMG)  

EMG sales in the fourth quarter were $445.3 million, up 11% over the same quarter in 2017. EMG’s fourth quarter operating income was $85.8 million, an 18% increase, and operating margins were 19.3%, expanding 110 basis points over the prior year’s adjusted results.  

“EMG also capped the year with exceptional results in the fourth quarter. Sales grew by double digits on strong, broad-based organic sales growth and contributions from the acquisition of FMH Aerospace. EMG continues to deliver excellent results through our Operational Excellence initiatives, which resulted in a sharp increase in operating income during the quarter,” commented Mr. Zapico.  

2019 Outlook  

Going forward, AMETEK will report and provide guidance on an adjusted diluted earnings per share basis that adds back non-cash, after-tax, acquisition related intangible amortization. The company believes this non-GAAP measure provides investors with a better understanding of its cash flows and core operating results and aligns more comparably to AMETEK’s acquisitive peer companies. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results and guidance will be included in financial tables accompanying our press releases.  

“Our businesses delivered outstanding performance in 2018, positioning us well for continued success in 2019. The AMETEK Growth Model, which combines our four growth strategies of operational excellence, new product development, global and market expansion, and strategic acquisitions, along with a disciplined focus on cash generation and capital deployment continues to provide a scalable platform to drive long-term, sustainable growth,” noted Mr. Zapico.  

“In 2019, we expect overall sales to be up high single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2018, driven by contributions from recent acquisitions, and 3% to 5% organic sales growth. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $3.52 to $3.62. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.05, an increase of 8% to 11% over the prior year’s comparable basis,” he added.

“For the first quarter of 2019, sales are expected to be up high single digits on a percentage basis compared to the prior-year. On a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.86. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are anticipated to be in the range of $0.95 to $0.97, up 9% to 11% over the prior year comparable basis,” concluded Mr. Zapico.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information  

The Company supplements its consolidated financial statements presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis with certain non-GAAP financial information to provide investors with greater insight, increased transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying financial tables. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  

The Company believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing AMETEK’s operations that, when reconciled to the comparable GAAP measure, helps our investors to better understand the long-term profitability trends of our business, and facilitates easier comparisons of our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers. The items described above have been excluded from this measure because items of this nature and/or size occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to AMETEK’s commercial performance during the period and/or we believe are not indicative of AMETEK’s ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
