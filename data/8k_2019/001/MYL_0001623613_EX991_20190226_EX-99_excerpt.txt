HERTFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND AND PITTSBURGH - February 26, 2019 - Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ: MYL) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2018 and provided 2019 guidance.

Mylan is not providing forward looking guidance for U.S. GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, litigation settlements and other contingencies, including changes to contingent 

consideration and certain other gains or losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period. 

Mylan CEO Heather Bresch commented: “Our 2018 results were strong, especially in light of the fact that we had lower than expected uptake on generic Copaxone and did not receive our generic Advair approval, demonstrating once again the resiliency of our business model. We adapted quickly and strategically to market conditions, while at the same time remained a leader for the generics industry and an advocate for changes to the current structural issues in the U.S. healthcare system that hinder access to generics.

“Looking forward, I can confidently say, through leveraging the diversification across our commercial, operational and scientific platforms, we feel incredibly positive about our ability to deliver a strong top-line financial performance in 2019. Specifically, we expect to generate total revenues of between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion, reflecting top-line growth across all three of our geographic segments.

“Our business model is predicated on prioritizing long-term sustainable growth. Therefore, we will be making incremental investments in our sales and marketing and research and development efforts. As a result, we expect to deliver 2019 adjusted EPS in the range of $3.80 to $4.80. Additionally, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flows between $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion. At the same time, we are putting a highly disciplined financial lens to unlock latent value from the assets we’ve integrated as we transition to a business model that is predominantly driven by organic growth.”

Mylan President Rajiv Malik added: “We’re pleased with our results from 2018 and continue to be extremely proud of our scientific achievements over the past year. In 2019, you can expect us to move our portfolio and pipeline up the value chain, invest organically in our key brands and execute on our impressive commercial assets around the world. We anticipate growth of more than $1 billion in new launches, nearly all of which have already been approved, and which reflects a heavier weighting on specialty and complex generic products aligned with the evolution of the pharmaceutical industry.”

Mylan CFO Ken Parks added: "Mylan continued to generate strong cash flow with more than $2.7 billion of adjusted free cash flow for 2018, an increase of $86 million compared to the prior year and above the high-end of our initial guidance range for 2018. 2018 adjusted free cash flow conversion was healthy at approximately 115 percent of adjusted net earnings of $2.4 billion, another measure of the strength and durability of the cash flow generating capabilities of our business. In 2019, we remain committed to deleveraging and intend to repay at least $1.1 billion of debt during the year. We also remain fully committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating."

Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Results

Total revenues were $3.08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $3.24 billion in the prior year period, representing a decrease of $160.2 million, or 5%. Total revenues include both net sales and other revenues from third parties. Net sales for the current quarter were $3.04 billion compared to $3.19 billion for the prior year period, a decrease of $154.3 million, or 5%. Other revenues for the current quarter ended December 31, 2018 were $43.2 million, compared to $49.1 million for the comparable prior year period, a decrease of $5.9 million. 

The decrease in net sales included a decrease in the North America segment of 16% which was partially offset by increases in the Europe segment of 1% and in the Rest of World segment of 4%. The overall decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a decrease in net sales from existing products. Net sales from existing products, partially offset by new product launches, decreased on a constant currency basis by approximately $17.2 million primarily as a result of lower volumes and pricing. Net sales were also negatively impacted by approximately $40.0 million due to the adoption of new accounting standards. Mylan’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. Dollar as compared to the currencies of Mylan’s subsidiaries in the European Union (EU), India, and Australia. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on current quarter net sales was approximately $97.2 million, resulting in a decrease in constant currency net sales of approximately $57.1 million, or 2%. Below is a summary of net sales in each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2018:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

U.S. GAAP gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was $1.02 billion and U.S. GAAP gross margins were 33%. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, U.S. GAAP gross profit was $1.29 billion and U.S. GAAP gross margins were 40%. U.S. GAAP gross margins were negatively impacted by approximately 270 basis points related to the incremental amortization from product acquisitions and intangible asset impairment charges and by approximately 240 basis points as a result of incremental manufacturing expenses, site remediation expenses and incremental restructuring charges incurred during the current quarter principally as a result of the activities at the Company’s Morgantown plant. U.S. GAAP gross margins were also negatively impacted as a result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products partially offset by gross margins on new product introductions primarily in North America. Adjusted gross profit was $1.68 billion and adjusted gross margins were 55% for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to adjusted gross profit of $1.80 billion and adjusted gross margins of 55% in the prior year period. Adjusted gross margins were negatively impacted by lower gross profit from sales of existing products partially offset by gross margins on new product introductions primarily in North America.

R&D expense for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was $148.8 million, compared to $202.4 million for the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to lower expenditures related to the Company’s respiratory programs, lower expenses due to the reprioritization of global programs and higher payments in the prior year period related to licensing arrangements for products in development.

SG&A expense for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was $632.9 million, compared to $659.0 million for the prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to lower restructuring charges and the benefits of integration activities.

During the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net charge of $1.1 million for litigation settlements and other contingencies, net, compared to a net charge of $12.7 million in the comparable prior year period. The decrease from the comparable prior year period was primarily a result of the prior year's fair value adjustment to the contingent consideration related to the 2016 acquisition of the non-sterile, topicals-focused business of Renaissance Acquisition Holdings, LLC.

U.S. GAAP net earnings decreased by $193.1 million to $51.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, compared to U.S. GAAP net earnings of $244.3 million for the prior year period and U.S. GAAP EPS decreased to $0.10 from $0.46 in the prior year period. The Company recognized a U.S. GAAP income tax provision of $25.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, compared to a U.S. GAAP income tax provision of $82.8 million for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted net earnings decreased by $95.6 million to $669.7 million as compared to $765.3 million for the prior year period and adjusted EPS decreased to $1.30 from $1.43 in the prior year period.

EBITDA was $841.2 million for the current quarter and $962.2 million for the comparable prior year period. After adjusting for certain items as further detailed in the reconciliation below, adjusted EBITDA was $1.01 billion for the current quarter and $1.12 billion for the comparable prior year period.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Financial Results

For the year ended December 31, 2018, Mylan reported total revenues of $11.43 billion, compared to $11.91 billion for the prior year period, representing a decrease of $473.8 million, or 4%. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $11.27 billion, compared to $11.76 billion for the prior year period, representing a decrease of $491.3 million, or 4%. Other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $165.2 million, compared to $147.7 million for the prior year period, an increase of $17.5 million. The increase in other revenues was primarily the result of consideration received from the licensing of intellectual property during the current year.

The decrease in net sales included a decrease in the North America segment of 18%. This decrease was partially offset by increases in the Europe segment of 5% and in the Rest of World segment of 7%. The overall decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a decrease in net sales from existing products. Net sales from existing products, partially offset by new product sales, decreased on a constant currency basis by approximately $443.6 million primarily as a result of lower volumes, and to a lesser extent, pricing. Net sales were also negatively impacted by approximately $104.5 million due to the adoption of new accounting standards. Mylan’s net sales were favorably impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. Dollar as compared to the currencies of Mylan’s subsidiaries in the EU, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact from changes in the Indian Rupee and the Australian Dollar. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on current year net sales was approximately $56.7 million resulting in a decrease in constant currency net sales of approximately $548.0 million, or 5%. Below is a summary of net sales in each of our segments for the year ended December 31, 2018.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

U.S. GAAP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $4.00 billion and U.S. GAAP gross margins were 35%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, U.S. GAAP gross profit was $4.78 billion and U.S. GAAP gross margins were 40%. U.S. GAAP gross margins were negatively impacted by approximately 270 basis points related to the incremental amortization from product acquisitions and intangible asset impairment charges. U.S. GAAP gross margins were also negatively affected by approximately 220 basis points as a result of incremental manufacturing expenses, site remediation expenses and incremental restructuring charges incurred during the year principally as a result of the activities at the Company’s Morgantown plant. In addition, U.S. GAAP gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products partially offset by gross margins on new product introductions primarily in North America. Adjusted gross profit was $6.18 billion and 

5

adjusted gross margins were approximately 54% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to adjusted gross profit of $6.42 billion and adjusted gross margins of approximately 54% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted gross margins were negatively impacted by lower gross profit from sales of existing products partially offset by gross margins on new product introductions primarily in North America.

R&D expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $704.5 million, compared to $783.3 million for the prior year, a decrease of $78.8 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower expenditures related to the Company’s respiratory programs and lower expenses due to the reprioritization of global programs.

SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.44 billion, compared to $2.58 billion for the prior year, a decrease of $134.7 million. The decrease is primarily due to the benefits of integration activities, lower restructuring charges, lower acquisition-related costs of approximately $48.0 million, and reduced share-based compensation expense primarily due to the reversal of all of the cumulative expense totaling $70.6 million related to the Company’s One-Time Special Performance-Based Five-Year Realizable Value Incentive Program during the year ended December 31, 2018. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense of approximately $26.5 million related to a special business interruption event for one customer, and $20.0 million of compensation expense as an additional discretionary bonus for a certain group of employees. None of the employees eligible for this bonus are named executive officers.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net gain of $49.5 million for litigation settlements and other contingencies, net, compared to a net gain of $13.1 million in the prior year. The increase is due to lower charges for litigation settlements partially offset by lower gains on contingent consideration adjustments in 2018 compared to the prior year.

U.S. GAAP net earnings decreased by $343.5 million to $352.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $696.0 million for the prior year.

Q4 2018 Earnings Call and 2019 Guidance

As previously announced, Mylan N.V. will host a webcast at 5:00 p.m. ET today to discuss the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018, along with financial guidance for 2019. The webcast can be accessed live by calling 855.493.3607 or 346.354.0950 for international callers (ID#: 9783018) or at the following address on the Company's website: investor.mylan.com. The “Q4 2018 Earnings Call & 2019 Guidance” presentation, which will be referenced during the call can be found at investor.mylan.com. A replay of the webcast also will be available on the website. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release includes the presentation and discussion of certain financial information that differs from what is reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted EPS, constant currency net sales, constant currency total revenues, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margins, adjusted net earnings, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted R&D, adjusted SG&A, adjusted R&D as a % of total revenues, adjusted SG&A as a % of total revenues, adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted interest expense, adjusted other expense (income), net, adjusted effective tax rate, notional debt to Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA, long-term average debt to Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow are presented in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the financial performance of Mylan N.V. ("Mylan" or the "Company"). Management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, measuring its operating performance, and incentive-based awards. Primarily due to 

7

acquisitions and other significant events which may impact comparability of our periodic operating results, Mylan believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results was limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. The financial performance of the Company is measured by senior management, in part, using adjusted metrics included herein, along with other performance metrics. Management’s annual incentive compensation is derived, in part, based on the adjusted EPS metric and the adjusted free cash flow metric. In addition, the Company believes that including EBITDA and supplemental adjustments applied in presenting adjusted EBITDA and Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) pursuant to our Credit Agreements is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the Company's ability to comply with financial debt covenants and assess the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness. We also report sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measures of "constant currency" total revenues and net sales. These measures provide information on the change in total revenues and net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period. The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. We routinely evaluate our net sales and total revenues performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating a period-to-period comparison of our operational activities, and believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason. The "Summary of Total Revenues by Segment" table below compares net sales on an actual and constant currency basis for each reportable segment for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 as well as for total revenues. Also, set forth below, Mylan has provided reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures set forth below, and investors and other readers should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

For additional information regarding the components and uses of Non-GAAP financial measures refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of Mylan’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Mylan is not providing forward looking guidance for U.S. GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, litigation settlements and other contingencies, including changes to contingent consideration and certain other gains or losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period.
