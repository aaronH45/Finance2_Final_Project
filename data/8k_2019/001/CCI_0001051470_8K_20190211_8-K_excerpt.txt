 ITEM 1.01.  

ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.  

On February 11, 2019, Crown Castle International Corp. (“Company”) closed its previously announced public offering (“Debt Offering”) of $600 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 4.300% Senior Notes due 2029 (“2029 Notes”) and $400 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 5.200% Senior Notes due 2049 (“2049 Notes,” together with the 2029 Notes, “Notes”). The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of February 11, 2019 (“Base Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (“Trustee”), as amended and supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated as of February 11, 2019 (“First Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, “Indenture”), between the Company and the Trustee. The Company used the net proceeds from the Debt Offering to repay outstanding borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility.  

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, which rank equally with all existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Company’s obligations under its senior unsecured credit facility, and senior to all future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes will effectively rank junior to all of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries. The 2029 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.300% per annum and the 2049 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.200% per annum, with interest on the Notes payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, to persons who are registered holders of the Notes on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1, beginning on August 15, 2019.  

The Indenture limits the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur certain liens and merge with or into other companies, in each case subject to certain exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Indenture.  

In the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the Notes of a series will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Notes of such series at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of such repurchase.  

The 2029 Notes will mature on February 15, 2029. The 2049 Notes will mature on February 15, 2049. However, the Company, at its option, may redeem some or all of the Notes of a series at any time or from time to time prior to their maturity. If the Company elects to redeem the 2029 Notes prior to November 15, 2028 (the date that is three months prior to their maturity date) or the 2049 Notes prior to August 15, 2048 (the date that is six months prior to their maturity date), the Company will pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If the Company elects to redeem the 2029 Notes on or after November 15, 2028 (the date that is three months prior to their maturity date) or the 2049 Notes on or after August 15, 2048 (the date that is six months prior to their maturity date), the Company will pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the date of redemption.  

The above description of the Indenture does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Indenture and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Indenture. The Company is filing the Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which exhibits are incorporated herein by reference.
