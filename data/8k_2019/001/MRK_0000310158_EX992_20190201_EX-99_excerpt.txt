Sum of quarterly amounts may not equal year-to-date amounts due to rounding. 

On January 1, 2018, the company adopted a new accounting standard related to defined benefit plans that requires the components of net benefit cost/credit (other than service costs) be presented in the statement of income outside of operating expenses. Upon adoption, net periodic benefit cost/credit other than service cost was reclassified to Other (income) expense, net from the previous classifications within Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses and Research and development costs. Previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. There was no impact to net income as a result of adopting the new standard. 

(1) No potential dilutive common shares were used in the computations of loss per common share assuming dilution as the effects would have been anti-dilutive.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Only the line items that are affected by non-GAAP adjustments are shown. 

Merck is providing certain non-GAAP information that excludes certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. Management believes that providing this information enhances investors’ understanding of the company’s results as it permits investors to understand how management assesses performance. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the company along with other metrics. Senior management’s annual compensation is derived in part using non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS. This information should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

(1) Amounts included in cost of sales primarily reflect expenses for the amortization of intangible assets recognized as a result of business acquisitions. Amounts included in selling, general and administrative expenses reflect integration, transaction and certain other costs related to business acquisitions and divestitures. Amounts included in research and development expenses reflect $230 million of in-process research and development (IPR&D) impairment charges, partially offset by a reduction of expenses related to a decrease in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Amounts included in other (income) expense, net reflect goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges related to a business in the Healthcare Services segment, largely offset by royalty income related to the termination of the Sanofi-Pasteur MSD joint venture. 

(2) Amounts primarily include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested related to activities under the company’s formal restructuring programs. 

(3) Represents the estimated tax impact on the reconciling items based on applying the statutory rate of the originating territory of the non-GAAP adjustments.
