ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS  

Pursuant Section 7.3 of the Debtors’ Fourth Amended and Restated Joint Chapter 11 Plan of AMR Corp et al (the “Plan”), a Disputed Claims Reserve was established to provide for payments and distributions with respect to disputed claims in accordance with the Plan. The sole assets initially placed into the Disputed Claims Reserve consisted of shares of common stock of American Airlines Group Inc. (the “Company”), par value $0.01 per share (“AAL Shares”). The AAL Shares issued to the Disputed Claims Reserve were originally issued on December 13, 2013 and have at all times since then been included in the number of shares issued and outstanding as reported by the Company from time to time in its quarterly and annual reports, including for purposes of calculating earnings per share.  

On February 12, 2019, in accordance with approval granted by the Bankruptcy Court, there was distributed from the Disputed Claims Reserve an aggregate of approximately 17.3 million AAL Shares. These shares were distributed as follows:  

   •    

Former holders of common stock of AMR Corporation (formerly traded under the symbol: “AAMRQ”) were distributed approximately 0.0432 AAL Shares for each share of AAMRQ previously held;  

   •    

Former holders of AMR Corporation’s 6.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (“2014 Notes”) that elected under the Plan to be treated as if they held shares of AAMRQ were distributed approximately 4.7426 AAL Shares for each $1,000 of principal amount of such notes; and  

   •    

Former holders of AMR Corporation’s 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (“2024 Notes”) that elected under the Plan to be treated as if they held shares of AAMRQ were distributed Approximately 2.0774 AAL Shares for each $1,000 of principal amount of such notes.  

The distributions of AAL Shares to former holders of AAMRQ, 2014 Notes and 2024 Notes described above are expected to be completed on or about February 14, 2019. Former holders of AAMRQ, 2014 Notes and 2024 Notes may receive additional distributions based upon the resolution of disputed claims in the bankruptcy case; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the outcome and timing of the disputed claims, there is no guarantee of additional distributions. After giving effect to the foregoing distributions, the Disputed Claims Reserve holds approximately 7.2 million AAL Shares.  

The Company has posted to the Investor Relations section of its website at https://americanairlines.gcs-web.com/faqs further information relating the mechanics of the distribution process and related contact information to assist investors with questions regarding the process. The content of the Company’s website is not incorporated by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K.
