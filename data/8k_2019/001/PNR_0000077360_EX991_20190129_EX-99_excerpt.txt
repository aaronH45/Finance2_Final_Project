"2018 was an eventful year for Pentair as we began our new journey as a pure play water company," said John L. Stauch, Pentair President and Chief Executive Officer. "We delivered on our 2018 commitments while successfully completing the separation of nVent Electric plc to shareholders. During 2018, we returned nearly $700 million to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Our core sales growth accelerated during the year and we were able to expand our margins while making a number of long-term, strategic growth investments. To start 2019, we announced agreements for two strategic acquisitions to further our Residential & Commercial water treatment strategy. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape and we remain committed to executing our strategy as a focused Residential & Commercial water treatment company."
