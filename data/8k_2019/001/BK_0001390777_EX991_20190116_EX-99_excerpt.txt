CEO Commentary

“While our reported earnings per share declined 22 percent, our results in this quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017 included a series of notable items that make comparisons difficult. Excluding these items, earnings per share grew by 9 percent,” Charlie Scharf, chairman and chief executive officer, said.

“The underlying performance of our businesses was mixed as our revenue declined, but we continued to maintain strong expense discipline. In addition, we benefited from a lower tax rate and our ongoing ability to return capital to shareholders through buybacks,” Mr. Scharf added.

“Revenue growth in several of our Investment Services businesses was more than offset by lower revenue in our Investment Management business. Our expenses were essentially flat despite a sustained significant increase in technology and infrastructure investments as we remain focused on driving efficiency and maintaining our cost discipline,” Mr. Scharf continued. 

“We are continuing to return a significant amount of the capital we generate to shareholders. During 2018, we returned $4.3 billion, which includes the incremental $830 million that we announced in December. This represents a payout of just over 100 percent of earnings in 2018,” Mr. Scharf also noted.

“As we look forward, we are cautious regarding how the economic and market environment will impact our business in 2019. We will remain keenly focused on managing our expense base. Our ongoing drive toward efficiency will allow us to continue to increase our investment in technology and infrastructure without meaningfully impacting the total cost base,” Mr. Scharf concluded.

INVESTMENT SERVICES BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

KEY DRIVERS

•Total revenue increased year-over-year and decreased sequentially. Net interest revenue increased year-over-year in most businesses, primarily driven by higher interest rates. The drivers of fee revenue by line of business are indicated below.

•Asset Servicing - The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower client assets and activity and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher net interest revenue. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower client assets and activity including securities lending, partially offset by higher net interest revenue driven by higher deposit balances.

•Pershing - The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the previously disclosed lost business, partially offset by higher clearance volumes and net interest revenue.

•Issuer Services - The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher Depositary Receipts revenue driven by corporate actions and higher volumes and a smaller volume increase in Corporate Trust. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonality in Depositary Receipts. 

•Treasury Services - Both increases primarily reflect higher payment volumes and net interest revenue. 

•Clearance and Collateral Management - Both increases primarily reflect growth in clearance and collateral management and higher net interest revenue.

•Noninterest expense increased year-over-year primarily driven by investments in technology, partially offset by the impact of notable items. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher severance expense and investments in technology.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Net of distribution and servicing expense. See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 12 for the reconciliation of this Non-GAAP measure. In 1Q18, the adjusted pre-tax operating margin – Non-GAAP for prior periods was restated to include amortization of intangible assets and the provision for credit losses.

(b)Includes AUM and AUC/A in the Wealth Management business.

(c)Excludes securities lending cash management assets and assets managed in the Investment Services business.

KEY DRIVERS

•Total revenue decreased year-over-year and sequentially.

•Asset Management - The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the impact of net outflows, lower equity markets and the divestiture of CenterSquare. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower equity markets, partially offset by seasonally higher performance fees. Both decreases also reflect the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British Pound).

•Wealth Management - Both decreases primarily reflect lower equity markets and net interest revenue.

•Noninterest expense decreased year-over-year primarily reflecting lower incentive expense and the divestiture of CenterSquare. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher severance.

OTHER SEGMENT primarily includes leasing operations, certain corporate treasury activities, derivatives, business exits and other corporate revenue and expense items.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

KEY DRIVERS

•Fee revenue increased year-over-year and sequentially primarily reflecting the impact of U.S. tax legislation on our renewable energy investments. 

•Net interest expense decreased year-over-year primarily resulting from the leasing-related adjustments recorded in 4Q17. 

•Noninterest expense increased year-over-year and sequentially primarily reflecting the expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters and higher severance.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY

Our consolidated capital and liquidity ratios are shown in the following table. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Regulatory capital ratios for Dec. 31, 2018 are preliminary. For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under the U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, which for the periods noted above was the Advanced Approaches. 

(b)Regulatory capital ratios for Dec. 31, 2017 are presented on a fully phased-in basis. On a transitional basis at Dec. 31, 2017, the CET1 ratio was 10.7%, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.7%, the Total capital ratio was 13.4%, the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.6% and the SLR was 6.1%.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

KEY POINTS

CET1 capital totaled $17.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2018, a decrease of $950 million compared with Sept. 30, 2018. The decrease primarily reflects capital deployed through common stock repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by capital generated through earnings.

NET INTEREST REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Net interest revenue (FTE) – Non-GAAP and net interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP include the tax equivalent adjustments on tax-exempt income which allows for comparisons of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

(b)Includes the impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements.

(c)Yields/rates include the impact of interest rate hedging activities.

bps – basis points.

KEY DRIVERS

•Net interest revenue increased year-over-year primarily driven by higher interest rates and a lease-related adjustment recorded in 4Q17, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing deposits. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the higher interest rate impact on deposit pricing and the impact of interest rate hedging activities, partially offset by higher deposits. The impact of interest rate hedging activities is primarily offset in foreign exchange and other trading revenue.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

KEY DRIVERS

•Total noninterest expense decreased 1% year-over-year, or decreased slightly excluding notable items. The impact of the notable items in both periods was substantially the same. Investments in technology were more than offset by lower staff expense, the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower bank assessment charges, primarily due to lower FDIC assessments. The investments in technology are included in staff, professional, legal and other purchased services and software and equipment expenses. 

•The sequential increase in total noninterest expense primarily reflects higher severance expense, expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters and investments in technology, partially offset by lower bank assessment charges, primarily due to lower FDIC assessments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)In 1Q18, we adopted new accounting guidance included in Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which required the reclassification of the components of pension and other postretirement costs, other than the service cost component. As a result, staff expense increased and other expense decreased. Prior periods have been reclassified. 

(b)Beginning in 1Q18, clearing expense, which was previously included in other expense, was included with sub-custodian expense. Prior periods have been reclassified. 

(c)Beginning in 1Q18, M&I, litigation and restructuring charges are no longer separately disclosed. Expenses previously reported in this line have been reclassified to existing expense categories, primarily other expense.

BNY Mellon 4Q18 Earnings Release

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION – EXPLANATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Release certain Non-GAAP financial measures on a tangible basis, as a supplement to GAAP information. Tangible common shareholders’ equity excludes goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure is an additional useful measure for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income. BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per common share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. 

BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures excluding notable items, including the impact of U.S. tax legislation on our investments in renewable energy and investment securities losses related to the sale of certain securities. Expense measures, excluding notable items, including severance, expenses associated with the consolidating real estate, litigation expense and an asset impairment, are also presented. Litigation expense represents accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees. Income before tax measures, excluding the notable items mentioned above, as well the estimated net benefit related to U.S. tax legislation and the adjustments to those provisional estimates and other changes, are provided. In addition, operating leverage, operating margins and diluted earnings per share, excluding the notable items impacting revenue, expense and income tax items mentioned above are adjusted to permit investors to view the financial measures on a basis consistent with how management views the businesses.

BNY Mellon has presented the operating margin for the Investment Management business net of distribution and servicing expense that was passed to third parties who distribute or service our managed funds. BNY Mellon believes that this measure is useful when evaluating the performance of the Investment Management business relative to industry competitors. 

The following table presents the reconciliation of the return on common equity and tangible common equity.
