  Financial Overview3  

NEW YORK, January 17, 2019 – Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today reported net revenues of $8.5 billion1 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018 compared with $9.5 billion a year ago. For the current quarter, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $1.5 billion, or $0.80 per diluted share,4 compared with net income of $643 million, or $0.26 per diluted share,4,5 for the same period a year ago. In the current quarter, the Firm recorded an intermittent net discrete tax benefit of $111 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily associated with new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations. The prior year fourth quarter included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $1.0 billion, or a loss of $0.58 per diluted share, primarily related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.5 

Compensation expense of $3.8 billion decreased from $4.3 billion a year ago on lower net revenues, partially offset by a reduction in the portion of discretionary incentive compensation subject to deferral (“compensation deferral modification”). Non-compensation expenses of $2.9 billion increased from $2.8 billion a year ago.1 

The annualized return on average common equity was 7.7% and the annualized return on average tangible common equity was 8.8% in the current quarter.2

-   

Fixed Income sales and trading net revenues of $564 million decreased from $808 million a year ago reflecting lower results in credit and rates products due to unfavorable market making conditions that resulted from significant credit spread widening and volatile rate movements, partially offset by increases in commodities revenues.

•   

Investment revenues were negative $52 million compared with positive revenues of $213 million a year ago.

1 Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which among other things, requires a gross presentation of certain costs that were previously netted against net revenues. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, this change in presentation resulted in an increase to net revenues and non-compensation expenses of $70 million, of which $62 million was reported in the Institutional Securities segment and $17 million in the Investment Management segment. In addition, the Firm included an intersegment elimination of $(9) million related to intercompany activity. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there was an increase to net revenues and non-compensation expenses of $350 million, of which $320 million was reported in the Institutional Securities segment and $78 million in the Investment Management segment. The Firm included an intersegment elimination of $(48) million related to intercompany activity. This change in presentation did not have an impact on net income. Prior periods have not been restated pursuant to this guidance. 

2 Return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, annualized return on average common equity, annualized return on average tangible common equity and tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers useful for investors and analysts to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance and capital adequacy. The calculation of return on average common equity and return on average tangible common equity represents full year net income or annualized net income for the quarter applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction. 

3 The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain “non-GAAP financial measures” in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a “non-GAAP financial measure” as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to investors and analysts in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing our financial condition, operating results, or prospective regulatory capital requirements. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for U.S. GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. 

4 Includes preferred dividends related to the calculation of earnings per share of $170 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017. Includes preferred dividends related to the calculation of earnings per share of $526 million and $523 million for the years ended 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

5 The fourth quarter and full year of 2017 included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $1.2 billion as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Act, primarily from the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower enacted corporate tax rate, partially offset by the intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $168 million and $233 million for the fourth quarter and full year ended 2017, respectively. 

6 Pre-tax income represents income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes. 

7 

7 Pre-tax margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for investors and analysts to assess operating performance. Pre-tax margin represents income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes divided by net revenues. 

8 AUM is defined as assets under management. 

9 VaR represents the loss amount that one would not expect to exceed, on average, more than five times every one hundred trading days in the Firm’s trading positions if the portfolio were held constant for a one-day period. Further discussion of the calculation of VaR and the limitations of the Firm’s VaR methodology is disclosed in Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (“2017 Form 10-K”). Refer to page 7 of Morgan Stanley’s Financial Supplement accompanying this release for the VaR disclosure. 

  10 Transactional revenues include investment banking, trading, and commissions and fee revenues. 

 11 Wealth Management client liabilities reflect U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ lending and broker-dealer margin activity. U.S. Bank refers to the Firm's U.S. Bank operating subsidiaries Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association. 

12 The average annualized revenue per Wealth Management representative metric represents annualized net revenues divided by average representative headcount. 

13 In accordance with the accounting update, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective prospectively beginning in 2018, the timing of recognition of certain performance fees, not in the form of carried interest, is generally expected to be deferred within a fiscal year until the fees are no longer probable of being reversed. Accordingly, a greater portion of such performance fees revenues were recognized in the first and fourth quarter of calendar year 2018 based on current fee arrangements.

 14 The Firm Expense Efficiency Ratio represents total non-interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues. 

15 Source: Thomson Reuters – for the period of January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 as of January 4, 2019. 

16 The Firm’s risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios computed under the (i) standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”) (the “Standardized Approach”); and (ii) applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the “Advanced Approach”). At December 31, 2018, the Firm’s ratios are based on the Standardized Approach fully phased-in rules. Regulatory compliance was determined based on capital ratios calculated under transitional rules until December 31, 2017. For information on the calculation of regulatory capital and ratios for prior periods, please refer to Part II, Item 7 “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Regulatory Requirements” in the Firm’s 2017 Form 10-K. 

17 The Supplementary Leverage Ratio became effective as a capital standard on January 1, 2018. As such, the Firm must maintain a Tier 1 supplementary leverage capital buffer of at least 2% in addition to the 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio (for a total of at least 5%), in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The Firm’s Supplementary Leverage Ratio utilizes a fully phased-in Tier 1 capital numerator of approximately $70.6 billion and a fully phased-in supplementary leverage exposure denominator of approximately $1.09 trillion. 

18 Book value per common share represents common equity divided by period end common shares outstanding. 

8 

19 Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers to be a useful measure of capital adequacy for investors and analysts. Tangible book value per common share represents tangible common equity divided by period end common shares outstanding.
