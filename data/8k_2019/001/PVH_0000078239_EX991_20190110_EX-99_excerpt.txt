PVH CORP. UPDATES 2018 FOURTH QUARTER 

AND FULL YEAR OUTLOOK AND QUANTIFIES

 CALVIN KLEIN RESTRUCTURING 

New York, New York - PVH Corp. [NYSE: PVH] announced today that it currently expects revenue in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 to be at least $2.40 billion and $9.57 billion, respectively, which is above its plan.

The Company also revised its projected fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings per share outlook. The Company is unable to project fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings per share on a GAAP basis without unreasonable efforts, as further discussed below. The Company currently expects its earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter 2018 to be at least $1.75, which is $0.15 per share above the high end of its guidance range previously announced on November 29, 2018 and includes a $0.05 per share benefit due to lower than expected income tax expense. The Company currently expects its full year 2018 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis to be at least $9.50. The projected fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis excludes, among other things, the pre-tax costs expected to be incurred in connection with a restructuring in the Company's Calvin Klein business, discussed below, and the resulting tax effects.

Emanuel Chirico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our improved 2018 outlook reflects the power of our diversified global business model. Specifically, we are experiencing outperformance across all of our businesses relative to our previous guidance, despite the increasingly volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.”

Calvin Klein Restructuring:

The Company's Calvin Klein business issued a press release earlier today detailing the strategic changes for the CALVIN KLEIN brand. The Company expects to incur pre-tax costs of approximately $120 million over the next 12 months in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring, primarily consisting of severance, inventory markdowns and allowances, asset impairments, and lease and other contract termination expenses, including as a result of the closure of its flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York, New York. Cash outflows related to these pre-tax costs are expected to be approximately $60 million over the next 12 months. 

Earnings Guidance: 

The Company’s projection of fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis excludes (i) the pre-tax costs incurred and to be incurred related to the April 2016 acquisition of the 55% interest in the Company’s former Tommy Hilfiger joint venture in China that it did not already own (the “TH China acquisition”), consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets, (ii) the pre-tax costs to be incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring and (iii) the pre-tax actuarial gain or loss on the Company’s retirement plans. The estimated tax effects of the above pre-tax items are also excluded from the Company’s projections of fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis.

The Company is unable to provide a full reconciliation of its updated fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings per share guidance on a non-GAAP basis to the corresponding measures on a GAAP basis without unreasonable efforts, as there are significant uncertainties with respect to (i) the timing of the costs to be incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring over the next 12 months and, more critically, during the Company's fourth quarter and full year 2018, which end on February 3, 2019, and (ii) the actuarial gain or loss on the Company’s retirement plans, to be recorded in the fourth quarter 2018, due to the recent volatility in the financial markets.

The reconciling information for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings per share guidance on a non-GAAP basis to the corresponding measures on a GAAP basis that is available without unreasonable efforts is presented at the end of this release, consisting of the costs incurred and to be incurred related to the TH China acquisition and the resulting estimated tax effect.

PVH CORP.

Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts

The Company is presenting its 2018 estimated results excluding (i) the pre-tax costs incurred and to be incurred related to the April 2016 acquisition of the 55% interest in the Company’s former Tommy Hilfiger joint venture in China that it did not already own (the “TH China acquisition”), consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets, (ii) the pre-tax costs to be incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring, primarily consisting of severance, inventory markdowns and allowances, asset impairments, and lease and other contract termination expenses, including as a result of the closure of its flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York, New York, (iii) the pre-tax actuarial gain or loss on the Company’s retirement plans and (iv) the estimated tax effects associated with the foregoing pre-tax items. 

A full reconciliation of the Company’s current 2018 estimated results on a non-GAAP basis to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the significant uncertainties with respect to (i) the timing of the costs to be incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring and (ii) the actuarial gain or loss on the Company’s retirement plans to be recorded in the fourth quarter. However, the reconciling information that is available without unreasonable efforts, consisting of the pre-tax costs incurred and to be incurred related to the TH China acquisition and the resulting estimated tax effect, is set forth in the reconciliation below. The previous 2018 net income per common share guidance as provided in the Company’s 2018 third quarter earnings press release issued on November 29, 2018 and set forth below, presented on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, is no longer valid and presented only for informational purposes. 

The Company believes presenting its results on a non-GAAP basis provides useful additional information to investors. The Company excludes amounts from its non-GAAP results that it deems to be non-recurring or non-operational and believes that excluding them (i) facilitates comparing current results against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company, and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company uses its results on a non-GAAP basis to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results on a non-GAAP basis are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

The estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items are based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluates each item that it has identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item is taxable or tax deductible, and if so, in what jurisdiction the tax expense or tax deduction would occur. The estimated tax effect associated with the pre-tax costs incurred and to be incurred related to the TH China acquisition is identified as tax deductible, with the tax effect taken at the statutory income tax rate of the local jurisdiction.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) The Company is unable to provide without unreasonable efforts the projected net income per common share impact of the costs to be incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring announced today due to the significant uncertainties with respect to the timing of such costs, including which portion, if any, will be incurred during the current quarter, which ends on February 3, 2019. 

(b) The Company is unable to provide without unreasonable efforts the projected net income per common share impact of the gain or loss on the Company’s retirement plans, to be recorded in the current quarter, due to the recent volatility in the financial markets. 

The previous GAAP net income per common share attributable to PVH Corp. amounts presented in the above table, as well as the amounts excluded in providing non-GAAP earnings guidance, would be expected to change as a result of (i) acquisition, restructuring, divestment or similar transactions or activities, (ii) the timing and strategy of restructuring and integration initiatives or other one-time events, if any, that the Company engages in or suffers during the period, including the Calvin Klein restructuring, (iii) any market or other changes affecting the Company’s expected actuarial gain or loss on retirement plans, (iv) the imposition of significant tariffs

on apparel, footwear and accessories imported from China or any of the Company’s other significant sourcing countries, (v) adjustments to the Company’s income tax provision related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Legislation"), including as a result of changes in the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 during the permitted measurement period, as regulatory guidance may be issued related to the Tax Legislation and as the Company completes its final analysis of the impacts of the Tax Legislation, or (vi) any discrete tax events including changes in tax rates or tax law and events arising from audits or the resolution of uncertain tax positions. The Company has no current understanding or agreement regarding any such transaction or definitive plans regarding any such activity that has not been announced or completed.
