SEATTLE, Wash. (February 28, 2019) – Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter ended February 2, 2019 of $1.48.

Nordstrom aspires to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world, focused on better serving customers through three strategic pillars: providing a compelling product offering, delivering outstanding services and experiences, and leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom brand. In 2018, the Company achieved the following milestones in executing its customer strategy:

•Approximately 10 million customers, or one-third of total customers, shopped across multiple channels, which leads to higher customer spend. This represents an increase of 6 percent. 

•Nordstrom’s combined physical and digital presence represents a competitive advantage in offering customers a differentiated experience. Digital sales increased 16 percent and made up 30 percent of sales. 

•Nordstrom launched its local market strategy, which drove outsized market share gains in Los Angeles and increased product selection, delivery speed and convenience for customers.

•Generational investments continued to scale, contributing approximately $2 billion in sales and improvement in profitability. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook exceeded $1 billion in sales. Trunk Club delivered sales growth of 35 percent. The Company opened its Men’s Store in New York City and furthered its expansion into Canada with the introduction of six Nordstrom Rack stores.

•Nordstrom maintained a strong financial position, generating annual operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion for 10 consecutive years and returning $1 billion to shareholders in 2018.

•The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26 percent.

•Estimated annual average outstanding shares are expected to be approximately 162 million, which excludes the impact of any future share repurchases.

SUMMARY OF NET SALES

(unaudited; dollar amounts in millions)

During the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard (Revenue Standard) using the modified retrospective adoption method. Results beginning in the first quarter of 2018 are presented under the new Revenue Standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted. Also beginning in 2018, we aligned our sales presentation with how we view the results of our operations internally and how our customers view us, by our Full-Price and Off-Price businesses.

Our Full-Price business includes our Nordstrom U.S. full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Canada, Trunk Club, Jeffrey and Nordstrom Local. Our Off-Price business includes Nordstrom U.S. Rack stores, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook and Last Chance clearance stores. The following table summarizes net sales and comparable sales for the quarter and year ended February 2, 2019 compared with the same periods in fiscal 2017:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 We present our sales in the way that management views our results internally, including presenting 2018 under the new Revenue Standard while prior period amounts are not adjusted and allocating our sales return reserves and loyalty related adjustments to Full-Price and Off-Price. For 2017, Other primarily included unallocated sales return, in-transit and loyalty related adjustments necessary to reconcile sales by business to total net sales.

2 Full-Price net sales decreased 8.8% for the fourth quarter and 1.5% for the year ended February 2, 2019. This included a decrease of approximately 800 basis points for the fourth quarter and 300 basis points for the year ended February 2, 2019, due primarily to the 53rd week and loyalty related adjustments. 

3 Off-Price net sales decreased 2.7% for the fourth quarter and increased 4.5% for the year ended February 2, 2019. This included a decrease of approximately 800 basis points for the fourth quarter and 250 basis points for the year ended February 2, 2019, due primarily to the 53rd week and loyalty related adjustments. 

4 Total net sales decreased 4.7% for the fourth quarter and increased 2.3% for the year ended February 2, 2019. This included a decrease of approximately 500 basis points in the fourth quarter and 150 basis points for the year ended February 2, 2019, due to the 53rd week. The impact of adopting the new Revenue Standard was not material for the year ended February 2, 2019.

ADJUSTED RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (“ADJUSTED ROIC”) 

(NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES)

(unaudited; dollar amounts in millions)

We believe that Adjusted ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital we have invested in our business to generate returns. Adjusted ROIC adjusts our operating leases as if they met the criteria for capital leases or we had purchased the properties. This provides additional supplemental information that reflects the investment in our off-balance sheet operating leases, controls for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors and provides investors and credit agencies with another way to comparably evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our capital investments over time. In addition, we incorporate Adjusted ROIC into our executive incentive measures and it is an important indicator of shareholders’ return over the long term. 

We define Adjusted ROIC as our adjusted net operating profit after tax divided by our average invested capital using the trailing 12-month average. Adjusted ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, return on assets, net earnings, total assets or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. Estimated depreciation on capitalized operating leases and average estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases are not calculated in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution of our results as reported under GAAP. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted ROIC is return on assets. The following is a reconciliation of the components and adjustments to Adjusted ROIC and return on assets:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Capitalized operating leases is our best estimate of the asset base we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or we had purchased the property. The asset base is calculated based upon the trailing 12-month average of the monthly asset base. The asset base for each month is calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the asset base we would record for our capitalized operating leases. We do not expect the adoption of the new Lease standard to have a material impact on our Adjusted ROIC.

2 Results for the 12 fiscal months ended February 2, 2019 include lower income tax expense primarily associated with corporate tax reform and a $72 unfavorable impact related to the estimated non-recurring credit-related charge. Results for the 12 fiscal months ended February 3, 2018 include a $42 unfavorable impact related to tax reform.

ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)

(unaudited; dollar amounts in millions)

Adjusted Debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (“EBITDAR”) is one of our key financial metrics, and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment-grade credit rating and operate with an efficient capital structure. In evaluating our debt levels, this measure provides a reflection of our credit worthiness that could impact our credit rating and borrowing costs. We also have a debt covenant that requires an adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio of no more than four times.

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, debt to net earnings, net earnings, debt or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is debt to net earnings. The following is a reconciliation of the components of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR and debt to net earnings:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The components of Adjusted Debt are as of February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, while the components of Adjusted EBITDAR are for the 12 months ended February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018.

2 Based upon the estimated lease liability as of the end of the period, calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the debt we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or we had purchased the property. We do not expect the adoption of the new Lease standard to have a material impact on our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR.

3 Results for the 12 fiscal months ended February 2, 2019 include lower income tax expense primarily associated with corporate tax reform and a $72 unfavorable impact related to the estimated non-recurring credit-related charge. Results for the 12 fiscal months ended February 3, 2018 include a $42 unfavorable impact related to tax reform.

FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)

(unaudited; amounts in millions)

Free Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures, and when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, provides investors with a meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash from our business. 

Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we no longer adjust free cash flow for cash dividends paid. We believe this presentation is more reflective of our operating performance and more consistent with the way we manage our business, how our peers calculate free cash flows and prevailing industry practice. Prior period Free Cash Flow financial measures have been recast to conform with current period presentation.

Free Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:

ADJUSTED EBITDA (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)

(unaudited; amounts in millions)

Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is our key financial metric to reflect our view of cash flow from net earnings. Adjusted EBITDA excludes significant items which are non-operating in nature in order to evaluate our core operating performance against prior periods. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for net earnings, overall change in cash or liquidity of the business as a whole. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The following is a reconciliation of net earnings to Adjusted EBITDA:
