DALLAS (Jan. 23, 2019) – Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today reported fourth-quarter revenue of $3.72 billion, net income of $1.24 billion and earnings per share of $1.27. Earnings per share include a 1 cent discrete tax benefit not in the company’s original guidance. 

Regarding the company’s performance and returns to shareholders, Rich Templeton, TI’s chairman, president and CEO, made the following comments: 

•  

“Revenue decreased 1 percent from the same quarter a year ago as demand for our products continued to slow across most markets. 

•  

“In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 4 percent and Embedded Processing declined 12 percent from the same quarter a year ago. 

•  

“Our cash flow from operations of $7.2 billion for the year again underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow for the year was $6.1 billion and represents 38.4 percent of revenue. This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. 

•  

“We have returned $7.7 billion to owners in 2018 through stock repurchases and dividends. Our strategy is to return all our free cash flow to owners. Over the last 12 months, our dividends represented 42 percent of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.  

•  

“TI’s first-quarter outlook is for revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion, and earnings per share between $1.03 and $1.21, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. For 2019, TI’s annual operating tax rate is expected to be about 16 percent.” 

Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.

Non-GAAP financial information 

This release includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations).  

We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. 

Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below.  

Amounts are in millions of dollars. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

This release also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-GAAP term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term annual operating tax rate more clearly communicates that discrete tax items are excluded from such rate. The term also helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items. No adjustments are made to the estimated annual effective tax rate when using the term annual operating tax rate.
