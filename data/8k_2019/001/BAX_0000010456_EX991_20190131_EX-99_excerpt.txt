Fourth-Quarter Financial Results  

Worldwide sales in the fourth quarter totaled approximately $2.8 billion, an increase of 2 percent on a reported basis and 5 percent on both a constant currency basis and operational basis compared to the prior-year period. Operational sales in the fourth quarter adjust for the impact of foreign exchange and generic competition for U.S. cyclophosphamide, as well as the company’s acquisition of two surgical products from Mallinckrodt plc, which closed in March 2018.  

Sales in the U.S. totaled $1.2 billion, increasing 4 percent on a reported basis and 2 percent on an operational basis. International sales of $1.7 billion increased 1 percent on a reported basis and 6 percent on both a constant currency and operational basis. Drivers of growth in the quarter included Baxter’s Renal Care, Pharmaceuticals, Advanced Surgery and Acute Therapies businesses. Increased demand for Baxter’s contract manufacturing services also contributed to performance in the quarter.  

Please see the attached schedules accompanying this press release for additional details on sales performance in the quarter, including breakouts by Baxter’s three geographic segments and six global business units (GBUs).  

Baxter reported income from continuing operations of $354 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, on a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis for the fourth quarter. These results include special items totaling $67 million after-tax, primarily related to business optimization and intangible amortization. On an adjusted basis, Baxter’s fourth quarter income from continuing operations totaled $421 million, or $0.78 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings per diluted share advanced 22 percent in the quarter, driven by solid operational performance, an ongoing benefit from the company’s business transformation efforts and lower pension expenses.  

Full-year Financial Results  

Baxter’s 2018 worldwide sales totaled approximately $11.1 billion, an increase of 5 percent on a reported basis, 4 percent on a constant currency basis and 3 percent on an operational basis compared to 2017. Operational sales for 2018 adjust for the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for U.S. cyclophosphamide, the company’s March 2018 acquisition of two surgical products from Mallinckrodt plc, and the company’s July 2017 acquisition of Claris Injectables.

Sales in the U.S. totaled $4.7 billion, increasing 5 percent on a reported basis and 3 percent on an operational basis. International sales of $6.4 billion increased 6 percent on a reported basis and 4 percent on both a constant currency and operational basis.  

For the year, Baxter’s Pharmaceuticals, Advanced Surgery and Acute Therapies businesses delivered double-digit growth at constant currency rates; and Renal Care achieved mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. This growth helped offset low-single-digit declines in the company’s Medication Delivery and Clinical Nutrition businesses. The accompanying schedules include additional details on sales performance by geographic segment and GBU.  

Baxter reported 2018 income from continuing operations of $1.6 billion, or $2.99 per diluted share, on a GAAP basis. These results include special items totaling $36 million after-tax, primarily due to business optimization and intangible amortization, partially offset by a benefit related to the company’s U.S. foreign credit deferred tax assets. On an adjusted basis, Baxter’s 2018 income from continuing operations totaled $1.7 billion, or $3.05 per diluted share, an increase of 23 percent over the prior-year period.  

In 2018, Baxter generated $2.1 billion in operating cash flow, driven by improved operational performance and the continuing impact of programs focused on improving the company’s working capital. As a result, the company generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures of $681 million) for the year.  

“Baxter’s sustained improvement in cash generation gives us the flexibility to evaluate and pursue a growing range of organic and inorganic growth opportunities,” said Jay Saccaro, chief financial officer. “It also augments our ability to return value directly to our shareholders. In 2018, we increased our annual dividend rate by approximately 19 percent, paid out $376 million in dividends and repurchased over $2.4 billion in shares.”  

Business Highlights  

In 2018 Baxter achieved notable milestones in pursuit of its Mission for patients as well as its emphasis on accelerating profitable growth. Among highlights of the past year, the company:  

   •    Announced a collaboration with Mayo Clinic to establish a renal care center of excellence that will serve patients across the continuum of care, from chronic kidney disease (CKD) management through transplant, to drive better outcomes. The center will be located at Mayo Clinic’s Jacksonville, Fla., campus

   o  Amy A. Wendell, former Covidien senior vice president of strategy and business development, whose experience will be an asset as Baxter continues to evaluate potential inorganic growth opportunities  

Baxter’s progress continues into 2019, as reflected in additional highlights to open the year. Most recently the company:  

   •    Began patient treatments in the U.S. clinical trial for Baxter’s on-demand peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution generation system, an innovative technology designed to improve the patient experience and simplify therapy management by making PD solutions in small batches in the patient’s home  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition, Baxter continues to be recognized for its commitment to corporate social responsibility and workplace excellence. The company was recently:  

   •    Named by Forbes and Just Capital to the 2019 Just 100 list of America’s Best Corporate Citizens  

   •    Named to Forbes’ list of The Best Employers for Diversity 2019
