Operating Expenses 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth Quarter  

Operating expenses were $5.15 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, 9% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and 8% lower than the third quarter of 2018. 

The increase in operating expenses compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily reflected significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 also included $79 million related to the recently adopted revenue recognition standard (8) . These increases were partially offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses. 

Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $516 million compared with $9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. 

The fourth quarter of 2018 included a $132 million charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. Compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives.

    Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements    

This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only the firm’s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm’s control. It is possible that the firm’s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm’s future results and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” in Part I,

 Item 1A of the firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

Information regarding the firm’s capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, supplementary leverage ratio, total assets and balance sheet data, global core liquid assets and VaR consists of preliminary estimates. These estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.  

Statements about the firm’s investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm’s investment banking transactions, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The following reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation.    

•    

Provision for credit losses, previously reported in other principal transactions revenues (and Investing & Lending segment net revenues), is now reported as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.    

•    

Headcount consists of the firm’s employees, and excludes consultants and temporary staff previously reported as part of total staff. As a result, expenses related to consultants and temporary staff previously reported in compensation and benefits expenses are now reported in professional fees.    

•    

Regulatory-related fees that are paid to exchanges, reported in other expenses prior to 2018, are now reported in brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees.    

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Management believes that presenting the firm’s results excluding Tax Legislation is meaningful as excluding this item increases the comparability of period-to-period results. Diluted EPS and ROE, excluding the impact of Tax Legislation, are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The tables below present the calculation of net earnings applicable to common shareholders, diluted EPS and average common shareholders’ equity, excluding the impact of Tax Legislation (unaudited, in millions, except per share amounts):

Efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total operating expenses by total net revenues.    

   (10)  

Basic shares include common shares outstanding and restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements.    

   (11)  

Unvested share-based awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are treated as a separate class of securities in calculating EPS. The impact of applying this methodology was a reduction in basic EPS of $0.05 and $0.06 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and $0.01 for both the three months ended December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018. The impact of applying this methodology for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was a loss per common share (basic and diluted) of $0.01.    

   (12)  

Included $23 billion of inflows ($20 billion in long-term assets under supervision and $3 billion in liquidity products) in connection with the acquisition of a portion of Verus Investors’ outsourced chief investment officer business and $5 billion of equity asset outflows in connection with the divestiture of the firm’s local Australian-focused investment capabilities and fund platform.
