On January 16, 2019, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company approved, effective January 17, 2019, the appointment of Christopher M.T. Thompson as its lead independent director replacing Linda Fayne Levinson following the expiration of her term as lead independent director on January 16, 2019. 

Authorization of Share Repurchase Program

On January 17, 2019, the Board authorized an incremental $1 billion share repurchase program. The duration of the new share repurchase program is three years. The exact number of shares, the timing of such purchases and the price and terms at and on which such purchases are made will be determined from time to time at the discretion of the Company and there can be no assurance of repurchases, as they depend upon a variety of factors including changes in market conditions and 

economic circumstances, availability of investment opportunities, uncertainties relating to the availability and costs of our financing needs in the future, currency fluctuations, the market price of the Company’s common stock and the suspension or discontinuation of the share repurchase program, among others. 

Dividend 

On January 17, 2019, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend payable to shareholders in the amount of $0.17 per share of the Company’s common stock. This represents a 13% increase in the quarterly dividend. This dividend will be paid on March 15, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2019. Future dividend payments are subject to review and approval by the Board.
