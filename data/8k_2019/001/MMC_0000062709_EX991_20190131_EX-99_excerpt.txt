Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 

Includes Revenue Standard Impact

(Millions) (Unaudited)

Overview

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (referred to in this release as "GAAP" or "reported" results). The Company also refers to and presents below certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, adjusted income, net of tax and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP in the following tables.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that enables investors to better compare the Company’s performance across periods. Management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its businesses, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. However, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses, and may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating Margin

Adjusted operating income (loss) is calculated by excluding the impact of certain noteworthy items from the Company's GAAP operating income or (loss). The following tables identify these noteworthy items and reconcile adjusted operating income (loss) to GAAP operating income or loss, on a consolidated and segment basis, for the three months ended December 31, 2018. The following tables also present adjusted operating margin. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by consolidated or segment GAAP revenue adjusted for the subsidiary or affiliate transactions discussed below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Includes severance and related charges from restructuring activities, adjustments to restructuring liabilities for future rent under non-cancellable leases and other real estate costs, and restructuring costs related to the integration of recent acquisitions. Reflects severance and consulting costs relating to the Marsh simplification initiative and Mercer's business restructure.

(b) Primarily includes the change in fair value as measured each quarter of contingent consideration related to acquisitions.

(c) Primarily related to legal and consulting costs in connection with the JLT acquisition.

(d) Dispositions or deconsolidation of businesses and results of certain equity method investments are reflected as an increase or decrease of other revenue, which is reflected as part of revenue in the consolidated statements of income. These items are removed from GAAP revenue in the calculation of adjusted operating margin.

Note:

Comparative financial information for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is presented on page 10.

(a) Mark-to-market adjustments for investments classified as available for sale under prior guidance were recorded to equity, net of tax. Beginning January 1, 2018 such adjustments must be recorded as part of investment income. Prior periods were not restated. The Company excludes such mark-to-market gains or losses from its calculation of adjusted earnings per share. The Company recorded mark-to-market gains of $8 million and $54 million for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018, respectively, which are included in Investment Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The Company has an investment in Alexander Forbes (“AF”), which is accounted for using the equity method. AF’s shares (which are publicly traded on the Johannesburg stock exchange) have been trading below the Company’s carrying value. Based on the extent of and duration over which the shares have traded below the Company’s carrying value, the Company determined the decline was other than temporary and in the third quarter recorded a charge of $83 million in Investment loss.

(b) Pension settlement charge resulting from lump sum settlements elected by participants in primarily certain U.K. pension plans. Recognition of these payments as a partial settlement was required because in each respective plan the lump sum payments exceeded the total of interest and service cost for the year.
