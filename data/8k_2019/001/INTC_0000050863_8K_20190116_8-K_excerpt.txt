 Item 5.03  

Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On January 16, 2019, the Board of Directors (“Board”) of Intel Corporation (“Intel” or the “Company”) approved amendments to the Intel Corporation Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), effective immediately, to reduce the minimum aggregate stock ownership required for stockholders to call a special meeting from twenty-five percent (25%) to fifteen percent (15%) and add a new Article XIII, Forum for Adjudication of Disputes.  

Article II, Section 3 of the Company’s Bylaws, as amended, provides that special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation shall be called by the Board upon written request to the Corporate Secretary of stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting.  

New Article XIII provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Delaware Court of Chancery will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company to the Company or to the Company’s stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) or the Company’s certificate of incorporation or Bylaws, (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware, or (v) any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. The new Article XIII of the Bylaws further provides, among other provisions, that the sole and exclusive forum for any action or proceeding over which the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction will be the federal district court for the District of Delaware.  

The foregoing description of the amendments to the Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bylaws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.
