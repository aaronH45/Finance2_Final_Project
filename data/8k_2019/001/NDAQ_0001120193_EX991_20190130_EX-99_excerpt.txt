The company is announcing an offer to acquire Oslo Børs VPS and combine it with Nasdaq’s leading Nordic markets.  

   •    

During 2018, the company returned $674 million to shareholders, including repurchases of common shares valued at $394 million and $280 million in dividends.  

New York, N.Y.- Nasdaq, Inc. (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.  

2018 net revenues were $2,526 million, an increase of $115 million, or 5%, from $2,411 million in the prior year period. The full year increase in net revenues included a $188 million increase due to organic growth, a $59 million positive impact from the inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of eVestment net of a purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue, and a $7 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by $139 million negative impact from the divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses. Fourth quarter 2018 net revenues were $645 million, up $15 million from $630 million in the prior year period. The fourth quarter increase in net revenues included a positive $67 million, or 11%, impact from organic growth, and a positive $6 million impact from the inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of eVestment, partially offset by a $50 million negative impact from the divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses and a $8 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.  

“We are pleased by our progress this year, especially the strong organic revenue growth we achieved across all our business segments. Importantly, our strategic direction coupled with a renewed client focus, has resulted in materially higher client engagement across all of our businesses,” said Adena Friedman, President and CEO, Nasdaq.  

“As we begin 2019, we are continuing to execute on our strategy, first with the pivot to maximize opportunities as a technology and analytics provider through our acquisitions of Cinnober and Quandl and second by enhancing our marketplace core through our offer to combine Oslo Børs VPS’ leading Norwegian exchange and depository capabilities with our leading Nordic marketplace complex. We believe these strategic acquisitions will be additive to our organic growth efforts and important drivers of the value we deliver to our clients and shareholders.”

Refer to our reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating income and operating expenses, included in the attached schedules.  

1   

GAAP operating expenses were $404 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $14 million from $390 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase primarily reflects higher general, administrative and other expense, partially offset by lower merger and strategic initiatives expense and professional and contract services expense.  

Non-GAAP operating expenses were $330 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $9 million, or 3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This reflects a $5 million increase from the acquisition of eVestment and a $25 million organic expense increase, more than offset by a $32 million decrease due to the divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses and a $7 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.  

“As we ended 2018 and began 2019, we have continued the deliberate strategic reallocation of our resources to support our largest growth opportunities, as evidenced by the acquisitions of Cinnober and Quandl, and the sale of our ownership stake in LCH Group Holdings Limited in the fourth quarter of 2018,” said Michael Ptasznik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Nasdaq. “While the acquisition of Oslo Børs VPS would require a temporary, moderate increase in leverage, it will not change our capital allocation priorities. We remain dedicated to maintaining our investment grade rating, growing the dividend as our earnings increase, while continuing our share repurchase program and return on investment capital requirement target.”  

On a GAAP basis, net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $44 million, or a diluted loss per share of $0.27, compared with net income of $246 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an $89 million benefit for our provisional estimate of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We finalized the impact in the fourth quarter of 2018 based on updated information, including subsequent guidance issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and recorded a $289 million non-cash tax charge, reducing deferred tax assets relating to foreign currency translation. This tax charge impacted GAAP diluted EPS by $1.76 per share. Additionally, for the three months ended December 2018, we recorded a $23 million charge associated with the capital relief program relating to our Nordic clearing business, where we will allocate capital back to default fund participants. The capital relief program is in addition to any funds to be recovered from the defaulting member.  

On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $211 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to $177 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 21% increase in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share year over year.  

At December 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $545 million and total debt of $3,831 million, resulting in net debt of $3,286 million. This compares to total debt of $4,207 million and net debt of $3,830 million at December 31, 2017.  

Repurchases of common stock totaled $394 million during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, there was $332 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.  

INITIATING 2019 NON-GAAP EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE1  

The company is initiating its 2019 non-GAAP operating expense guidance of $1,325 to $1,375 million. The guidance includes expenses associated with the acquisitions of Cinnober and Quandl. Nasdaq expects its 2019 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27%.  

 1   

U.S. GAAP operating expense is not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  

Market Services (39% of total net revenues) - Net revenues were $249 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $27 million, or 12%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.  

Equity Derivatives Trading and Clearing (13% of total net revenues) - Net equity derivative trading and clearing revenues were $82 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $19 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase primarily reflects higher U.S. options industry trading volumes and net capture rate, partially offset by lower U.S. market share.  

Cash Equity Trading (12% of total net revenues) - Net cash equity trading revenues were $76 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $11 million from the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase primarily reflects higher U.S. and European equity industry trading volumes, higher U.S. equity market share, partially offset by a lower net U.S. capture rate and an unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates of $2 million from our European equities business.  

Fixed Income and Commodities Trading and Clearing (3% of total net revenues) - Net fixed income and commodities trading and clearing revenues were $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, down $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a decline in revenues related to U.S. fixed income and Nordic commodities products, partially offset by higher net revenues at NFX.  

Trade Management Services (11% of total net revenues) - Trade management services revenues were $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, down $1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to an unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates of $1 million.  

Corporate Services (20% of total net revenues) - Revenues were $133 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $2 million, or 2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.  

Listing Services (11% of total net revenues) - Listing services revenues were $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $4 million from the fourth quarter of 2017. The change reflects a $5 million organic increase, resulting from client adoption of our all-inclusive annual listing fee program and an increase in the number and size of IPOs, partially offset by the run-off of fees earned from listing of additional shares.  

Corporate Solutions (9% of total net revenues) - Corporate solutions revenues were $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, down $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, with organic growth in board and leadership revenues more than offset by a decrease in governance, risk and compliance revenues.  

Information Services (29% of total net revenues) - Revenues were $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $31 million, or 20%, from the fourth quarter of 2017.  

Market Data (15% of total net revenues) - Market data revenues were $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to growth in our share of U.S. tape plans, and revenues from sales of data subscriptions in Asian and European data products.  

Index (8% of total net revenues) - Index revenues were $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $8 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily driven by higher average assets under management (AUM) in exchange traded products (ETPs) linked to Nasdaq indexes and higher licensing revenue from futures trading related to the Nasdaq 100 Index.  

3   

Investment Data and Analytics (6% of total net revenues) - Investment data and analytics revenues were $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $19 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 due to a positive $10 million impact from a lower purchase price adjustment on eVestment deferred revenue, a $6 million impact from the acquisition of eVestment completed in October 2017 and organic growth in eVestment.  

Market Technology (12% of total net revenues) - Revenues were $76 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $5 million, or 7%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The change reflects 8% organic growth due to increases in software delivery and support revenues and higher software as a service revenues, partially offset by lower change requests and advisory revenues and an unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates of 1%. In 2018, Market Technology revenues increased 9% compared to 2017, resulting from 10% organic growth partially offset by a 1% reduction from unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.

Market Services delivered record net revenue in 2018 through a combination of strong competitive positioning and improved industry volumes. Market Services set a new annual record with net revenues of $958 million in 2018 including all-time highs in both cash equities and equity derivatives. In 2018, Nasdaq’s Market Services segment maximized the opportunity of multi-year industry market volume highs in U.S. equity options in part because of the successful 2016-2017 integration of the ISE options exchange, and in U.S. equities through increases in market share to 19.5%1. On the innovation side, Market Services clients in 2018 benefited from new functionality such as M-ELO order types and a refined closing cross to provide more flexibility in the U.S. equity market, Auction on Demand functionality in the Nordic equities market, and the upgrade of the Nasdaq Fixed Income (NFI) platform to the Nasdaq Financial Framework.

NON-GAAP INFORMATION  

In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, net income attributable to Nasdaq, diluted earnings per share, operating income, and operating expenses, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at the end of this release. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.  

These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.  

We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating expenses to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.  

Foreign exchange impact: In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.

Nasdaq cautions readers that any forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information.
