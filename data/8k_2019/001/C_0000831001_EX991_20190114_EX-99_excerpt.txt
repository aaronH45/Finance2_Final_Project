  FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2018 RESULTS AND KEY METRICS        

FOURTH QUARTER 2018: 

NET INCOME OF $4.3 BILLION ($1.64 PER SHARE) 

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF TAX REFORM5, NET INCOME OF $4.2 BILLION ($1.61 PER SHARE) 

REVENUES OF $17.1 BILLION 

RETURNED $5.8 BILLION OF CAPITAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS ($18.4 BILLION IN FULL YEAR 2018) 

REPURCHASED 74 MILLION COMMON SHARES (212 MILLION IN FULL YEAR 2018) 

BOOK VALUE PER SHARE OF $75.05

 TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE OF $63.796 

New York, January 14, 2019 — Citigroup Inc. today reported net income for the fourth quarter 2018 of $4.3 billion, or $1.64 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.1 billion. This compared to a net loss of $18.9 billion, or $7.38 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.5 billion for the fourth quarter 2017. 

Fourth quarter 2017 included a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion, or $8.66 per share, recorded in the tax line related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). Fourth quarter 2018 included a one-time benefit of $94 million, or $0.03 per share, recorded in the tax line in Corporate / Other, due to the finalization of the provisional component of the impact based on Citi’s analysis as well as additional guidance received from the U.S. Treasury Department related to Tax Reform. Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform in both the current and the prior-year periods, net income of $4.2 billion increased 14%, primarily driven by a reduction in expenses, lower cost of credit and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower revenues. On this basis, earnings per share of $1.61 increased 26% from $1.28 per diluted share in the prior-year period, driven by the growth in net income and an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. 

CEO COMMENTARY 

Citi CEO Michael Corbat said, “We made solid progress throughout 2018 towards our longer-term financial targets, ending the year with an RoTCE of 10.9% and an efficiency ratio of 57%. Our institutional and consumer franchises each grew revenue on a full year basis and we continued to invest in our people and technology in order to better serve our clients. During the year, we also grew loans and deposits, improved ROA, and carefully managed both our expenses and balance sheet. We also returned more than $18 billion of capital to common shareholders. 

“A volatile fourth quarter impacted some of our market sensitive businesses, particularly Fixed Income. However, our ICG accrual businesses — Treasury and Trade Solutions, Securities Services, Private Bank and Corporate Lending — continued their strong performance. And in Global Consumer Banking, we had good underlying growth in U.S. Branded Cards and solid performance from our franchise in Mexico where we have been investing. For 2019, we remain committed to delivering a 12% RoTCE and continuing to improve our operating efficiency during the year,” Mr. Corbat concluded.

For the full year 2018, Citigroup reported net income of $18.0 billion on revenues of $72.9 billion, compared to a net loss of $6.8 billion on revenues of $72.4 billion for the full year 2017. Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform, Citigroup net income of $18.0 billion increased 14% compared to the prior year.

Citigroup 

Citigroup revenues of $17.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2018 decreased 2%, primarily reflecting lower revenues in Fixed Income Markets within the Institutional Clients Group (ICG), as well as the wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate / Other.

Citigroup cost of credit in the fourth quarter 2018 was $1.9 billion, a 7% decrease, primarily driven by an episodic charge-off in ICG in the prior-year period.

Citigroup’s SLR for the fourth quarter 2018 was 6.4%, down from 6.5% in the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter 2018, Citigroup repurchased 74 million common shares and returned a total of $5.8 billion to common shareholders in the form of common share repurchases and dividends.

1 Citigroup’s total expenses divided by total revenues. 

2 Preliminary. Citigroup’s return on average tangible common equity (RoTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. RoTCE represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity (TCE). Citigroup’s 2018 RoTCE of 10.9% excludes the one-time impact of Tax Reform in 4Q’18. For the components of the calculation, see Appendix A. 

3 Ratios as of December 31, 2018 are preliminary. Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio and Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) reflect full implementation of the U.S. Basel III rules for all periods. As of December 31, 2017, these ratios are non-GAAP financial measures, which reflect full implementation of regulatory capital adjustments and deductions prior to the effective date of January 1, 2018. For the composition of Citigroup’s CET1 Capital and ratio, see Appendix C. For the composition of Citigroup’s SLR, see Appendix D. 

4 Citigroup’s payout ratio is the sum of common dividends and common share repurchases divided by net income available to common shareholders. Citigroup’s 2018 payout ratio of 110% excludes the one-time impact of Tax Reform in 4Q’18. For the components of the calculation, see Appendix A. 

5 Represents the fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 one-time impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, as well as the fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 one-time impact of the finalization of the provisional component of the impact based on Citi’s analysis as well as additional guidance received from the U.S. Treasury Department related to Tax Reform. For the components of the calculation, see Appendix A. 

6 Citigroup’s tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of this measure to reported results, see Appendix E. 

7 Results of operations excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation (constant dollar basis) are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to reported results, see Appendices A and B. 

8 Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains / (losses) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains / (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.
