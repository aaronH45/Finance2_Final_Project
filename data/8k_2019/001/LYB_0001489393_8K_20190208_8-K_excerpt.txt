 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On February 8, 2019, LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (the “Company”), as guarantor, and LYB Americas Finance Company LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as borrower (the “Borrower”), various financial institutions as lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, entered into a 364-Day Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $2.0 billion senior unsecured term loan credit facility that matures on February 7, 2020. The Borrower borrowed the entire $2.0 billion under the Credit Agreement on February 8, 2019.

Proceeds of the term loans made under the Credit Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of indebtedness. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, LIBOR plus the applicable margin and (ii) with respect to Base Rate Loans, the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by reference to the Company’s current credit ratings and will be in the range of 0.600% to 1.100% for Eurodollar Rate Loans and the range of 0% to 0.100% for Base Rate Loans. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.750% for Eurodollar Rate Loans and 0% for Base Rate Loans.

The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of each of the Company and the Borrower. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and contains certain restrictive covenants regarding, among other things, secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness, and mergers and sales of assets, all substantially consistent with our $2,500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The term loans are not subject to any mandatory prepayment requirements, and may be prepaid at the option of the Borrower at any time (subject to customary notice and minimum amount requirements) without premium or penalty. 

The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal when due, nonpayment of interest or other amounts after a customary grace period, violation of covenants (subject, in the case of certain of such covenants, to a 30-day grace period), incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect, cross acceleration to terms of material indebtedness and cross payment default, bankruptcy or other insolvency events of the Company or its material subsidiaries (with a customary grace period for involuntary events), material monetary judgments, ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of loan documents and changes of control. 

A copy of the Credit Agreement is included in this Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The summary description of the Credit Agreement in this report does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.1.
