NEW YORK, January 29, 2019 - L3 Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: LLL) today reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $2.83 and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $3.10 for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 (2018 fourth quarter). Adjusted diluted EPS excludes merger and acquisition related expenses of $0.24 per diluted share and adjustments to divestiture gains of $0.03 per diluted share. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (2017 fourth quarter) was $3.34. The 2017 fourth quarter results included an estimated tax benefit of $79 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform) in December 2017. Net sales of $2,771 million for the 2018 fourth quarter increased by 8% compared to the 2017 fourth quarter.

“We performed well in the fourth quarter, ending 2018 with growth in sales, operating income, adjusted EPS, free cash flow, orders and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.13,” said Christopher E. Kubasik, L3’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. “Segment operating margin was 10.8%, flat compared to 2017, which was lower than expected primarily due to performance in our traveling wave tube businesses, as well as some sales mix changes. However, we remain on track for 12 percent operating margin in 2019 as we advance our L365 continuous improvement and productivity initiatives. On the pending merger with Harris Corporation, we expect to complete the merger mid-year 2019 and would like to thank our employees for staying focused on our customers while we move forward with our integration activities.”

__________________________ 

(1) Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and represents diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding debt retirement charges, merger and acquisition related expenses, and divestiture gains (Crestview & TCS businesses). The company believes that debt retirement charges, merger and acquisition related expenses, and divestiture gains affect the comparability of the results of operations and that disclosing diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding these items is useful to investors as it allows investors to more easily compare 2018 results to 2017 results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be defined or calculated by other companies in the same manner.

Fourth Quarter Results of Operations: For the 2018 fourth quarter, consolidated net sales of $2,771 million increased $197 million, or 8%, compared to the 2017 fourth quarter. Organic sales(2) increased by $182 million, or 7%, to $2,731 million for the 2018 fourth quarter. Organic sales exclude $40 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions and $25 million of sales declines related to business divestitures.  For the 2018 fourth quarter, organic sales to the U.S. Government increased $145 million, or 8%, to $1,935 million, and organic sales to international and commercial customers increased $37 million, or 5%, to $796 million. 

Segment operating income for the 2018 fourth quarter increased by $33 million, or 12%, compared to the 2017 fourth quarter. Segment operating income as a percentage of sales (segment operating margin) increased by 50 basis points to 10.9% for the 2018 fourth quarter from 10.4% for the 2017 fourth quarter. Favorable contract performance at Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (ISRS) and Electronic Systems and lower severance and restructuring costs, primarily at Communications and Networked Systems (C&NS) were partially offset by lower manufacturing yields, inventory provisions and unfavorable contract performance for the Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) business in C&NS. 

See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends.

The effective income tax rate for the 2018 fourth quarter was a provision of 5.3%, compared to a benefit of 19.9% for the 2017 fourth quarter. The increase was driven by lower tax benefits in the 2018 fourth quarter from U.S. Tax Reform partially offset by the reversal of previously accrued amounts related to various U.S. Federal, foreign and state tax matters.

Full Year Results of Operations: For the year ended December 31, 2018, consolidated net sales of $10,244 million increased $671 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Organic sales increased by $635 million, or 7%, to $10,138 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Organic sales exclude $106 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions and $70 million of sales declines related to business divestitures. For the year ended December 31, 2018, organic sales to the U.S. Government increased $428 million, or 6%, to $7,072 million, and organic sales to international and commercial customers increased $207 million, or 7%, to $3,066 million. 

Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $75 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Segment operating margin was 10.8% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Favorable contract performance at Electronic Systems were offset by lower manufacturing yields, inventory provisions and unfavorable contract performance for the TWT business in C&NS and higher research and development costs, primarily at ISRS.

See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends.

The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to 11.1%, compared to 11.7% for the same period last year due to a lower U.S. federal statutory tax rate, higher tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the reversal of previously accrued amounts related to various U.S. Federal, foreign and state tax matters.

Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $10.05 and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $10.75 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted diluted EPS excludes: (1) debt retirement charges of $0.66 per diluted share, (2) merger and acquisition related expenses of $0.28 per diluted share and (3) a gain of $0.24 per diluted share related to divestitures. Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.46 and included

(2) Organic sales represent net sales excluding the sales impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Sales increases related to acquired businesses are sales from acquisitions that are included in L3’s actual results for less than 12 months. Sales declines related to business divestitures are sales from divestitures that are included in L3’s actual results for the 12 months prior to the divestitures. The company believes organic sales is a useful measure for investors because it provides period-to-period comparisons of the company’s ongoing operational and financial performance.

$0.99 per diluted share of estimated tax benefits related to U.S. Tax Reform. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 were substantially unchanged compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.
