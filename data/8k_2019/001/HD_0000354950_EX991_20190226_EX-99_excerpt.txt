Increases Quarterly Dividend by 32.0 Percent;

Announces $15.0 Billion Share Repurchase Authorization;

Provides Fiscal 2019 Guidance

ATLANTA, February 26, 2019 -- The Home Depot®, the world's largest home improvement retailer, today reported sales of $26.5 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a 10.9 percent increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were positive 3.2 percent, and comp sales in the U.S. were positive 3.7 percent. 

The fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 consisted of 14 weeks compared with 13 weeks for the prior year. The 14th week added approximately $1.7 billion in sales for the quarter and the year. The additional week is not included in comparable sales results for the quarter or the year. 

Net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $2.3 billion, or $2.09 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $1.8 billion, or $1.52 per diluted share, in the same period of fiscal 2017. The 14th week added approximately $0.21 per diluted share for the quarter and year. 

Net earnings for the fourth quarter and the year were negatively impacted by a nonrecurring, pre-tax charge of approximately $247 million, or $184 million after tax equaling $0.16 per diluted share, due to an impairment loss related to certain trade names at Interline Brands. 

Fiscal 2018

Sales for fiscal 2018 were $108.2 billion, an increase of 7.2 percent from fiscal 2017. Total company comparable sales for fiscal 2018 increased 5.2 percent, and comp sales in the U.S. were positive 5.4 percent for the year. 

Earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2018 were $9.73, compared to $7.29 per diluted share in fiscal 2017, an increase of 33.5 percent. 

“We achieved record sales and net earnings in fiscal 2018, while making great progress on the strategic investments we laid out in December of 2017. We focused on enhancing the interconnected retail experience for our customers, providing localized and innovative product, and delivering best in class productivity,” said Craig Menear, chairman, CEO and president. “Our view on the health of the economy and the consumer, as well as the momentum of our strategic investments, supports our belief that we can deliver comparable sales growth of 5.0 percent in fiscal 2019. I would like to thank our associates for their solid execution and exceptional work in service to our customers.”

Dividend Declaration and Share Repurchase Authorization 

The Company today announced that its board of directors declared a 32.0 percent increase in its quarterly dividend to $1.36 per share.

The dividend is payable on March 28, 2019, to shareholders of record on the close of business on March 14, 2019. This is the 128th consecutive quarter the Company has paid a cash dividend.
