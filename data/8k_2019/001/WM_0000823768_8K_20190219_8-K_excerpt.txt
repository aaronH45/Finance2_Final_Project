On February 19, 2019, the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Waste Management, Inc. (the “Company”) granted equity awards under the Company’s 2014 Stock Incentive Plan to each of the Company’s currently-serving named executive officers (collectively, the “Executives”). 

Each of the Executives, which includes James C. Fish, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer; John J. Morris, Jr., Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Devina A. Rankin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, received performance share units and stock options. The number of performance share units granted to each of the Executives is as follows: Mr. Fish — 58,948; Mr. Morris — 18,526 and Ms. Rankin — 16,842. The material terms of the performance share units are described below.  

  Performance Share Units           

  Performance Calculation Date (“PCD”)       As of December 31, 2021; award (if any) paid out after completion of the audit of the Company’s 2021 year-end financial statements and certification by the Committee of actual level of achievement (“payment date”).   

  Performance Measure       50% of the PSUs will have an adjusted free cash flow performance measure, and 50% of the PSUs will have a total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 performance measure, in each case as set forth in the award agreement filed as an exhibit hereto.   

  Range of Possible Awards       0 — 200% of targeted amount, plus accrued dividend equivalents, based on actual results achieved.
