“Our fourth quarter performance capped off 2018 on a positive note, with continued strong and differentiated results for our shareholders,” said Michael W. Lamach, chairman and chief executive officer of Ingersoll Rand. “Our highly engaged team and disciplined execution of our strategy delivered another quarter of excellent bookings and revenue growth, solid leverage and healthy margin expansion across the enterprise and in each of our business segments. My thanks to our global team members for serving our customers and generating strong financial results. 

Free cash flow conversion of 82 percent of adjusted net income was below our expectation of 100 percent conversion primarily driven by funding higher than normal working capital levels necessary to meet customer demand and support our exceptional bookings and revenue growth. Over the past four years our free cash flow has averaged 110 percent of adjusted net income and we expect to deliver greater than 100 percent free cash flow conversion in 2019."

Lamach continued, "Looking at 2019, we believe we have the fundamental ingredients for another year of strong financial performance. We enter the year with favorable end markets, record levels of backlog and a proven business operating system that enables us to effectively manage inflation, tariffs and other risks while driving continued margin expansion and delivering powerful cash flow to execute our dynamic capital allocation strategy.”

Highlights from the Fourth Quarter of 2018 (all comparisons against the fourth quarter of 2017 unless otherwise noted)

•Strong organic bookings and revenue growth delivered across virtually all businesses, products and geographies. 

•The company drove exceptional bookings growth with reported bookings growth of 16 percent and organic bookings growth of 17 percent. The company booked a large Commercial HVAC order in the quarter. Excluding this order, enterprise reported and organic bookings growth was 11 percent. The organic bookings growth rates accelerated despite difficult comparisons, with high growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, up 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively. 

•The company drove good revenue growth in both aftermarket (services and parts) and equipment, each up 8 percent.

•Enterprise reported revenue growth included approximately 1 percentage point of growth from acquisitions offset by approximately 1 percentage point negative foreign exchange impact.

•The company also drove solid operating margin expansion, with reported margins up 80 basis points, adjusted margins up 90 basis points. Strong volume, improved pricing and productivity improvements

were partially offset by material inflation, tariff-related and other inflation and ongoing business investments. 

•Below the operating income line, other income / (expense), net included discrete expenses of approximately $12 million related to legacy legal matters.

•The company’s fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate* of 16.5 percent was lower than the company’s guidance of approximately 21 percent, primarily driven by the favorable resolution of a number of discrete tax items in the quarter.

Fourth-quarter Business Review (all comparisons against the fourth quarter of 2017 unless otherwise noted)

Climate Segment: delivers energy-efficient products and innovative energy services. The segment includes Trane® and American Standard® Heating & Air Conditioning which provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and commercial and residential building services, parts, support and controls; energy services and building automation through Trane Building Advantage™ and Nexia™; and Thermo King® transport temperature control solutions.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The company's Climate segment delivered exceptional bookings growth, with reported and organic bookings both up 20 percent, and included a large Commercial HVAC order. Excluding this order bookings growth remained outstanding, with reported and organic bookings each up 13 percent. These organic growth rates accelerated against difficult comparisons, with high growth rates in both the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, up 7 percent and 10 percent, respectively. 

•The Climate segment also delivered robust reported and organic revenue growth, each up 9 percent.

•Revenue growth was broad-based in all businesses and regions with good growth in both aftermarket and equipment, each up 9 percent.

•Climate reported revenue growth included approximately 1 percentage point of growth from acquisitions offset by approximately 1 percentage point of negative foreign exchange impact.

•The Climate segment also drove solid operating margin expansion, with reported margins up 30 basis points and adjusted margins up 40 basis points. Strong volume, improved pricing and productivity improvements were partially offset by material inflation, tariff-related and other inflation and ongoing business investments.

Industrial Segment: delivers products and services that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. The segment includes compressed air and gas systems and services, power tools, material handling systems, ARO® fluid management equipment, as well as Club Car® golf, utility and consumer low-speed vehicles.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The company's Industrial segment delivered solid bookings growth, with reported and organic bookings up 4 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Organic growth was healthy in the fourth quarter against a difficult comparison of 12 percent organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

•The Industrial segment also delivered solid reported and organic revenue growth, up 4 percent and 6 percent, respectively.

•The Industrial segment drove broad-based revenue growth in all businesses and all regions. The Compression Technologies business continues to drive a higher aftermarket mix with aftermarket outpacing equipment growth in the quarter. 

•Industrial reported revenue growth included approximately 2 percentage points of negative foreign exchange impact.

•Operating margin expansion was solid with reported margins down 20 basis points including restructuring. Margins excluding restructuring were up 40 basis points. Strong volume, improved pricing and productivity improvements were partially offset by material inflation, tariff-related and other inflation and ongoing business investments. 

•Operating leverage was lower than expected in the quarter outside of the Compression Technologies business where leverage was in excess of 40 percent. Lower than expected leverage was primarily the result of discrete accrual adjustments and a legal settlement in the Industrial Products group (Tools, Material Handling and Fluid Management) and small electric vehicles totaling approximately $5 million. The Industrial segment will continue to deliver healthy leverage in 2019.

Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Capital Allocation

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Fiscal year 2018 free cash flow of $1.15 billion equaled 82 percent of adjusted net income, below the company's target of 100 percent of adjusted net income primarily related to the company funding additional working capital to sustain continued high levels of bookings and revenue in the fourth quarter. Higher capital expenditures to fund long-term business investments also contributed to the free cash flow shortfall. The company continues to drive high-quality earnings and cash flow and expects to deliver free cash flow in excess of 100 percent of adjusted net income in 2019.

•During 2018, the company deployed $285 million in acquisitions and returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders with $480 million in dividends and $900 million in share repurchases.

Full-Year 2019 Guidance 

•Revenues up 4 percent to 5 percent; organic revenues up 5 percent to 6 percent compared with 2018.

•Continuing EPS of $5.90 to $6.10, including EPS of $(0.25) for restructuring; adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $6.15 to $6.35.

•Average diluted shares of approximately 244 million which assumes approximately $500 million in share repurchases in 2019 for modeling purposes.

•Adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 21 percent to 22 percent.

•Free cash flow greater than adjusted net income.

•Balanced capital allocation targeting 100 percent of free cash flow deployment is expected to include a strong dividend that grows at or above the rate of adjusted net income growth, strategic acquisitions and share repurchase.

Adjusted operating income is defined as GAAP operating income plus restructuring expenses in 2018 and 2017. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.

Adjusted operating margin is defined as the ratio of adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.

Adjusted net income is defined as adjusted earnings from continuing operations attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc in 2018 and 2017. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.

In 2018, Adjusted continuing EPS is defined as GAAP continuing EPS plus restructuring expenses, net of tax impacts plus non-cash tax reform measurement period adjustments less a discrete non-cash tax adjustment in the U.S. In 2017, Adjusted continuing EPS is defined as GAAP continuing EPS plus restructuring expenses, net of tax impacts less U.S. tax legislation and other discrete items. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.

Free cash flow in 2018 and 2017 is defined as net cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus cash payments for restructuring. In 2018, the Company updated its definition of free cash flow to exclude the impacts of discontinued operations. As a result, free cash flow amounts in 2017 have been restated to conform with the current year definition. Please refer to the free cash flow reconciliation on table 9 of the news release. 

Working capital measures a firm’s operating liquidity position and its overall effectiveness in managing the enterprises’ current accounts. 

•Working capital is calculated by adding net accounts and notes receivables and inventories and subtracting total current liabilities that exclude short term debt, dividend payables and income tax payables. 

•Working capital as a percent of revenue is calculated by dividing the working capital balance (e.g. as of December 31) by the annualized revenue for the period (e.g. reported revenues for the three months ended December 31) multiplied by 4 to annualize for a full year.

Adjusted effective tax rate for 2018 is defined as the ratio of income tax expense plus the tax effect of adjustments for restructuring expenses plus the discrete non-cash tax adjustment in the U.S. less non-cash tax reform measurement period adjustments, divided by earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus restructuring expenses. Adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 is defined as the ratio of income tax benefit plus less the tax effect of adjustments for restructuring expenses less U.S. tax legislation and other discrete items, divided by earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus restructuring expenses. This measure allows for a direct comparison of the effective tax rate between periods.
