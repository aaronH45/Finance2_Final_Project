WILMINGTON, Mass.— February 16, 2021 —Analog Devices, Inc.

ADI has paid a dividend for 69 consecutive quarters, totaling $7 billion of cash returned to shareholders through dividends.

The increase is effective with the dividend payable on March 9, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 26, 2021. The payment of any future quarterly dividends, or a future increase in the quarterly dividend amount, will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon ADI's financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
