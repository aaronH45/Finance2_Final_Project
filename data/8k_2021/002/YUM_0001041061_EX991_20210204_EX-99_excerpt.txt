DAVID GIBBS & CHRIS TURNER COMMENTS

David Gibbs, CEO, said “Yum! enters 2021 a stronger company primed to profitably grow system sales this year and beyond. Despite the challenges of 2020, our full-year results demonstrated our resilience and validated the strategies we put in place during the transformation of Yum!. We intensified our focus on leveraging our scale and reinforcing our growth model, by accelerating our investments in digital and technology to enhance the customer experience and unit economics. In 2020, digital sales hit a record of $17 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year and a testament to our brands’ ability to quickly meet new consumer needs. I am more confident than ever in the ability of our teams and franchisees to compete and win in a rapidly changing world.”

Chris Turner, CFO, said “Q4 results are evidence our brands remain effectively positioned to win in an off-premise environment and that our business model is positioned for sustained rapid growth once we emerge from the pandemic. Overall Q4 system sales declined 2%, including a 3% headwind of the 53rd week in 2019, with slightly positive net units year-over-year and a 1% same-store sales decline. With iconic category-leading brands and a uniquely diversified global portfolio of over 50,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to grow and maximize value creation for all our stakeholders for years to come.”

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

In addition to the results provided in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), the Company provides the following non-GAAP measurements.

•Diluted Earnings Per Share ("EPS") excluding Special Items (as defined below);

•Effective Tax Rate excluding Special Items;

•Core Operating Profit and Core Operating Profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2019. Core Operating Profit excludes Special Items and FX and we use Core Operating Profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally.

These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.

Special Items are not included in any of our Division segment results as the Company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature. Our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of Special Items when assessing segment performance. The Special Items are described in (a) - (k) in the accompanying notes.

Certain non-GAAP measurements are presented excluding the impact of FX. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the FX impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.

For 2019 we provided Core Operating Profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week to further enhance the comparability given the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2019.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Consolidated Balance Sheets

and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

(amounts in millions)

(unaudited)

Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2020 are preliminary.

(a)We have reflected as Special Items those refranchising gains and losses that were recorded in connection with our previously announced plans to have at least 98% franchise restaurant ownership by the end of 2018. As such, refranchising gains and losses recorded during 2020 and 2019 as Special Items primarily include true-ups to refranchising gains and losses recorded prior to December 31, 2018.

During the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded net refranchising losses of less than $1 million and $6 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded net refranchising gains of $8 million and $12 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items.

Additionally, during the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded net refranchising gains of $4 million and $25 million, respectively, that have not been reflected as Special Items. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded net refranchising gains of $26 million and $25 million, respectively, that have not been reflected as Special Items. These net gains relate to the refranchising of restaurants that were not part of our aforementioned plans to achieve 98% franchise ownership.

(b)During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded Special Item charges of $9 million and $1 million, respectively, related to the acquisition and integration of The Habit Restaurants, Inc. ("Habit"). 

(c)On March 18, 2020 we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Habit for total cash consideration of $408 million, net of cash acquired. During the first-quarter of 2020 the operation of substantially all Habit restaurants was impacted by government recommendations and mandates arising from containment and mitigation measures related to the COVID-19 global pandemic. As a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Habit’s results through March 31, 2020 as well as general market conditions, during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $139 million to Other (income) expense. As we continued to refine our preliminary purchase price allocation for Habit in the quarter ended September 30, 2020 the impairment charge was adjusted upward by $5 million. These impairment charges have been reflected as Special Items. We have also reflected the tax benefit of these impairment charges, which totaled $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as Special Items.

(d)On June 24, 2020, the Yum! Brands, Inc. Board of Directors approved the establishment of the Company’s new global “Unlocking Opportunity Initiative” including a $100 million investment over the next five years to fight inequality by unlocking opportunities for employees, restaurant team members and communities. The Company recorded a Special Item charge of $50 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2020 related to a contribution made to Yum! Brands Foundation, Inc. as part of these efforts and investment.

(e)During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a Special Item charge of $25 million related to a contribution made to Yum! Brands Foundation, Inc. expected to fund past and anticipated payments for COVID relief provided to restaurant-level employees within the YUM system.

(f)During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we recorded charges of $4 million and $1 million to General and administrative expenses and Other pension (income) expense, respectively, associated with a voluntary early retirement program offered to our U.S. based employees and a worldwide severance program. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded charges of $36 million and $2 million to General and administrative expenses and Other pension (income) expense, respectively, associated with these programs. These programs were part of our efforts to optimize our resources, reallocating them toward critical areas of the business that will drive future growth. These critical areas include accelerating our digital, technology and innovation capabilities to deliver a modern, world-class team member and customer experience and improve unit economics. These charges have been reflected as Special Items.

17

(g)In May 2017, we reached an agreement with our Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees that will improve brand marketing alignment, accelerate enhancements in operations and technology and that included a permanent commitment to incremental advertising as well as digital and technology contributions by franchisees. In connection with this agreement, we recognized Special Item charges of $2 million and $8 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized Special Item charges of $5 million and $13 million, respectively. The majority of these costs were recorded within Franchise and property expenses.

(h)During the second quarter of 2019, we recorded charges of $8 million and $2 million to Other (income) expense and Interest expense, net, respectively, related to cash payments in excess of our recorded liability to settle contingent consideration associated with our acquisition of the KFC Turkey and Pizza Hut Turkey businesses in 2013. Consistent with prior adjustments to the recorded contingent consideration we have reflected this as a Special Item.

(i)During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, KFC Holding Co., Pizza Hut Holdings, LLC and Taco Bell of America, LLC, each of which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued a notice of redemption for $1,050 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Subsidiary Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2024 (the "2024 Notes"). The redemption amount included a $26 million call premium plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption of October 9, 2020. We recorded the call premium, $6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2024 Notes and $2 million of accrued and unpaid interest associated with the period of time from prepayment of the 2024 Notes with the Trustee on September 25, 2020 to their redemption date within Interest expense, net and reflected the charges as Special Items.

(j)Tax Benefit (Expense) on Special Items was determined based upon the impact of the nature, as well as the jurisdiction of the respective individual components within Special Items. Additionally, we increased our Income tax provision by $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 to record a reserve against the tax recorded on a prior year divestiture, the effects of which were previously recorded as a Special Item.

(k)In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights. As a result of the transfer of certain of these rights, largely to subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (UK), we received a step-up in tax basis to current fair value under applicable tax law. To the extent this step-up in tax basis will be amortizable against future taxable income, we recognized one-time deferred tax benefits of $3 million and $226 million as a Special Item in the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the UK Finance Act 2020 was enacted resulting in an increase in the UK corporate tax rate from 17% to 19%. As a result, in the quarter ended September 30, 2020 we remeasured the related deferred tax asset originally recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. This remeasurement resulted in the recognition of an additional $25 million deferred tax benefit as a Special Item in the quarter ended September 30, 2020.
