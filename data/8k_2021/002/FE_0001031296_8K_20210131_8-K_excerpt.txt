Item 8.01 Other Events.

As previously disclosed, FirstEnergy Corp. (“FirstEnergy”) is subject to several lawsuits following the July 2020 federal criminal proceeding involving the now former Ohio House Speaker, Larry Householder, and other individuals and entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Householder and relating to Ohio’s House Bill 6 (“HB 6 Criminal Proceedings”). Those civil lawsuits include the now consolidated lawsuits brought by the Ohio Attorney General (“OAG”), State of Ohio ex rel. Dave Yost, Ohio Attorney General v. FirstEnergy Corp., et al., and the cities of Cincinnati and Columbus (the “Cities”), City of Cincinnati and City of Columbus v. FirstEnergy Corp., et al., in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (“Consolidated Civil Cases”). On January 13, 2021, the OAG filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking, among other things, to: (i) restrain and enjoin FirstEnergy and FirstEnergy’s Ohio utilities, Ohio Edison Company, The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, and The Toledo Edison Company (collectively, the “Ohio Companies”), from collecting revenue under the decoupling riders permitted under Ohio House Bill 6; and (ii) refund to the Ohio Companies’ customers amounts previously collected under the decoupling riders. On January 31, 2021, FirstEnergy reached a settlement with the OAG and the Cities with respect to the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction request and related issues. In connection with the settlement, the Ohio Companies filed an application on February 1, 2021, with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (“PUCO”) to set their respective decoupling riders (Rider CSR) to zero. Within five business days of any PUCO order approving the application, the Ohio Companies will ensure that no additional customer bills will include new decoupling rider charges. FirstEnergy expects to set the Ohio Companies’ remaining Rider CSR regulatory asset balance of approximately $110 million to $0.

In the absence of the decoupling riders permitted under Ohio House Bill 6, the Ohio Companies believe they would have collected lost distribution revenue estimated at $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. However, there can be no assurance that the PUCO would authorize the Ohio Companies in any future proceedings to recover such lost distribution revenue. The Ohio Companies continue to evaluate their approach to regulatory filings in Ohio associated with the lost distribution revenue and other matters.

In addition, promptly after any PUCO order approving the application, the OAG, the Cities, and FirstEnergy will submit a proposed agreed order in the Consolidated Civil Cases: (i) withdrawing the OAG’s motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; (ii) staying the Consolidated Civil Cases until final resolution of all HB 6 Criminal Proceedings; and (iii) granting the Cities’ pending motion for leave to file an amended complaint adding the cities of Dayton and Toledo as parties to the Cities’ lawsuit.

Dividends declared from time to time on FirstEnergy’s common stock during any period may in the aggregate vary from prior periods due to circumstances considered by FirstEnergy’s Board of Directors at the time of the actual declarations. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements and risks that are included in our filings with the SEC, including but not limited to the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. The foregoing review of factors also should not be construed as exhaustive. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor assess the impact of any such factor on FirstEnergy’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. FirstEnergy expressly disclaims any current intention to update or revise, except as required by law, any forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
