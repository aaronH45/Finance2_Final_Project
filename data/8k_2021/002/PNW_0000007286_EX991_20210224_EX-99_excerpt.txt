Pinnacle West Reports 2020 Full-Year and Fourth-Quarter Results

•Full-year results reflect record heat, superior operational performance, continued cost management 

•Annual retail customer growth a robust 2.3%

•Cultural transformation continues with introduction of the “APS Promise”

PHOENIX – Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $550.6 million, or $4.87 per diluted share, for full-year 2020. This result compares with net income of $538.3 million, or $4.77 per diluted share, in 2019. Weather impacts alone accounted for a year-over-year increase in after-tax revenues of $94 million, or $0.83 cents per share.

“In a year that brought challenges including COVID-19, the hottest Arizona summer on record and an extended wildfire season, our dedicated employees continued to perform remarkably well for our customers while advancing our clean energy goals,” said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and CEO Jeff Guldner. “Combined with efficiency initiatives, cost management and economic growth, these efforts helped produce solid financial results in 2020.”

Operating Performance and Reliability Remain Strong

The company’s principal subsidiary, Arizona Public Service Co., experienced robust customer growth in 2020 of 2.3%, as people and businesses continued to move to Arizona, making the company’s service territory among the fastest growing in the nation. Customers’ peak electricity demand also increased about 7.7% over 2019 and surpassed the prior record set in 2017 by 4%.

APS was able to meet the increased demands of this growing customer base by maintaining superior power plant performance. Palo Verde Generating Station was the nation’s largest single source of clean power for the 25th straight year, and the company’s non-nuclear fleet had its best reliability performance since 2007.

In addition, APS finished 2020 with its best year ever for service reliability, excluding voluntary and proactive fire mitigation impacts from an exceptionally long fire season. The average APS customer experienced less than one power outage (0.76) and faced fewer total minutes of interrupted service (70 minutes) than industry averages. APS employees also achieved their best year ever for safety, excluding the effects of COVID-19.

O&M Acceleration Contributed to Lower Fourth-Quarter Results 

For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2020, Pinnacle West reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $19.4 million, or a loss of $0.17 per diluted share. This result compares with net income attributable to common shareholders of $64.0 million, or $0.57 per share, for the same period in 2019.

Main drivers for the quarter-over-quarter loss were a settlement with the Arizona Attorney General’s Office and the decision to pull forward near-term operations and maintenance expense into the year’s final quarter. The company believes accelerating some spend into 2020 will help mitigate the potential impacts of mild weather in future years, while stepping up investments that improve customers’ experience and interaction with APS.

The APS Promise: A Renewed Commitment to Customers

In a year of transition and renewed focus on excellence in customer care, the company recently launched a new cultural framework called The APS Promise. Guldner and the leadership team are championing this cultural transformation to keep employees’ talent focused on customers and ensure the company remains an employer of choice. The Promise fosters empowered decision-making, innovation and collaboration as behavioral norms across all levels of the organization.

“Moving into 2021, we remain focused on improving our customers’ experience,” stated Guldner. “The APS Promise is our commitment to our customers, community and to each other, as employees.

“In short, it is a customer-focused mindset that explains why we’re here (Our Purpose), what we’re here to do (Our Vision and Our Mission) and the principles and behaviors that will empower us to achieve our strategic goals, including continuing our ongoing cost-management efforts and increasing customer satisfaction.”

As part of the effort to provide best-in-class customer care and interactions, residential customers now have access to APS’s Customer Care Center 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition to service and billing questions, advisors are available to help customers with crisis bill assistance, payment arrangements and other energy support programs.

Customer Financial Assistance Continues Amid Pandemic

Since last March, when the COVID-19 pandemic upended Arizonans’ way of life, APS suspended customer late fees and disconnections for nonpayment. Given the challenges facing our customers and communities, we distributed more than $15 million in pandemic aid in 2020, including $8.8 million in customer support and $3.6 million to limited-income customers who had fallen behind on their bills. In addition, APS has worked to connect customers with a variety 

of utility bill support – both COVID relief and programs like crisis bill assistance that are available even without a pandemic. 

APS will continue to waive late fees for residential and business customers through Oct. 15, 2021, and will continue to provide flexible payment options and additional assistance for those who need help the most.

A full list of the company’s actions in response to the pandemic is available on the Pinnacle West website, and APS customers are encouraged to visit aps.com/save for up-to-date details on available resources and support. 

Advancing a Clean Energy Future for Arizona

Early in 2020, the company set a course toward providing customers with 100% clean, carbon-free electricity by 2050 – while maintaining reliability and affordable prices for customers.

Guldner shared that the company made steady progress in its first year and remains on track to cease the use of coal generation by 2031: “We secured more than 400 megawatts of wind and other clean energy resources and issued a request for proposal late last year to acquire more battery storage that can be combined with solar generation to add more than 1 gigawatt of new resources to the system, including more renewable energy. We also executed an agreement to add battery energy storage to six existing APS solar plants.”
