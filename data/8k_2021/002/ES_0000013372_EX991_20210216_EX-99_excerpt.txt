(HARTFORD, Conn. and BOSTON, Mass. – February 16, 2021) Eversource Energy (NYSE: ES) today reported full-year 2020 earnings of $1.205 billion, or $3.55 per share, compared with 2019 earnings of $909.1 million, or $2.81 per share. Results for 2020 include after-tax costs of $32.1 million, or $0.09 per share, related to the acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. Results for 2019 include a charge of $204.4 million, or $0.64 per share, related to the Northern Pass Transmission (NPT) project. 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, Eversource Energy earned $271.9 million, or $0.79 per share, compared with earnings of $250 million, or $0.76 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2019. Results for the fourth quarter of 2020 include after-tax costs of $19.3 million, or $0.06 per share, related to the Columbia Gas asset acquisition. 

2021 and Long-Term Earnings Per Share (EPS) Guidance 

Also today, Eversource Energy projected 2021 non-GAAP earnings of between $3.81 per share and $3.93 per share, excluding incremental Columbia Gas asset transition costs. Eversource also projects that its long-term EPS growth through 2025 from its core regulated utility segments will be in the upper half of its previously announced range of 5-7 percent, using 2020 non-GAAP earnings of $3.64 per share as the base. 

Electric Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s electric distribution segment earned $544 million for the full year 2020, compared with earnings of $513.3 million for the full year 2019. The segment earned $93.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with earnings of $90.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Improved results were due to higher revenues, partially offset by significantly higher electric system restoration costs during an unprecedented year of storm activity. 

“Tropical Storm Isaias was by far the worst storm to damage our system in 2020, but it was far from the only one,” said Jim Judge, Eversource chairman, president and chief executive officer. “We had more storm activity in 2020 than in any year in our history, right up through Christmas Day when thousands of Eversource employees responded to extremely high and damaging winds that caused extensive damage across our service territory. It was the most recent of dozens of instances in 2020 where Eversource employees worked tirelessly and safely through the pandemic to maintain and restore vital services to our 4.3 million customers.” 

Electric Transmission 

Eversource Energy’s transmission segment earned $502.5 million for the full year of 2020, compared with earnings of $460.9 million1 in 2019, excluding the NPT charge. The transmission segment earned $120.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with earnings of $118.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Higher earnings in 2020 were due primarily to an increased level of investment in Eversource Energy transmission facilities. 

Natural Gas Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s natural gas distribution segment earned $135.6 million1 for the full year 2020, excluding acquisition-related costs in the fourth quarter of $1.5 million, compared with earnings of $96.2 million for the full year 2019. Fourth quarter 2020 natural gas segment earnings were $62.3 million1, excluding acquisition-related costs, compared with earnings of $39.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Improved results primarily reflect fourth quarter 2020 earnings from assets of the former Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. Eversource closed on the purchase on October 9, 2020 and now holds them in its new Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts subsidiary. Improved results also reflect higher distribution revenues at NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense. 

Water Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s water distribution segment earned $41.2 million for the full year 2020, compared with earnings of $34.9 million for the full year 2019, and $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Higher full-year results in 2020 include the benefit from the sale of Aquarion Water facilities in Hingham, Massachusetts. 

Eversource Energy Parent and Other Companies 

Eversource Energy parent and other companies earned $14 million1 for the full year 2020, excluding acquisition-related costs of $30.6 million, compared with earnings of $8.2 million for the full year 2019. It earned $9.2 million1 in the fourth quarter of 2020, excluding acquisition-related costs of $17.8 million, compared with a loss of $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Improved fourth-quarter results were due primarily to a lower effective tax rate.

1 All per-share amounts in this news release are reported on a diluted basis. The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource Energy. The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities of such business, but rather represent a direct interest in Eversource Energy's assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a non-GAAP (not determined using generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to common shareholders of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource Energy common shares outstanding for the period. Earnings discussions also include non-GAAP financial measures referencing 2020 earnings and EPS excluding certain acquisition costs related to our purchase of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and 2019 earnings and EPS excluding the NPT impairment charge. Eversource Energy uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results by business and to more fully compare and explain 2020 and 2019 results without including these items. 

Management believes the acquisition costs and the NPT impairment charge are not indicative of Eversource Energy’s ongoing costs and performance. Due to the nature and significance of these items on net income attributable to common shareholders, management believes that the non-GAAP presentation is a more meaningful representation of Eversource Energy’s financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers in analyzing historical and future performance of the business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to Eversource Energy’s consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of Eversource Energy’s operating performance.
