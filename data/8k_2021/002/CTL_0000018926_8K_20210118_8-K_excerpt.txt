(b) Following discussions over the past several weeks regarding succession planning and potential retirement, Eric J. Mortensen, 62, Senior Vice President and Controller (and principal accounting officer) and management mutually agreed upon Mr. Mortensen’s retirement from Lumen Technologies* (the “Company”). On January 18, 2021 Mr Mortensen informed the Company of his decision to retire from the Company effective on or about May 14, 2021. Mr. Mortensen has been in a Controller role with Lumen Technologies and its predecessor companies for more than 24 years.  

(c) The Company has named Andrea Genschaw as Mr. Mortensen’s successor and plans to appoint her as Senior Vice President and Controller (and principal accounting officer) effective upon Mr. Mortensen’s retirement on or about May 14, 2021. Ms. Genschaw, 46, has served as the Company’s Vice President and Assistant Controller since 2019. Prior to that role, Ms. Genschaw was the Assistant Controller of Level 3 Communications, Inc. (“Level 3”) from 2010 through its merger with Lumen. Before joining Level 3, Ms. Genschaw had significant public company financial reporting experience, working for PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), in various capacities, from 1996 - 2002 and 2004 - 2010. From 2002 - 2004, Ms. Genschaw was selected to be a Professional Accounting Fellow with the Division of Corporation Finance at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  

In consideration of her new responsibilities and anticipated appointment, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee approved certain adjustments to Ms. Genschaw’s compensation arrangements. Effective January 10, 2021, Ms. Genschaw will earn a base salary of $315,000 per year, will be eligible to earn a target short-term incentive award of 65% of her base salary, and an annual long-term incentive (“LTI”) award.
