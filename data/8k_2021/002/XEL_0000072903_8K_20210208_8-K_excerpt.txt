Item 8.01. Other Events

On Feb. 8, 2021, Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS), a New Mexico corporation, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed an electric rate case with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) and its 81 municipalities with original rate jurisdiction seeking an increase in base rates of approximately $143 million. SPS' net rate increase to Texas customers is expected to be approximately $74 million, or 9.2%, as a result of offsetting $69 million in fuel cost savings and production tax credits (PTCs) from the Sagamore wind project. 

The request is primarily driven by additional capital investment in new and upgraded electric facilities and equipment since SPS’ previous rate case in 2019, including the 522-megawatt Sagamore wind farm.

The request is based on a return on equity of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.60% (based on actual capital structure), a Texas retail rate base of approximately $3.3 billion and a historic test year based on the 12-month period ended Dec. 31, 2020 (with the final three months based on estimates). In March 2021, SPS will file to update estimates to actuals through Dec. 31, 2020.

Additionally, the request includes the loss of 400 megawatts from a wholesale transmission customer and changes to depreciation rates to reflect a reduction to the service lives of SPS’ Tolk power plant (from 2037 to 2032) and the coal handling assets of the Harrington facility (to 2024).

Summary of SPS’ request:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SPS is requesting the PUCT set current rates as temporary on March 15, 2021. Once final rates are approved, a surcharge will be requested from March 15, 2021 through the effective date of new base rates. A PUCT decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022.
