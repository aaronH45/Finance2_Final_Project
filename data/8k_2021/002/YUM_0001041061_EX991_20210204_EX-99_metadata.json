        "(k)In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights. As a result of the transfer of certain of these rights, largely to subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (UK), we received a step-up in tax basis to current fair value under applicable tax law. To the extent this step-up in tax basis will be amortizable against future taxable income, we recognized one-time deferred tax benefits of $3 million and $226 million as a Special Item in the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the UK Finance Act 2020 was enacted resulting in an increase in the UK corporate tax rate from 17% to 19%. As a result, in the quarter ended September 30, 2020 we remeasured the related deferred tax asset originally recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. This remeasurement resulted in the recognition of an additional $25 million deferred tax benefit as a Special Item in the quarter ended September 30, 2020."
