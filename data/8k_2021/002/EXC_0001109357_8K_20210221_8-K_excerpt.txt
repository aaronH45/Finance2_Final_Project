Section 8 - Other Events

Item 8.01. Other Events

On February 24, 2021, Exelon Corporation (Exelon) announced that on February 21, 2021 its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate its utilities business, comprised of the company’s six regulated electric and gas utilities, and Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation), its competitive power generation and customer-facing energy businesses, creating two publicly traded companies with the resources necessary to best serve customers and sustain long-term investment and operating excellence. The separation gives each company the financial and strategic independence to focus on its specific customer needs, while executing its core business strategy. 

Exelon is targeting to complete the separation in the first quarter of 2022, which would be effected by a dividend distribution to Exelon’s shareholders. The separation is subject to customary conditions, including final approval by Exelon’s Board of Directors, a Form 10 registration statement being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, receipt of regulatory approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and New York Public Service Commission, receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and tax opinion from Exelon’s tax advisors, and satisfaction of other conditions. There can be no assurance that any separation transaction will ultimately occur or, if one does occur, of its terms or timing.

A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
