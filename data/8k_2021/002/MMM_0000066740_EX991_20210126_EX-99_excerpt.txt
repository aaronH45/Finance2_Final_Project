“The 3M team delivered a strong fourth quarter with organic growth across all business groups, robust cash flow and a double-digit increase in earnings per share,” said Mike Roman, 3M chairman and chief executive officer. “In an uncertain economic environment, we stayed focused on innovating for our customers, improving our operational execution and fighting the pandemic from every angle.” 

“Throughout 2020 we distributed two billion respirators globally, and supported the development and manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics to help the world respond to COVID-19,” Roman continued. “We also took significant actions to transform and build 3M for the future, while advancing our core values. Moving forward we will continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability as we build on our progress and deliver strong results in 2021.”

2020 Overview: Helping the world recover, building a better company, and positioning for growth 

When the world needed 3M in 2020, we were there: fighting the pandemic from all angles, making and delivering more personal protective equipment than ever before, helping speed development of vaccines and therapeutics, and providing our expertise to governments around the world to manage pandemic response. 

In addition, 3M forged partnerships with the U.S., Canada, Germany, and Singapore governments to create additional respirator manufacturing capacity. 3M applied its expertise to ensure business continuity and maintain strong customer service as market demand and government mandates rapidly shifted the flow of global supplies. 

While stepping up its efforts to support pandemic care and recovery, 3M continued to deliver for customers: providing innovative solutions across our industry-leading businesses to improve health care, transportation and electronics, safety and industrial, and consumer products. At the same time, the company enhanced its financial flexibility with strong cash flow generation, aggressive cost reductions, and adjusted capital allocation plans. 

The company’s investments focused on building a better 3M that will be more efficient, effective, and connected to customers. As end markets have changed, 3M is well positioned take advantage of attractive global trends in personal safety, home improvement, e-commerce, automotive, and healthcare. 

Stepping up our leadership in ESG 

3M is expanding its commitments to improving the communities that it operates in and serves. In 2021, as part of the company’s ongoing environmental stewardship, and as part of its 2021 capital expenditure plan, 3M expects to invest $100 million to further reduce water usage and improve water quality around its manufacturing locations. 

Last year also marked a step forward for 3M’s efforts to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion – the company introduced platforms for change to address racial opportunity gaps, empowering an inclusive culture, and supporting our communities with a plan to invest $50 million to advance workforce development and STEM education initiatives. In February, the company plans to publish its first Diversity, Equity and Inclusion report and outline its commitment to improving representation of minorities at the company.

 (a)In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of special items. Special items for the periods presented include the items described in the section entitled “Description of Special Items”. Beginning in 2020, the Company includes gain/loss on sale of businesses and divestiture-related restructuring actions as special items due to their potential distortion of underlying operating results. Information provided herein reflects the impact of this change for all periods presented. Operating income, income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and a measure adjusted for special items. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company’s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for these items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

 (b)Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they function as useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. 

 (c)Adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for special items, less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Cash payments associated with special items in the determination of adjusted free cash flow are reflected net of applicable tax using the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate during the period of payment. It should not be inferred that the entire adjusted free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines adjusted free cash flow conversion as adjusted free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M, adjusted for special items. Special items for the periods presented include the items described in section entitled “Description of Special Items”. The Company believes adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.

 (d)Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation.

 (e)Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to 3M, adjusted for net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest, (income)/loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries, provision for income taxes, other expense/(income), depreciation and amortization expense, and special items. For business segments, the Company defines adjusted EBITDA as business segment operating income (3M’s measure of segment operating performance) adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Special items for the periods presented include the items described in the section entitled “Description of Special Items”. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company’s operations. The Company believes adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are meaningful to investors as they provide useful analyses of ongoing underlying operating trends. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (f)Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy.

NON-GAAP MEASURES – (CONTINUED) 

(Unaudited) 

Description of Special Items: 

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides various non-GAAP measures that incorporate adjustments for the impacts of special items. Special items incorporated in the preparation of these non-GAAP measures for the periods presented include the items described below: 

Significant litigation-related charges/benefits: 

 ·In the first quarter of 2020, 3M recorded a net pre-tax charge of $17 million ($13 million after tax) related to PFAS (certain perfluorinated compounds) matters. The charge was more than offset by a reduction in tax expense of $52 million related to resolution of tax treatment with authorities regarding the previously disclosed 2018 agreement reached with the State of Minnesota that resolved the Natural Resources Damages lawsuit. These items, in aggregate, resulted in a $39 million after-tax benefit. In the fourth quarter and full year 2020, 3M made payments of approximately $6 million and $100 million, respectively, related to significant litigation-related matters.  

 ·In 2019, the Company recorded significant litigation-related charges of $762 million ($590 million after tax) related to PFAS (certain perfluorinated compounds) matters and coal mine dust respirator mask lawsuits of which $214 million ($166 million after tax) occurred in the fourth quarter. The aggregate 2019 pre-tax charge was reflected in cost of sales ($328 million) and selling, general and administrative expense ($434 million). In the fourth quarter and full year 2019, 3M made payments of approximately $9 million and $338 million, respectively, related to significant litigation-related matters.  

Gain/loss on sale of businesses: 

 ·In the first quarter of 2020, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2 million ($1 million loss after tax) related to the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business and recognition of certain contingent consideration. In the second quarter of 2020, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $387 million ($304 million after tax) related to the sale of its drug delivery business. 

 ·In the first quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a gain related to the sale of certain oral care technology comprising a business in addition to reflecting an earnout on a previous divestiture, which together resulted in a net gain of $8 million ($7 million after tax). In the second quarter of 2019, as a result of a “held for sale” tax benefit related to the legal entities associated with the pending divestiture of the Company’s gas and flame detection business, 3M recorded an after-tax gain of $43 million. In the third quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a gain related to the divestiture of the Company’s gas and flame detection business and an immaterial impact as a result of measuring a disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, which in aggregate resulted in a pre-tax gain of $106 million ($79 million after tax).  

Divestiture-related restructuring actions: 

 ·In the second quarter 2020, following the divestiture of substantially all of the drug delivery business, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions addressing corporate functional costs and manufacturing footprint across 3M in relation to the magnitude of amounts previously allocated/burdened to the divested business. As a result, 3M recorded a second quarter 2020 pre-tax charge of $55 million ($46 million after tax) and made subsequent immaterial adjustments thereto. In the fourth quarter and full year 2020, 3M made payments of approximately $7 million and $14 million, respectively, associated with these restructuring charges. 

 ·In the fourth quarter and full year of 2019, 3M made payments of approximately $8 million and $76 million, respectively, associated with restructuring charges taken in 2018 related to addressing corporate functional costs following the 2018 Communication Markets Division divestiture.  

Loss on deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiary: 

 ·In the second quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $162 million related to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary. 

Enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) 

 ·In the full year 2020, 3M made payments of approximately $33 million related to the transition tax expense incurred as a result of the 2017 enactment of the TCJA.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

Effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) has been updated for all periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company’s business segments. In the fourth quarter of 2020, information relative to business segment depreciation reviewed by 3M’s CODM also changed. The change did not impact each segment’s operating income, but did change the separate summarization of depreciation by segment in CODM information. Business segment depreciation is based on the underlying usage of assets (while the particular asset itself may be entirely reflected within a different business segment’s asset balance as its primary user). This depreciation also includes allocated depreciation associated with a number of assets reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. Depreciation previously was summarized in CODM information based generally on depreciation of a particular asset being associated entirely with a single reporting unit, as opposed to an estimate of underlying asset usage. 

3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in “Elimination of Dual Credit”). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in “Corporate and Unallocated”). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring actions. 

In addition, effective in the first quarter of 2020, in a continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around customers and markets, the Company made the following changes: 

Continued alignment of customer account activity 

 ·As part of 3M’s regular customer-focus initiatives, the Company realigned certain customer account activity (“sales district”) to correlate with the primary divisional product offerings in various countries and reduce complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. This largely impacted the amount of dual credit certain business segments receive as a result of sales district attribution. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. 

Additional actions impacting product line alignments 

 ·The remaining retail auto care product lines formerly in the Automotive Aftermarket Division (within the Safety and Industrial business segment) were realigned to the Construction and Home Improvement Division (within the Consumer business segment). 

 ·In addition, certain product lines were realigned within business segments. The transdermal drug delivery components business, formerly included in the Drug Delivery Systems Division was realigned to the Medical Solutions Division (both of which are within the Health Care business segment) and the paint protection film business, formerly included in the Automotive and Aerospace Division was realigned to the Commercial Solutions Division (both of which are within the Transportation and Electronics business segment). 

The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.
