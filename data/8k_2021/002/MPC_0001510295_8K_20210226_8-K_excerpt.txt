Item 2.02Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On February 2, 2021, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC” or the “Company”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2020. Subsequent to the release of preliminary earnings, and in conjunction with the preparation of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “Form 10-K”), the Company reduced its estimate of state deferred income tax liabilities to reflect the appropriate state tax filing status for certain of its wholly owned entities. As a result, the Company recorded an incremental deferred benefit for income taxes on continuing operations of $93 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refer to the below table for a summary of the revisions to the results to be reported in the Form 10-K.

These revisions had no effect on segment operating results, income from discontinued operations, cash flows or adjusted earnings as previously reported by the Company.

A revised earnings release, earnings call presentation and Investor Relations Packet reflecting these revisions will be published on the Investors page of the MPC website at https://www.marathonpetroleum.com.
