Section 8 - Other Events

Item 8.01. Other Events

Beginning on February 15, 2021, Texas-based generating assets of Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Generation) within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, specifically Colorado Bend II, Wolf Hollow II, and Handley, experienced outages as a result of historically severe cold weather conditions. In addition, those weather conditions drove increased demand for service, limited the availability of natural gas to fuel power plants, and dramatically increased wholesale power prices. In response to the high demand and significantly reduced total generation on the system, ERCOT implemented load reductions to maintain the reliability of the grid and required the use of an administrative price cap of $9,000 per megawatt hour during load shedding events. 

As of February 18, 2021, we have put generating units back online at ERCOT. ERCOT has indicated that mandated load curtailments may continue to be needed. Generation remains in close contact with ERCOT about the condition and status of its generating units located in ERCOT. 

The full impact to financial statements arising from these market and weather conditions is unknown and cannot be estimated at this time in part due to the timing of settlement data.
