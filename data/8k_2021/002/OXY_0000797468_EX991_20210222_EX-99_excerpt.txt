HOUSTON — February 22, 2021 — Occidental (NYSE:OXY) today announced a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $1.3 billion, or $1.41 per diluted share, and an adjusted loss attributable to common stockholders of $731 million, or $0.78 per diluted share. Fourth quarter after-tax items affecting comparability of $581 million included a loss of $820 million related to the sale of non-core assets in the Permian Basin.

“We remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and transitioned into 2021 with an improved financial position by achieving our 2020 divestiture target, reducing debt and successfully extending debt maturities,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub. “In the fourth quarter, our businesses again outperformed as our teams continue to leverage our technical expertise to mitigate production decline while relentlessly lowering costs.”

QUARTERLY RESULTS

Oil and Gas

Oil and gas pre-tax loss on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter results included a pre-tax loss of $820 million related to the sale of non-core assets in the Permian Basin. Excluding items affecting comparability, fourth quarter oil and gas results improved over the third quarter due to higher commodity prices. For the fourth quarter of 2020, average WTI and Brent marker prices were $42.66 per barrel and $45.24 per barrel, respectively. Average worldwide realized crude oil prices increased by approximately 5 percent from the prior quarter to $40.77 per barrel. Average worldwide realized NGL prices increased by approximately 1 percent from the prior quarter to $14.95 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). Average domestic realized gas prices increased by approximately 31 percent from the prior quarter to $1.55 per Mcf.

Excluding Colombia, which was sold in December, total average daily production for the fourth quarter was 1,143 thousand of barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed), which exceeded the midpoint of guidance by 13 Mboed. Permian Resources exceeded the high end of guidance with production of 382 Mboed and all other domestic operations came in near the high end of guidance with production of 518 Mboed. International average daily production volumes were 243 Mboed.

OxyChem

Chemical pre-tax income of $192 million for the fourth quarter exceeded guidance. Compared to prior quarter income of $178 million, the improvement in fourth quarter income resulted primarily from higher vinyl margins, partially offset by lower realized caustic soda prices.

Midstream and Marketing

Midstream and marketing pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter was $90 million, compared to a loss of $2.8 billion for the third quarter of 2020. Excluding items affecting comparability, midstream and marketing pre-tax fourth quarter results reflected higher non-cash mark-to-market losses in the marketing business. Excluding WES equity income, midstream and marketing pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter was $234 million.

(a) Non-GAAP Measure Adjusted income is a non-GAAP measure. Occidental defines adjusted income as net income excluding the effects of significant transactions and events that affect earnings but vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. These events may recur, even across successive reporting periods. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management’s performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental’s earnings performance between periods. Reported net income is considered representative of management’s performance over the long term, and adjusted income is not considered to be an alternative to net income reported in accordance with GAAP.

The difference between reported average diluted shares outstanding and adjusted average diluted shares outstanding is immaterial and does not impact the calculation of adjusted earnings per share. As such, adjusted earnings per share is calculated as adjusted income (loss) divided by reported average diluted shares outstanding.
