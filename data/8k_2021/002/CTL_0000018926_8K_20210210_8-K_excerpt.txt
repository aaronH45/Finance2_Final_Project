Item 2.02.Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On February 10, 2021, Lumen Technologies, Inc. (the “Company” or “we” or “us”) issued a press release announcing operating results for the fourth quarter of 2020. A copy of the Earnings Release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated into this report by reference. More complete information about our operating results will be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which we expect to file in the near term with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 7.01.Regulation FD Disclosure

 As noted in the Earnings Release, commencing in the first quarter of 2021 the Company plans to make certain changes to its financial reporting methodologies. 

The Company will be making changes to its segment and customer-facing sales channel reporting in 2021 to reflect organizational changes made by the Company to better support its customers. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, the Company will prospectively report two segments: Business and Mass Markets. The Business segment will include four sales channels: International & Global Accounts, Large Enterprise, Mid-Market Enterprise, and Wholesale. The Mass Markets segment will include both Consumer and our Small Business Group ("SBG") sales channels. 

 Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2021, the Company plans to prospectively change its product category reporting to better reflect product life cycles and the Company's go to market approach. These changes include both the creation of new product categories and the realignment of products and services within previously reported product categories.

To enable investors to more readily compare the information to be presented under the new financial reporting methodologies with prior periods, the Company has furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2 unaudited supplemental financial information that recasts its historical operating revenue to reflect the above-described changes to segment reporting for each of the four quarters comprising the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
