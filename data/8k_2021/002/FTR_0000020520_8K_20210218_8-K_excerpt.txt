 Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers    

On February 16, 2021, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Frontier Communications Corporation (the “Company”) appointed Nick Jeffery to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective as of March 4, 2021, following a brief transition period commencing February 22, 2021. Mr. Jeffery will be appointed as a member of the Board upon the Company’s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The terms of Mr. Jeffery’s employment agreement and related matters are set forth in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 15, 2020. 

Mr. Jeffery will succeed Bernard L. Han, who will step down as President and Chief Executive Officer on March 4, 2021. On February 18, 2021, the Company entered into a Transition Agreement with Mr. Han pursuant to which Mr. Han (a) will step down as President and Chief Executive Officer on the date on which Nick Jeffrey commences employment as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, (b) will continue to provide transition services as a Senior Advisor and serve as a member of our Board of Directors through the date of the Company’s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and (c) will generally receive separation payments and benefits consistent with those payable upon a qualifying termination of employment under the Employment Agreement, dated December 3, 2019, by and between the Company and Mr. Han (which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 3, 2019), except that Mr. Han’s pro rata incentive compensation payment for the year of separation will be determined based on target performance. In addition, upon his separation from service, Mr. Han will also be entitled to a lump sum cash payment representing the deferred portion of his performance-based incentive plan awards for 2020. 

The foregoing description of the Transition Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Transition Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.

On February 18, 2021, the Company filed a notice with the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the entry into and execution of an executive chairman agreement with John Stratton, which provides that Mr. Stratton will become executive chairman of the Reorganized Debtors, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
