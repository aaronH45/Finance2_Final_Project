[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Certain financial information for 2020 and 2019 is presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Some numbers in this press release may not add due to rounding. Reported results were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), include all revenue and expenses recognized during the periods, and reflect Elanco Animal Health (Elanco) as discontinued operations during the first quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments for the items described in the reconciliation tables later in the release, and assume that the disposition of Elanco occurred at the beginning of 2019 (including the benefit from the reduction in shares of common stock outstanding). The company’s 2021 financial guidance is being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures are presented to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company’s business.

"Lilly closed a complex year by delivering impressive results in the fourth quarter of 2020. We finished the year with strong momentum in our core business areas, as volume-based revenue growth for our newest medicines and initial sales of our COVID-19 antibody therapy, coupled with our ongoing productivity agenda, drove robust margin expansion and solid earnings growth," said David A. Ricks, Lilly’s chairman and CEO. "I am also encouraged by exciting recent data readouts for three of our 

 2

most important pipeline assets: tirzepatide, LOXO-305 and donanemab. Each of these potential medicines has a chance to significantly improve patient outcomes in areas of high unmet medical need, and, should they go on to receive approvals, reinforce our growth prospects for the decade ahead."

Key Events Over the Last Three Months

COVID-19

•The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with a positive COVID-19 test, who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. The U.S. government has committed to purchase a total of 1,450,000 doses of bamlanivimab, which includes 950,000 doses already delivered and an agreement earlier this week to deliver 500,000 additional doses no later than March 31, 2021.

•The FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for baricitinib to be used in combination with remdesivir in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients two years of age or older with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

•Lilly and UnitedHealth Group announced a partnership to conduct a pragmatic study of bamlanivimab in high-risk, COVID-19 infected individuals. The study will identify and treat a large, diverse population of high-risk individuals for COVID-19 with bamlanivimab under real-world conditions with a goal of reducing the severity of illness and hospitalizations.

•The company announced results from a Phase 3 clinical trial that showed that bamlanivimab significantly reduced the risk of contracting symptomatic COVID-19 among residents and staff of long-term care facilities. The trial was conducted in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, and the COVID-19 Prevention Network.

•The company announced results from a Phase 3 clinical trial that showed that bamlanivimab 2800 mg and etesevimab 2800 mg together significantly reduced COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19 by 70 percent, meeting the primary endpoint of the trial. Additionally, initial results from a separate ongoing Phase 2 trial demonstrated lower doses, including bamlanivimab 700 mg and etesevimab 1400 mg together, are similar to bamlanivimab 2800 mg and etesevimab 2800 mg

together. 

•The company announced a collaboration with Vir Biotechnology, Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline plc to evaluate a combination of two COVID-19 therapies, bamlanivimab 700mg and VIR-7831 500mg, in low-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. 

Regulatory

•The FDA accepted a supplemental New Drug Application for Jardiance® which is being investigated as a potential new treatment to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure and to slow kidney function decline in adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including those with and without type 2 diabetes.

Clinical

•The company announced results from a Phase 2 study for donanemab, an investigational antibody that targets a modified form of beta amyloid called N3pG, that showed significant slowing of decline in a composite measure of cognition and daily function in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Donanemab met the primary endpoint of change from baseline to 76 weeks in the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale, slowing decline by 32 percent relative to placebo, which was statistically significant. 

•The company announced topline results from a Phase 3 monotherapy study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared to placebo. Tirzepatide led to superior A1C and body weight reductions from baseline in adults with type 2 diabetes after 40 weeks of treatment. Tirzepatide is a novel, investigational, once-weekly, dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single molecule, representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 

•The company presented updated data from the LOXO-305 global Phase 1/2 clinical trial in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, as well as in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), at the 2020 American

Fourth-Quarter Reported Results

In the fourth quarter of 2020, worldwide revenue was $7.440 billion, an increase of 22 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by a 24 percent increase in volume and a 1 percent increase due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a 4 percent decrease due to lower realized prices. The company recognized worldwide revenue of $871.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 for bamlanivimab, its COVID-19 antibody therapy. Excluding bamlanivimab revenue, worldwide revenue grew by 7 percent. Key growth products launched since 2014, consisting of Trulicity®, Verzenio®, Taltz®, Tyvyt®, Olumiant®, Jardiance, Emgality®, Cyramza®, RetevmoTM, BaqsimiTM and Basaglar® contributed nearly 12 percentage points of revenue growth and represented approximately 48 percent of total revenue for the quarter, or 55 percent of total revenue excluding bamlanivimab.

Revenue in the U.S. increased 31 percent, to $4.598 billion, driven by a 36 percent increase in volume, partially offset by a 5 percent decrease due to lower realized prices. The company recognized U.S. revenue of $850.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 for bamlanivimab. Excluding bamlanivimab revenue, revenue in the U.S. grew by 7 percent. Increased U.S. volume for key growth products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, Emgality, Retevmo, Cyramza, Olumiant, Jardiance and Baqsimi, was partially offset by lower volume for certain other products, including Forteo® and Tradjenta®. Inventory stocking in the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately $120 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to lower than typical year-end stocking in 2019. The decrease in realized prices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by increased rebates to gain and maintain broad commercial access across the portfolio, partially offset by modest list price increases, largely for diabetes, and, to a lesser extent, by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, most notably for Taltz. Segment mix was not a major driver of U.S. price performance in the fourth quarter 

 7

of 2020, as increased utilization in more highly-rebated government segments was offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment, primarily for Trulicity and Humalog. 

Revenue outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, to $2.842 billion, driven by a 9 percent increase in volume and a 3 percent increase due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a 2 percent decrease due to lower realized prices. The increase in volume outside the U.S. was driven primarily by increased volume for key growth products, including Tyvyt, Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz, Verzenio, Jardiance, Cyramza, Basaglar, Emgality and Baqsimi, as well as volume gains for Alimta®, partially offset by decreased volume for Cialis®, Forteo and Trajenta. In addition, revenue outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from a milestone from Bayer Consumer Care AG resulting from its exclusive development and commercialization license for Vitrakvi®. The decrease in realized prices outside the U.S. was driven primarily by the inclusion of Tyvyt in the government reimbursement programs in China. 

Gross margin increased 18 percent, to $5.720 billion, in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 76.9 percent, a decrease of 2.1 percentage points compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to unfavorable product mix driven by bamlanivimab sales, higher amortization of intangibles expense related to Retevmo, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, and the impact of lower realized prices on revenue, partially offset by greater manufacturing efficiencies.

Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020, defined as the sum of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, increased 3 percent to $3.392 billion compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Research and development expenses increased 16 percent to $1.838 billion, or 24.7 percent of revenue, driven primarily by approximately $265 million of development expenses for COVID-19 antibody therapies and baricitinib. Excluding these COVID-19 expenses, research and development expenses remained flat. Marketing, selling, and administrative 

 8

expenses decreased 8 percent to $1.554 billion, primarily due to lower marketing expenses, reflecting reduced promotional activity.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development charges of $366.3 million related to the previously-announced business development transactions with Innovent Biologics, Inc., Disarm Therapeutics, Inc., and Fochon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. There were no acquired in-process research and development charges in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the company recognized income for asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $30.1 million, reflecting adjustments to prior period estimates for asset impairment and severance costs. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $151.7 million. These charges were primarily related to the decision to close and sell a research and development facility located in the United Kingdom, as well as severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken to reduce the company's cost structure.

Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.992 billion, compared to $1.400 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher gross margin, lower asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges, and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by higher acquired in-process research and development charges and higher research and development expenses. Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of revenue, was 26.8 percent.

Other income was $477.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with other income of $262.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in other income was driven primarily by higher net gains on investment securities.

 9

The effective tax rate was 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared with 10.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. The effective tax rates for both periods were impacted by net discrete tax items. 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, net income and earnings per share were $2.117 billion and $2.32, respectively, compared with net income of $1.496 billion and earnings per share of $1.64 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in net income and earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by higher operating income and higher other income, partially offset by higher income tax expense.

Fourth-Quarter Non-GAAP Measures

On a non-GAAP basis, fourth-quarter 2020 gross margin increased 20 percent, to $5.848 billion compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78.6 percent, a decrease of 1.3 percentage points. The decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to unfavorable product mix driven by bamlanivimab sales, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, and the impact of lower realized prices on revenue, partially offset by greater manufacturing efficiencies.

Operating income on a non-GAAP basis increased $850.5 million, or 53 percent, to $2.456 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, due primarily to higher gross margin and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by higher research and development expenses. Operating margin was 33.0 percent on a non-GAAP basis.

The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 14.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared with 12.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. The effective tax rates for both periods were impacted by net discrete tax items. 

 10

On a non-GAAP basis, in the fourth quarter of 2020 net income increased 58 percent, to $2.509 billion, while earnings per share increased 59 percent, to $2.75, compared with $1.583 billion and $1.73, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in net income and earnings per share was driven primarily by higher operating income and higher other income, partially offset by higher income tax expense.

Full Year Reported Results

For the full year 2020, worldwide revenue increased 10 percent to $24.540 billion, compared with $22.319 billion in the same period in 2019. The increase in revenue was driven by a 15 percent increase in volume, partially offset by a 5 percent decrease due to lower realized prices. Excluding bamlanivimab revenue, worldwide revenue grew by 6 percent.

Revenue in the U.S. in 2020 increased 12 percent to $14.229 billion, driven by increased volume for key growth products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Emgality, Verzenio, Jardiance, Cyramza, Baqsimi, 

 11

Retevmo, Olumiant and Basaglar, as well as the inclusion of revenue for bamlanivimab. Excluding bamlanivimab revenue, U.S. revenue grew 5 percent. The increase in revenue due to volume was partially offset by a decrease in realized prices, as well as lower revenue for Cialis, Tradjenta and Forteo. The decrease in realized prices in the U.S. was primarily driven by increased rebates to gain and maintain broad commercial access across the portfolio and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable segment mix and changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, most notably impacting Humalog. The decrease in realized prices in the U.S. was partially offset by modest list price increases and lower utilization in the 340B segment.

Revenue outside the U.S. in 2020 increased 7 percent to $10.310 billion, due to increased volume for key growth products, including Tyvyt, Trulicity, Olumiant, Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance, Cyramza, Basaglar, Emgality and Baqsimi, partially offset by decreased volume for Forteo and Trajenta. Volume growth outside the U.S. for Tyvyt and Alimta benefited from inclusion in government reimbursement programs in China. Volume growth outside the U.S. was partially offset by a 6 percent decrease due to lower realized prices, driven primarily by the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government reimbursement programs in China.

Gross margin increased 8 percent to $19.057 billion in 2020. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 77.7%, a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared with 2019. The decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to the impact of lower realized prices on revenue, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, and higher amortization of intangibles expense related to Retevmo, partially offset by prior year charges resulting from the suspension of promotion of Lartruvo and greater manufacturing efficiencies. Gross margin percent for 2020 was also negatively impacted as a result of bamlanivimab sales in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Total operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, increased 3 percent to $12.207 billion in 2020. Research and development expenses increased 9 percent to $6.086 billion, or 25 percent of revenue, driven primarily by 

 12

approximately $450 million of development expenses for COVID-19 antibody therapies and baricitinib. Excluding these COVID-19 expenses, research and development expenses were relatively flat. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent to $6.121 billion, primarily due to lower marketing activity. 

In 2020, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development charges of $660.4 million resulting from the acquisition of a pre-clinical stage company as well as the previously announced business development transactions with Innovent Biologics, Inc., Disarm Therapeutics Inc., Sitryx Therapeutics Limited, Fochon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., AbCellera Biologics Inc., Evox Therapeutics Ltd, and Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co. Ltd. In 2019, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development charges of $239.6 million resulting from business development transactions with AC Immune SA, Centrexion Therapeutics Corporation, ImmuNext, Inc., and Avidity Biosciences, Inc.

In 2020, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $131.2 million. The charges were primarily related to severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken worldwide to reduce our cost structure, as well as acquisition and integration costs incurred as part of the acquisition of Dermira, Inc. In 2019, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $575.6 million. The charges were primarily associated with the accelerated vesting of Loxo Oncology employee equity awards as part of the acquisition of Loxo Oncology. 

Operating income in 2020 increased 22 percent compared with 2019 to $6.058 billion, driven primarily by higher gross margin, lower asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges, and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by higher research and development expenses and higher acquired in-process research and development charges. Operating margin in 2020 was 24.7 percent.

Other income was $1.172 billion in 2020 compared with $291.6 million in 2019. The increase in other income was driven primarily by higher net gains on investment securities.

 13

For the full year 2020, the effective tax rate was 14.3 percent, compared with an effective tax rate of 11.9 percent for the full year 2019, driven by net discrete tax benefits in 2019. 

For the full year 2020, net income and earnings per share were $6.194 billion and $6.79, respectively, compared with $8.318 billion and $8.89, respectively, in 2019. The decrease in net income and earnings per share during 2020 were driven primarily by the approximate $3.7 billion gain recognized on the disposition of Elanco in 2019, partially offset by higher operating income and higher other income in 2020. 

Full Year Non-GAAP Measures

On a non-GAAP basis for the full year 2020, gross margin increased 9 percent, to $19.472 billion compared with the full year 2019. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the full year 2020 was 79.3 percent, compared to 80.1 percent for the full year 2019. The decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to the impact of lower realized prices on revenue and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, partially offset by greater manufacturing efficiencies. Gross margin percent for 2020 was also negatively impacted as a result of bamlanivimab sales in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Operating income on a non-GAAP basis increased $1.186 billion, or 20 percent, to $7.265 billion driven by higher gross margin and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by higher research and development expenses. Operating margin was 29.6 percent, which was negatively affected by approximately 60 basis points due to the unfavorable financial impact of COVID-19 therapies.

Other income on a non-GAAP basis was $1.172 billion for the full year 2020, compared with $234.3 million for the full year 2019. The increase in other income was driven primarily by higher net gains on investment securities.

 14

The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 14.2 percent for the full year 2020, compared with 11.8 percent for the full year 2019, driven by net discrete tax benefits in 2019. 

On a non-GAAP basis, net income increased 30 percent and earnings per share increased 31 percent to $7.236 billion, and $7.93, respectively. The increase in net income and earnings per share was primarily driven by higher operating income and higher other income, partially offset by higher income tax expense.

Change in Non-GAAP Measures Beginning in 2021

Beginning in 2021, the company will exclude the gains and losses on investments in equity securities

from its non-GAAP measures for other income (expense) and earnings per share. Reflecting this

change in the company’s full year 2020 financial results as detailed above would have lowered the company’s full year 2020 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis by $1.15.

2021 Financial Guidance 

The company has updated certain elements of its 2021 financial guidance on a reported basis. Earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.75 on a reported basis and are still expected to be in the range of $7.75 to $8.40 on a non-GAAP basis. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The company still anticipates 2021 revenue between $26.5 billion and $28.0 billion, including an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion of revenue from COVID-19 therapies. Revenue growth is additionally expected to be driven by volume from key growth products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, Jardiance, Olumiant, Cyramza, Emgality, Tyvyt and Retevmo, as well as by COVID-19 

 24

therapies. Revenue growth is expected to be partially offset by lower revenue for products that have lost patent exclusivity. The company expects mid-single digit net price declines globally in 2021. In the U.S., the company expects low-to-mid-single digit net price declines, driven primarily by increased rebates to maintain broad commercial access and segment mix, partially offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment. Outside the U.S., the company expects net price declines in China, Japan, and Europe. 

Gross margin as a percent of revenue for 2021 is still expected to be approximately 77 percent on a reported basis and approximately 79 percent on a non-GAAP basis. 

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses for 2021 are still expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion. Research and development expenses for 2021 are still expected to be in the range of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion, including approximately $300 million to $400 million of continued investment in COVID-19 therapies. 

Operating margin for 2021 is still expected to be approximately 30 percent on a reported basis and approximately 32 percent on a non-GAAP basis.

Other income (expense) for 2021 is still expected to be expense in the range of $200 to $300 million on both a reported basis and on a non-GAAP basis. 

The 2021 effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 15 percent on both a reported basis and a non-GAAP basis.

The following table summarizes the company’s 2021 financial guidance:

Numbers may not add due to rounding.

The table above reflects only line items with non-GAAP adjustments. 

(a)The company uses non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial statements reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company’s non-GAAP measures adjust reported results to exclude amortization of intangibles and other items that are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on the company’s reported operations for a period. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate the company’s ongoing operations. They can also assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
