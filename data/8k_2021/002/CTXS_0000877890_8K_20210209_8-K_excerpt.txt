 Item 1.01.  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On February 9, 2021, Citrix Systems, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Underwriting Agreement provides for the issuance and sale by the Company of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.250% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) at a public offering price equal to 99.786% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The offering is expected to close on or about February 18, 2021, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.  

The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $740.6 million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the aggregate cash consideration payable in connection with its previously announced acquisition of Wrangler Topco, LLC, the parent entity of Wrike, Inc., and to pay related fees and expenses.  

The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. These representations, warranties and covenants are not representations of factual information to investors about the Company or its subsidiaries, and the sale of any Notes pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement is not a representation that there has not been any change in the condition of the Company. The foregoing description of the terms of the Underwriting Agreement is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the complete terms and conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.  

The Notes have been offered pursuant to a prospectus supplement, dated February 9, 2021, to the prospectus, dated October 30, 2020, that form part of the Company’s effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-249751) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
