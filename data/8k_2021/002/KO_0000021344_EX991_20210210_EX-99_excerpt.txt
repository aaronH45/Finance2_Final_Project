Company Provides 2021 Financial Outlook

ATLANTA, Feb. 10, 2020 – The Coca-Cola Company today reported fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, including sequential improvement in volume trends. The company also provided an update on its strategic transformation initiatives. Together with its bottling partners, the company continues to focus on moving swiftly to execute against system priorities and to win in the marketplace.

"In 2020, employees from across The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling system worked tirelessly to learn and adapt amidst a global crisis," said James Quincey, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. "The progress we made in 2020, including the actions taken to accelerate the transformation of our company, gives us confidence in returning to growth in the year ahead. While near-term uncertainty remains, we are well-positioned to emerge stronger from the crisis, driven by our purpose and our beverages for life ambition."

Highlights

Quarterly / Full Year Performance

•Revenues: For the quarter, net revenues declined 5% to $8.6 billion and organic revenues (non-GAAP) declined 3%. This was driven by a 3% decline in price/mix while concentrate sales were even. The quarter included two additional days, which resulted in an approximate 2-point benefit to revenue growth. The company continued to see improvement in trends compared to prior quarters. For the year, net revenues declined 11% to $33.0 billion and organic revenues (non-GAAP) declined 9%. This was driven by a 7% decline in concentrate sales and a 2% decline in price/mix. 

•Margin: For the quarter, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 27.2% versus 23.9% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 27.3% versus 24.8% in the prior year. For the full 

1

year, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 27.3% versus 27.1% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 29.6% versus 27.9% in the prior year. For both the quarter and the full year, operating margin expansion was primarily driven by effective cost management, partially offset by top-line pressure and currency headwinds.

•Earnings per share: For the quarter, EPS declined 29% to $0.34, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 6% to $0.47. For the full year, EPS declined 13% to $1.79, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) declined 8% to $1.95. Fourth quarter and full year comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of 9-point and 6-point currency headwinds, respectively.

•Market share: For the quarter, the company's value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages was even, while for the full year, the company lost NARTD value share. For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained underlying share in both at-home and away-from-home channels, which was offset by negative channel mix due to continued pressure in away-from-home channels, where the company has a strong share position. 

•Cash flow: Cash from operations was $9.8 billion for the year, down 6%, largely driven by pressure on the business due to the coronavirus pandemic and a currency headwind. Full year free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $8.7 billion, up 3%, primarily driven by lower capital expenditures versus the prior year.

Business Environment and Strategic Actions Update

Global unit case volume trends remain closely linked to consumer mobility and the health of away-from-home channels. While volume trends have broadly remained resilient amidst the continuing uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, the company experienced incremental pressure in December and into the early part of this year due to a resurgence of the coronavirus in many parts of the world. Through early February 2021, the company has experienced a volume decline of mid single digits globally, with continued elevated levels of sales in at-home channels being more than offset by pressure in away-from-home channels.

The company has made progress on its strategic transformation through the pandemic, including rewiring to become a more networked organization. The company is confident in its ability to gain share and consumers, maintain strong system economics, strengthen its reputation with key stakeholders and position the organization to win. The organization is on a path to emerge stronger and is positioned for long-term success. 

While there are still uncertainties related to the pandemic, the company has greater visibility into its future recovery and is confident that its actions will continue to mitigate the effects of the crisis. As a result, the company has reinstated guidance and is providing its 2021 outlook.

Company Updates

•Update on ongoing tax litigation with the IRS: In November 2020, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in the company's 2015 litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) involving transfer pricing tax adjustments. The court predominantly sided with the IRS. The company believes that it will ultimately prevail in the litigation based on the technical and legal merits of the company's position, its consultation with outside advisors, and the company's belief that the IRS' retroactive imposition of tax liability is unconstitutional. Accordingly, the company is not recording a provision for the full amount of the potential liability. However, in consideration of the tax consequences resulting from the application of alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied by the courts in resolving the litigated matters, the company recorded a tax reserve of $438 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2020. While the company disagrees with the IRS' position and intends to vigorously defend its position, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment sustained by the U.S. Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. The company has therefore calculated the potential liability of approximately $12 billion that could result from the application of the IRS' 

2

proposed transfer pricing methodology to relevant foreign licensees, including taxes and interest accrued through Dec. 31, 2020. The company would also have an incremental annual tax liability for future years that would increase its underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) by approximately 3.5%. For more details, refer to Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 10, 2021.

•Building loved brands and continuing to step up execution: During the year, the company prioritized core brands, which resulted in Trademark Coca-Cola volume growing 1% for the quarter, led by Coca-Cola® Zero Sugar with volume growth of 3% for the quarter and 4% for the full year. In away-from-home channels, the company took action to capture available opportunities. In the United States, the company developed new, multi-serve takeout bundles for drive-through channels and innovated with touchless Freestyle equipment. In digital channels, the company continued to invest in omnichannel opportunities. For example, the company capitalized on the booming trend of retail online-to-offline (O2O) in China. By focusing on digital execution excellence and core SKU availability, the company gained 3 points of value share during the year across these platforms, which are leading overall digital commerce growth in China.

•Networked organization model to improve agility and maximize scale: The company continued to make progress in establishing its networked organizational model, which is enabling the company's strategic transformation. The networked design includes a drive toward greater standardization and simplification, with technology and data at the forefront. Comprised of operating units, category teams, Platform Services and center functions, the company's new organizational structure combines the power of scale with local execution. The new structure has resulted in an approximate 11% net reduction in roles, excluding the Bottling Investments and Global Ventures operating segments. The structure became effective Jan. 1, 2021, with ongoing work to stand up Platform Services continuing through the first half of 2021.

•Progress toward a better shared future: The company continues to remain focused on its long-term sustainability goals, creating value for a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Building on our World Without Waste strategy of creating a circular economy for our packaging materials, the Coca-Cola system has set a goal to reduce virgin PET plastic usage by a cumulative 3 million metric tons by 2025, based on the projected growth of the system's virgin PET use. With respect to water, the company joined several multi-stakeholder initiatives during 2020, including the Water Resilience Coalition, a CEO-led initiative to reduce water stress by 2050, and WASH4WORK, which is addressing water, sanitation and hygiene challenges in the workplace. During 2020, the company also launched a racial equity plan in the United States to address inequities in local markets and empower people to take action.

Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.

1 For Bottling Investments, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes.

2 Organic revenues, comparable currency neutral operating income and comparable currency neutral EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.

3 Due to the combination of multiple business models in the Global Ventures segment, the composition of concentrate sales and price/mix may fluctuate materially on a periodic basis. Therefore, the company places greater focus on revenue growth as the best indicator of underlying performance of the segment.

4 Reported operating loss for Global Ventures for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was $9 million. Reported operating income for Global Ventures for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was $118 million. Therefore, the percent change is not meaningful.

In addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following: 

Consolidated

•Price/mix declined 3% for the quarter, driven by negative channel and package mix due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Concentrate sales were 3 points ahead of unit case volume, primarily due to two additional days in the quarter (a 2-point benefit) and cycling the Brexit-related inventory reduction in the prior year. For the full year, concentrate sales were 1 point behind unit case volume, primarily due to the timing of shipments across operating groups.

5

•Unit case volume declined 3% for the quarter and 6% for the year, as continued strength in at-home channels was more than offset by coronavirus-related pressure in away-from-home channels. While developing and emerging markets remained resilient in the quarter, developed markets continued to be under pressure. Category cluster performance was as follows:

◦Sparkling soft drinks declined 1% for the quarter and 4% for the year. For both the quarter and the full year, the decline was primarily due to pressure in the fountain business in North America and away-from-home channels in Western Europe due to the coronavirus pandemic. This was partially offset by growth in China, Brazil and Nigeria. Trademark Coca-Cola grew 1% for the quarter and declined 1% for the year. Trademark Coca-Cola growth in the quarter was driven by positive performance in most operating groups. Coca-Cola® Zero Sugar grew 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. 

◦Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages declined 2% for the quarter and 9% for the year, as solid performance by Simply® and fairlife® in North America was more than offset by a decline in Minute Maid® in the fountain business. Volume was further impacted by pressure in the Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East & Africa operating groups.

◦Water, enhanced water and sports drinks declined 9% for the quarter and 11% for the year, led by a broad-based decline across operating groups, primarily due to a decline in lower-margin water brands. 

◦Tea and coffee declined 15% for the quarter and 17% for the year, primarily driven by coronavirus-related pressure on Costa® retail stores, along with pressure on the doğadan® tea business in Turkey. 

•Operating income grew 8% for the quarter and declined 11% for the year, which included items impacting comparability in addition to currency headwinds. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 14% for the quarter and was even for the year, driven by effective cost management across operating groups offset by top-line pressure due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Europe, Middle East & Africa

•Price/mix declined 5% for the quarter driven by negative channel and package mix in Europe. Concentrate sales were 3 points ahead of unit case volume, largely due to two additional days in the quarter and cycling the Brexit-related inventory reduction in the prior year.

•Unit case volume declined 4% for the quarter, primarily due to coronavirus-related pressure in away-from-home channels in Europe and South Africa, partially offset by growth in Western Africa and Turkey.

•Operating income grew 13% in the quarter, impacted by headwinds from comparability items and currency. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 23% driven by effective cost management.

•For the year, the company lost value share in total NARTD beverages, primarily due to share losses across most category clusters, partially offset by a share gain in sparkling soft drinks.

Latin America

•Price/mix declined 4% for the quarter driven by negative package mix along with cycling solid pricing in the prior year. Concentrate sales were 4 points ahead of unit case volume, driven by two additional days in the quarter and cycling the timing of shipments in Brazil in the prior year.

•Unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter, led by solid performance in sparkling soft drinks in Brazil, partially offset by a decline in away-from-home channels in Mexico.

•Operating income declined 14% in the quarter, which included items impacting comparability and a 25-point currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 10%, primarily due to effective cost management across all business units.

6

•For the year, the company gained value share in total NARTD beverages in addition to all category clusters.

North America

•Price/mix grew 3% for the quarter, as solid growth in juice and dairy finished-goods brands was partially offset by pressure in the fountain business and away-from-home channels. Concentrate sales were 1 point ahead of unit case volume, driven by two additional days in the quarter partially offset by the timing of shipments.

•Unit case volume declined 7% for the quarter, as strong growth in sparkling soft drinks in at-home channels along with growth in AHA®, fairlife® and Powerade Zero® was more than offset by a decline in the fountain business. 

•Operating income grew 32% in the quarter, which included a tailwind from items impacting comparability. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 23% driven by pricing and effective cost management.

•For the year, the company lost value share in total NARTD beverages due to coronavirus-related restrictions in away-from-home channels, where the company has a strong share position.

Asia Pacific

•Price/mix declined 1% for the quarter, primarily due to negative channel mix in key markets. Concentrate sales were 3 points behind unit case volume due to cycling the timing of shipments in China in the prior year, partially offset by two additional days in the quarter.

•Unit case volume declined 4% for the quarter, primarily due to adverse weather in Southeast Asia along with coronavirus-related pressure in away-from-home channels in most markets in the region. Volume performance included solid growth in sparkling soft drinks in China and India.

•Operating income declined 2% in the quarter, which included a 3-point currency tailwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) declined 6%, driven by pressure in away-from-home channels in Japan and Australia, partially offset by effective cost management.

•For the year, the company's value share in total NARTD beverages was even as a share gain in the tea and coffee category cluster was offset by share losses in the other category clusters. 

Global Ventures

•Net revenues declined 14% in the quarter, which included a 2-point currency tailwind. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) declined 17%. The revenue declines were primarily driven by coronavirus-related pressure on Costa® retail stores, partially offset by strong performance in Costa® Express machines in the United Kingdom.

•The operating loss in the quarter was primarily driven by coronavirus-related pressure on Costa® retail stores.

Bottling Investments

•Price/mix grew 6% for the quarter driven by pricing and trade promotion optimization in most markets.

•Unit case volume declined 7% for the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic across key markets and adverse weather in Southeast Asia.

•Operating income growth of 35% in the quarter included a tailwind from items impacting comparability and a headwind from currency. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 25% driven by solid pricing and effective operating expense management.

Outlook

The 2021 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full year 2021 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2021 projected reported net revenues, full year 2021 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2021 projected reported net revenues, full year 2021 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full year 2021 projected reported effective tax rate or full year 2021 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full year 2021 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the exact timing and amount of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes; and the exact timing and amount of comparability items throughout 2021. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our full year 2021 reported financial results.

Full Year 2021

The company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) percentage growth of high single digits.

For comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency tailwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.

The company's underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.5%.

Given the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth of high single digits to low double digits versus $1.95 in 2020. This includes a 3% to 4% currency tailwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.

The company expects to deliver free cash flow (non-GAAP) of at least $8.5 billion through cash flow from operations of at least $10.0 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to the ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.

First Quarter 2021 Considerations

Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include a minimal currency impact based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.

Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) is expected to include an approximate 2% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.

The first quarter has five additional days compared to first quarter 2020.

Notes

•All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period.

•All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales for the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. "Unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa® non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. "Unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.

•"Concentrate sales" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa® non-ready-to-drink beverage products, "concentrate sales" represents the amount of coffee beans and finished beverages (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, "concentrate sales" represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. 

•"Price/mix" represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.

•First quarter 2020 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to the same period in 2019, and fourth quarter 2020 financial results were impacted by two additional days as compared to the same period in 2019. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.

Conference Call

The company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2020 operating results today, Feb. 10, 2021, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company’s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the "Investors" section.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(UNAUDITED)

The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred to herein as "reported"). To supplement our consolidated financial statements reported on a GAAP basis, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures: "comparable net revenues", "comparable currency neutral net revenues", "organic revenues", "comparable operating margin", "underlying operating margin", "comparable operating income", "comparable currency neutral operating income", "comparable EPS", "comparable currency neutral EPS", "underlying effective tax rate" and "free cash flow", each of which are defined below. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Further, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are also included below. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance.

DEFINITIONS

•"Currency neutral operating results" are determined by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results, by the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as appropriate, the derived current period local currency operating results by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to translate the company's financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not changed from the comparable prior year period.

•"Structural changes" generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations including the impact of intercompany transactions among our operating segments. In 2019, the company acquired controlling interests in bottling operations in Zambia, Eswatini and Kenya. The impact of these acquisitions has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Europe, Middle East and Africa and Bottling Investments operating segments. In 2019, the company refranchised certain of its bottling operations in India. The impact of this refranchising activity has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments.

•"Comparable net revenues" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). "Comparable currency neutral net revenues" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below) as well as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes the comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) growth measure and the comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP) growth measure provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's revenue performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period results. "Organic revenues" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes, as applicable, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes the organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth measure provides users with useful supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing revenue performance and trends by presenting revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. The adjustments related to acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 consisted of the structural changes discussed above. Additionally, in 2020, the company acquired the remaining equity ownership interest in fairlife, LLC ("fairlife"). The impact on revenues for fairlife products not previously sold by the company has been

included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment. Also in 2020, the company discontinued our Odwalla juice business. The impact of discontinuing our Odwalla juice business has been included in acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment. In 2019, the company acquired the remaining equity ownership interest in C.H.I. Limited ("CHI"). The impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

•"Comparable operating income" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). "Comparable currency neutral operating income" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below) and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. "Comparable operating margin" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). "Underlying operating margin" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below), the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes, as applicable. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable operating income (non-GAAP) growth measure, comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) growth measure, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) measure and underlying operating margin (non-GAAP) measure enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results.

•"Comparable EPS" and "comparable currency neutral EPS" are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) has also been adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable EPS (non-GAAP) and comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth measures enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results.

•"Underlying effective tax rate" is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the estimated annual effective income tax rate on income before income taxes, which excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). 

•"Free cash flow" is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions.

ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY

The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as "items impacting comparability" based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions; and evaluates the company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as pertaining to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered "items impacting comparability." Items impacting comparability include, but are not limited to, asset impairments, charges related to our strategic realignment initiatives, charges related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives, and transaction gains/losses, in each case when exceeding a U.S. dollar threshold. Also included are our proportionate share of similar items incurred by our equity method investees, timing

differences related to our economic (non-designated) hedging activities, and timing differences related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments of equity securities and trading debt securities, regardless of size. In addition, we provide the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency neutral operating results" defined above).

Asset Impairments

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $252 million related to Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. ("CCBJHI"), an equity method investee. Based on the length of time and the extent to which the market value of our investment in CCBJHI was less than our carrying value and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, management determined that the decline in fair value was other than temporary in nature.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded impairment charges of $160 million related to discontinuing our Odwalla juice business and recorded an impairment charge of $55 million related to a trademark in North America, which was primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, revised projections of future operating results and a change in brand focus in the company's portfolio. The company also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $38 million related to one of our equity method investees in Latin America and an impairment charge of $26 million associated with an investment in an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. These impairment charges were primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results. In addition, the company recorded a charge of $13 million for the impairment of goodwill in our bottling operations in the Middle East, which was primarily driven by a recent change in sugar tax laws, and recorded impairment charges totaling $10 million related to several trademarks in Latin America, which were primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and management’s view of the timing and extent of recovery. 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the company recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of $406 million related to CCBJHI, an equity method investee. Based on the length of time and the extent to which the market value of our investment in CCBJHI was less than our carrying value and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, management determined that the decline in fair value was other than temporary in nature. The company also recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of $255 million related to certain equity method investees in the Middle East. The impairment charges of $255 million were primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results largely related to instability in the region and changes in local excise taxes. In addition, the company recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of $57 million related to one of our equity method investees in North America and $49 million related to one of our equity method investees in Latin America. These impairment charges were primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results. The company also recorded an impairment charge of $42 million related to a trademark in Asia Pacific, which was primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results for the trademark. 

Strategic Realignment

In August 2020, the company announced strategic steps to transform our organizational structure in an effort to better enable us to capture growth in the fast-changing marketplace. The company is building a networked global organization comprised of operating units, category leads, Platform Services and the center. The operating units will be highly interconnected with more consistency in the structure and a focus on eliminating duplication of resources and scaling new products more quickly. The global marketing category leadership teams will primarily focus on innovation, marketing efficiency and effectiveness. The organizational structure will also include the center, which will provide strategy, governance and scale for global initiatives. The operating units, global marketing category leadership teams, and the center will be supported by Platform Services, which will focus on providing efficient and scaled global services and capabilities including, but not limited to, governance, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and social/digital hubs. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded charges of $84 million and $427 million, respectively, primarily related to severance costs associated with our strategic realignment initiatives.

Productivity and Reinvestment

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, the company recorded charges of $80 million and $264 million, respectively. These charges were related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. The costs incurred in 2019 were related to initiatives focused on four key areas: restructuring the company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget principles across the organization; streamlining and simplifying the company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing investments. Under this operating model, our business units are supported by an expanded enabling services organization and a corporate center focused on a few strategic initiatives, policy and governance. The expanded enabling services organization focuses on both simplifying and standardizing key transactional processes and providing support to business units through global centers of excellence. The savings realized from the program enable the company to fund marketing initiatives and innovation required to deliver sustainable net revenue growth. The savings also support margin expansion and increased returns on invested capital over time. The costs incurred in 2020 were primarily related to certain remaining initiatives designed to further simplify and standardize our enabling services organization.

As a result, CCBA no longer qualified as held for sale. The amounts in this line item represent the depreciation and amortization that the company would have recorded had CCBA not been classified as held for sale.

Other Items

The company uses derivatives as economic hedges primarily to mitigate the foreign exchange risk for certain currencies and the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings. 

The company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of income. Management believes this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our economic hedging activities.
