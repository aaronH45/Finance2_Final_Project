Item 8.01.Other Events.

On February 8, 2021, Kinder Morgan, Inc. (“KMI”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Barclays Capital Inc., CIBC World Markets Corp., SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. and TD Securities (USA) LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, pursuant to which KMI agreed to sell $750,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of KMI’s 3.600% Senior Notes due 2051 (the “Notes”).

The Notes are guaranteed pursuant to a Cross Guarantee Agreement, which is described in and filed as Exhibit 10.14 to KMI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by KMI. The Underwriting Agreement also contains customary indemnification and contribution provisions whereby KMI and the underwriters have agreed to indemnify each other against certain liabilities. The Notes were offered and sold under a prospectus supplement and related prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-240108).

The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 1, 2012, between KMI and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2051. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2021. Interest on the Notes will accrue from February 11, 2021. KMI may redeem all or a part of the Notes at any time at the applicable redemption prices.

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, which includes payment defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants and bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, the obligations of KMI under the Notes may be accelerated, in which case the entire principal amount of the Notes would be immediately due and payable.

The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

KMI expects to use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes. The underwriters and their related entities have, from time to time, engaged in commercial and investment banking transactions with KMI and its affiliates and provided financial advisory services for KMI and its affiliates in the ordinary course of their business, and may do so in the future. The underwriters and their related entities have received and in the future will receive customary compensation and expense reimbursement for these commercial and investment banking transactions and financial advisory services.
