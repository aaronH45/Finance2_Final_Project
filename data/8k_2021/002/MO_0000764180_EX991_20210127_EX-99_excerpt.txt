Cash Returns to Shareholders

•Yesterday, Altria’s Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which Altria expects to complete by June 30, 2022. Share repurchases depend on marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of Altria’s Board.

•Altria’s current annualized dividend rate is $3.44 per share, representing a dividend yield of 8.2% as of January 25, 2021. 

•Altria has a long-term objective of a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of Altria’s Board.

Noncombustible Products Business Platform 

Heated Tobacco

•In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the IQOS 3 device for sale in the U.S. The new device has a longer battery life and a faster re-charging time compared to the currently authorized 2.4 version. PM USA expects to begin selling the new device shortly and that it will be made available across all existing retail channels in the Atlanta, Charlotte and Richmond markets.

•In the fourth quarter, PM USA introduced IQOS devices for sale in select Charlotte convenience stores. 

•PM USA recently introduced new packaging for Marlboro HeatSticks and has renamed the three currently authorized Marlboro HeatSticks variants as Amber, Blue Menthol and Green Menthol. 

•As previously announced, PM USA plans to expand IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks into four new metro markets and surrounding geographies in 2021. 

Oral Tobacco

•In the fourth quarter, Helix expanded the distribution of on! by an additional 22,000 stores. on! is now available in approximately 78,000 stores as of the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of nearly 40% from the end of the third quarter and more than five times the store count from the end of 2019. 

•In stores with distribution, on! achieved a retail share of 2.4 percentage points of the oral tobacco category for full-year 2020. 

•In the fourth quarter, Helix reached annualized manufacturing capacity for on! of 50 million cans. Helix expects unconstrained on! manufacturing capacity for the U.S. market by mid-year 2021. 

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

Effect on Financial Results

•For full-year 2020, Altria recorded net pre-tax charges of $50 million (all of which were recorded in the second quarter), directly related to costs for disruptions caused by, or efforts to mitigate the impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic. These net pre-tax charges included premium pay, personal protective equipment and health screenings, partially offset by certain employment tax credits.

•In 2020, Ste. Michelle’s on-premise and direct-to-consumer sales were significantly impacted by COVID-19 and Ste. Michelle expects continued impact to these sales channels while many governmental restrictions on dining and gatherings remain in place.

◦For full-year 2020, Ste. Michelle recorded pre-tax charges of $411 million in cost of sales, consisting primarily of a $292 million inventory write off and $100 million in estimated losses on future non-cancelable grape purchase commitments.  The pre-tax charges were based on wine inventory levels significantly exceeding forecasted product demand. 

Impact on Tobacco Business Operations

•To date, Altria’s tobacco businesses have not experienced any material adverse effects associated with governmental actions to restrict consumer movement or business operations, but continue to monitor these factors. The majority of retail stores in which their products are sold, including convenience stores, have been deemed to be essential businesses by authorities and remain open. 

2

•Altria continues to monitor the macroeconomic risks of COVID-19 and its effect on adult tobacco consumers (ATCs), including stay-at-home practices, disposable income (which may be impacted by unemployment rates and fiscal stimulus), purchasing patterns and adoption of noncombustible products. 

Impact on ABI and Cronos Investments

•ABI has been impacted by COVID-19, resulting in (i) a 50% reduction to its final 2019 dividend paid in the second quarter of 2020 and a decision to forgo its interim 2020 dividend that would have been paid in the fourth quarter of 2020; (ii) the withdrawal of its guidance for 2020 due to the uncertainty and volatility; and (iii) a goodwill impairment charge related to its Africa businesses in its second quarter of 2020 (which Altria recorded in the third quarter of 2020 due to its one-quarter lag in reporting ABI’s results). Although the environment remains volatile and uncertain, including renewed restrictions in several markets, ABI stated in its latest quarterly earnings report (third-quarter 2020) that it expects its performance in the second half of 2020 to be better than the first half of 2020.  In addition, the extreme market disruption and volatility associated with COVID-19 resulted in a steep decline in ABI’s stock price in the first half of 2020. Although there was a gradual recovery in ABI’s stock price in the second half of 2020, the fair value of Altria’s investment in ABI remains below the carrying value. While Altria believes that this decline is temporary, it will continue to monitor its investment in ABI, including the impact of COVID-19 on ABI’s business and market valuation.

•Altria has considered the impact of COVID-19 on the business of Cronos, including its sales, distribution, operations, supply chain and liquidity. During the second quarter of 2020, Cronos recorded an impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the impact of COVID-19 (which Altria recorded in the third quarter of 2020 due to its one-quarter lag in reporting Cronos’s results). Altria will continue to monitor its investment in Cronos, including the impact of COVID-19 on Cronos’s business and market valuation. 

JUUL Investment Update

In November, Altria exercised its right to convert its non-voting shares in JUUL to voting shares (Share Conversion) pursuant to its December 2018 investment in JUUL. Altria does not currently intend to exercise its additional governance rights obtained upon Share Conversion, including the right to elect directors to JUUL’s board, or to vote its JUUL shares other than as a passive investor, pending the outcome of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission litigation. 

Following Share Conversion in the fourth quarter of 2020, Altria elected to account for its investment in JUUL under the fair value option. Under this option, Altria’s consolidated statement of earnings includes any cash dividends received from its investment in JUUL as well as any change in the fair value of the investment, which is calculated quarterly. These fair value changes are treated as special items and are excluded from Altria’s adjusted results. 

2021 Full-Year Guidance

Altria expects its 2021 full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in a range of $4.49 to $4.62, representing a growth rate of 3% to 6% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $4.36 in 2020. While the 2021 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance accounts for a range of scenarios, the external environment remains dynamic. Altria will continue to monitor conditions related to (i) unemployment rates, (ii) fiscal stimulus, (iii) ATC dynamics, including stay-at-home practices, disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of noncombustible products, (iv) regulatory and legislative (including excise tax) developments, (v) the timing and breadth of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and (vi) expectations for adjusted earnings contributions from its alcohol assets. 

Altria’s 2021 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes planned investments in support of its 10-year Vision, such as (i) marketplace investments to expand the availability and awareness of Altria’s noncombustible products, (ii) costs associated with building an industry-leading consumer engagement platform that enhances data collection and insights in support of ATC conversion to noncombustible products and (iii) increased 

3

noncombustible product research and development expense. Altria expects 2021 adjusted diluted EPS growth to come in the last three quarters of the year, primarily due to prior year comparisons, including one fewer shipping day for the smokeable products segment in the first quarter. Altria expects its 2021 full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of 24.5% to 25.5%. 

Altria expects 2021 capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $250 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $250 million. 

Altria expects 2021 cigarette industry volume trends to be most influenced by (i) adult smoker (AS) stay-at-home practices, (ii) unemployment rates, (iii) fiscal stimulus, (iv) cross-category movement, (v) the timing and breadth of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and (vi) AS purchasing behavior following the vaccine. Due to the uncertain timing and magnitude of each of these dynamics, Altria is not providing a cigarette industry outlook. Altria will continue to provide updates on the pandemic-driven and underlying AS behaviors observed in the category. 

Altria’s full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance and full-year forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, for example, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, COVID-19 special items, equity investment-related special items (including any changes in fair value of the equity investment and any related warrants and preemptive rights), certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, and resolutions of certain nonparticipating manufacturer (NPM) adjustment disputes under the Master Settlement Agreement (such dispute resolutions are referred to as NPM Adjustment Items).

Altria’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on its reported diluted EPS or its reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result, Altria does not provide a corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted EPS guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast.

See “Basis of Presentation” below for an explanation of financial measures and reporting segments discussed in this release. 

Financial Performance

Fourth Quarter

•Net revenues increased 4.9% to $6.3 billion, primarily driven by higher net revenues in the smokeable products segment, partially offset by lower net revenues in the all other category (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual value of certain assets at PMCC in 2020). Revenues net of excise taxes increased 5.3% to $5.1 billion.

•Reported diluted EPS increased 100%+ to $1.03, primarily driven by 2019 impairment of JUUL equity securities, higher reported OCI in the smokeable products and oral tobacco products segments, a lower loss in the wine segment and income in 2020 from an increase in the estimated fair value of Altria’s investment in JUUL. These factors were partially offset by lower reported earnings from Altria’s investments in ABI (including ABI-related special items), higher income taxes (including special items), higher reported losses in the all other category (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual value of certain assets at PMCC in 2020), and lower net income on Cronos-related special items. 

4

•Adjusted diluted EPS decreased 2.0% to $0.99, primarily driven by adjusted losses in the all other category (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual value of certain assets at PMCC in 2020), lower adjusted earnings from Altria’s investment in ABI, higher income taxes, higher corporate expenses (primarily driven by timing of spend) and higher financing costs, partially offset by higher adjusted OCI in the smokeable products segment. 

Full Year

•Net revenues increased 4.2% to $26.2 billion primarily due to higher net revenues in the smokeable products and oral tobacco products segments, partially offset by lower net revenues in the all other category (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual value of certain assets at PMCC in 2020) and the wine segment. Revenues net of excise taxes increased 5.3% to $20.8 billion.

•Reported diluted EPS increased 100+% to $2.40, primarily driven by 2019 impairment of JUUL equity securities, higher reported OCI in the smokeable and oral tobacco products segments, lower net losses on Cronos-related special items, income in 2020 from an increase in the estimated fair value of Altria’s investment in JUUL and fewer shares outstanding. These factors were partially offset by 2020 impairment of JUUL equity securities (recorded in the third quarter of 2020), lower reported earnings from Altria’s investment in ABI (including ABI-related special items), inventory-related charges in the wine segment in 2020, higher income taxes (including special items) and higher reported losses in the all other category (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual value of certain assets at PMCC in 2020).

•Adjusted diluted EPS increased 3.6% to $4.36, primarily driven by higher adjusted OCI in the smokeable products and oral tobacco products segments and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower adjusted earnings from Altria’s investments in ABI and Cronos, higher adjusted losses in the all other category (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual value of certain assets at PMCC in 2020), higher income taxes, lower adjusted OCI in the wine segment and higher financing costs.

This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes. For other trade classes selling cigarettes, retail share is based on shipments from wholesalers to retailers (STARS). This service is not designed to capture sales through other channels, including the internet, direct mail and some illicitly tax-advantaged outlets. It is IRI’s standard practice to periodically refresh its services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.

Full Year

•Oral tobacco products segment reported domestic shipment volume increased 1.2%, primarily driven by the industry’s growth rate, calendar differences and other factors, partially offset by retail share losses (primarily due to the growth of oral nicotine pouches) and trade inventory movements. When adjusted for calendar differences, trade inventory movements and other factors, oral tobacco products segment shipment volume increased by an estimated 1%. 

•Total oral tobacco industry volume increased by an estimated 6% over the past six months, primarily driven by growth in oral nicotine pouches.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 1 Other includes Red Seal and on!.

Note: Volume includes cans and packs sold, as well as promotional units, but excludes international volume, which is currently not material to the oral tobacco products segment. New types of oral tobacco products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing oral tobacco products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis. To calculate volumes of cans and packs shipped, one pack of snus or one can of oral nicotine pouches, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST. 

12

Retail Share & Brand Activity

Altria’s retail share performance for the current and comparable periods includes MST, snus and oral nicotine pouch products.

Fourth Quarter

•Oral tobacco products segment retail share was 49.0% and Copenhagen continued to be the leading oral tobacco brand with a retail share of 31.2%. Share losses for both the segment and Copenhagen were due to the growth of oral nicotine pouches.

Full Year

•Oral tobacco products segment retail share was 49.8% and Copenhagen continued to be the leading oral tobacco brand with a retail share of 31.9%. Share losses for both the segment and Copenhagen were due to the growth of oral nicotine pouches.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: The oral tobacco products retail share results exclude international volume. Retail share results for oral tobacco products are based on data from IRI InfoScan, a tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share and depict share trends. This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes on the number of cans and packs sold. Oral tobacco products is defined by IRI as moist smokeless, snus and oral nicotine pouches. New types of oral tobacco products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing oral tobacco products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis. For example, one pack of snus or one can of oral nicotine pouches, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST. Because this service represents retail share performance only in key trade channels, it should not be considered a precise measurement of actual retail share. It is IRI’s standard practice to periodically refresh its InfoScan services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.

Basis of Presentation

Altria reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. Altria’s management reviews OCI, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, the segments. Altria’s management also reviews certain financial results, including OCI, OCI margins and diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items, including those items noted under “2021 Full-Year Guidance.” Altria’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of Altria’s underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis. Altria’s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate. Altria’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. Altria’s management uses adjusted financial measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. These adjusted financial measures are not consistent with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of historical adjusted financial measures to corresponding GAAP measures are provided in this release.

Altria uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in ABI and Cronos and reports its share of ABI’s and Cronos’s results using a one-quarter lag because ABI’s and Cronos’s results are not available in time to record them in the concurrent period. The one-quarter reporting lag for ABI and Cronos does not affect Altria’s cash flows. Following Share Conversion in the fourth quarter of 2020, Altria elected to account for its investment in JUUL under the fair value option. Prior to this date, Altria accounted for its investment in JUUL as an investment in an equity security.

Altria’s reportable segments are smokeable products, including combustible cigarettes and cigars manufactured and sold by PM USA and Middleton; oral tobacco products, including MST and snus products manufactured and sold by USSTC, and oral nicotine pouches sold by Helix; and wine, produced and/or distributed by Ste. Michelle. Results for innovative tobacco products and PMCC are included in “All Other.”

Comparisons are to the corresponding prior-year period unless otherwise stated.

•the risks related to Ste. Michelle’s wine business, including competition, unfavorable changes in grape supply, and changes in adult consumer preferences that have resulted and may continue to result in increased inventory levels and inventory write offs, and governmental regulations;

•the risks generally related to our investments in JUUL and Cronos, including our inability to realize the expected benefits of our investments in the expected time frames, or at all, due to the risks encountered by our investees in their businesses, such as operational, compliance and regulatory risks at the international, federal, state and local levels, including actions by the FDA, and adverse publicity; potential disruptions to our investees’ management or current or future plans and operations; domestic or international litigation developments, government investigations, tax disputes or otherwise; and impairment of our investment in Cronos and changes in the fair value of our investment in JUUL;
