On February 18, 2021, Citrix Systems, Inc. (the “Company”) completed its issuance and sale of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.250% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated February 9, 2021 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), among the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, and an Indenture dated as of November 15, 2017, as supplemented and amended by a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 18, 2021 (the “Third Supplemental Indenture”), each between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Underwriting Agreement was filed as Exhibit 1.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 11, 2021. The Notes were issued and sold under the Company’s effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-249751) and a related prospectus supplement and prospectus filed with the SEC.  

The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the applicable redemption prices specified in the form of Note included in Exhibit 4.2 hereto (the “Form of Note”).  

In the event that (a) the Company does not consummate its previously announced acquisition of Wrangler Topco, LLC, the parent entity of Wrike, Inc. (the “Wrike Merger”), on or prior to June 30, 2021, or (b) the Agreement and Plan of Merger relating to the Wrike Merger is terminated any time prior thereto, the Company will be required to redeem all of the outstanding Notes on a special mandatory redemption date at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the special mandatory redemption date described in the Third Supplemental Indenture.  

In addition, if a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as defined in the Form of Note) occurs with respect to the Notes, the Company will be required, subject to certain exceptions, to offer to repurchase all or any part of the Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes to, but excluding, the repurchase date.  

The foregoing description of the terms of the Notes is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the complete terms and conditions of the Third Supplemental Indenture and the Form of Note, which are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 hereto, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Sidley Austin LLP provided the Company with the legal opinion attached hereto as Exhibit 5.1.
