        "The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of September 30, 2020 through January 25, 2021, the date the combined financial statements were available to be issued. During the fourth quarter of 2020, Pilot Travel Centers LLC exercised an option to purchase our 29 percent interest in PFJ Southeast LLC, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We expect the purchase to close in 2021 and to account for our equity method investment in PFJ Southeast LLC as an asset held for sale beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020."
