Year-end 2020 operating earnings were $2.199 billion or $4.44 per share, compared with operating earnings of $2.095 billion or $4.24 per share for year-end 2019.

“Throughout 2020, our employees continued their critical work to keep safe, reliable power flowing to our customers during the pandemic. I’m grateful for their agility and commitment to providing this essential service in our communities. We remain focused on working proactively with our customers to help them manage their energy bills and offer support for those who are facing economic hardships during this time,” said Nicholas K. Akins, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.

“Our earnings performance in 2020 was driven by our long-term strategy to invest in the infrastructure and energy solutions that enhance service for our customers and support the transition to a clean energy future, while remaining focused on cost efficiency. We’ve raised our 2021 operating earnings guidance range to $4.55 to $4.75 per share based on these results and are committed to our long-term growth rate of 5% to 7% from this revised guidance.

“We continue to transform our generation fleet and plan to add more than 10,000 megawatts of wind and solar generation in our regulated states by 2030. We’ve also established revised carbon dioxide emissions reduction goals as we accelerate our transition to a clean energy future. Our new goals are to achieve an 80% reduction in emissions by 2030 from our 2000 baseline and reach net zero emissions by 2050. We are focused on diversifying our fuel mix, deploying and investing in new technologies, and modernizing the grid to help us meet these targets and deliver clean energy to our customers,” Akins said.

 “Investments in our transmission system will help ensure we can maintain a reliable and resilient grid and advance the adoption of efficient, cost-effective renewables to support the path to net zero emissions. In 2020, our Transmission Holding Co. contributed $1.03 per share to operating earnings, and net plant assets grew by $1.3 billion, or 13%.

“We saw some improvement in load at the end of 2020 as the economy began to bounce back from the impacts of the pandemic. Overall, we expect modest load growth this year as the economy continues to recover, led by expected growth in industrial sales,” Akins said.

EARNINGS GUIDANCE 

AEP management raised its 2021 operating earnings guidance range to $4.55 to $4.75 per share. Operating earnings could differ from GAAP earnings for matters such as impairments, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. AEP management is not able to forecast if any of these items will occur or any amounts that may be reported for future periods. Therefore, AEP is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for earnings guidance.
