Financial Outlook   

Tony Tripeny, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said, “In 2020, we successfully navigated a very challenging year. We strengthened our balance sheet, achieved growth in the second half, and generated free cash flow of $948 million for the year.”   

 ﻿  

 Tripeny continued, “We expect year-over-year growth to accelerate in the first quarter of 2021. We expect core sales of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion – compared with $2.5 billion in the first quarter last year – and EPS of $0.40 to $0.44, which is double last year’s first-quarter EPS at the low end of the range. We will continue to focus on operational excellence, cash-flow generation, and prudent capital allocation.”  

 ﻿  

 Market-Access Platform Highlights  

 Corning holds a leadership position in each of the markets addressed by its five Market-Access Platforms. Throughout 2020, the company advanced important growth initiatives and reported the following highlights:   

 ﻿  

   ·    Life Sciences – Corning deployed its broad Life Sciences capabilities to combat the pandemic by supplying technologies that help customers develop novel treatments and vaccines, provide mass testing, and accelerate vaccine production. In the second quarter, Corning was awarded $204 million in funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to substantially expand domestic manufacturing capacity for Corning Valor® Glass vials. In the fourth quarter, Corning shipped Valor Glass vials to multiple COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers that support more than 100 million doses. Corning also received a $15 million award from the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to further expand domestic production capacity for robotic pipette tips used in support of COVID-19 diagnostic testing. The company was also recognized by BioNTech for its role in the successful development of its COVID-19 vaccine.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    Optical Communications – Optical Communications returned to growth – and expects growth to continue – as customers increase spending to support growing bandwidth requirements. In 2020, the company introduced new and innovative solutions that help speed the deployment of 5G. Corning launched its Evolv™ 5G-ready connectivity solutions featuring compact, easy-to-install terminals that connect the fiber network to neighborhoods and businesses. Operators can save up to $500 at each terminal site by dramatically lowering installation costs and speeding deployment. By collaborating with Verizon, Corning is enabling 5G mmWave indoor deployments for enterprise customers. Additionally, Corning is working with Qualcomm Technologies to deliver indoor networks that are 5G-ready, easy-to-install, and affordable and with EnerSys to simplify the delivery of fiber and electrical power to small-cell wireless sites.

   ·    Display – Retail demand for TV and IT products remains strong. Demand for large-size TVs continues to grow – 75-inch sets were up more than 60% for the full year. Large TVs are most efficiently made on Gen 10.5 fabs and Corning is well-positioned to capture that growth with its Gen 10.5 plants in China, including its two newest Gen 10.5 facilities, in Wuhan and Guangzhou, which are now expanding production to meet customer demand.

 *Core performance measures are non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided in the tables following this news release, as well as on the company’s website. The largest difference between our GAAP and core results stemmed from restructuring charges, which are primarily non-cash, as well as non-cash, mark-to-market losses associated with the company’s currency-hedging contracts.

 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 ﻿  

 CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES   

 In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to report core performance measures. These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments, restructuring, impairment losses, and other charges and credits, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Corning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, new Taiwan dollar and the euro. The Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows. Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.  

 ﻿  

 Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the Company’s outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.  

 ﻿  

 For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures”.
