Stericycle, Inc. Reports Results

For the Fourth Quarter 2020

BANNOCKBURN, Ill., February 25, 2021 - Stericycle, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRCL) today reported results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020.

Revenues for the fourth quarter were $655.9 million, a decrease of 18.0% compared to $799.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year due to the impact of divestitures and the COVID-19 pandemic-related business disruption. Organic revenues declined 1.8% when excluding the impact of divestitures, foreign exchange rates, and changes in sorted office paper (“SOP”) pricing, primarily reflecting the impact of the pandemic-related business disruption. Income from operations was $93.2 million, compared to a loss from operations of $198.5 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Net income was $48.5 million, or $0.53 diluted earnings per share, compared to a net loss of $219.3 million, or $2.41 diluted loss per share, in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted income from operations was $108.6 million, compared to $122.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.59, compared to $0.72 in the fourth quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $530.2 million, compared to $248.0 million in 2019. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $410.7 million, compared to $53.8 million in 2019.

KEY BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS:

•Cash flow from operations increased to $530.2 million and free cash flow increased to $410.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $248.0 million and $53.8 million, respectively, in 2019.

•Regulated Waste and Compliance Services (“RWCS”) organic revenues grew 3.2% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact on maritime waste services from the pandemic, RWCS organic revenues grew 4.9%.

•Gross profit margin as a percent of revenues was 41.1%, an increase of 620 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to divestitures of lower margin businesses and quality of revenue and operating efficiency initiatives.

•The divestiture of the global product recall business, Expert Solutions, was completed in the fourth quarter for proceeds of $78.0 million, the eighth divestiture since January 2019 as the Company continued to rationalize its portfolio.

•Net debt was reduced by $207.2 million in the fourth quarter as a result of net proceeds from portfolio rationalization efforts and cash from operations, decreasing total net debt to approximately $1.74 billion. Since the beginning of 2020, we paid down net debt of $900.0 million, reducing the credit agreement defined debt leverage ratio to 3.54 times at December 31, 2020, compared to 4.45 times at December 31, 2019.

“Stericycle delivered a strong fourth quarter performance and continued to build on the momentum of our key business priorities in uncertain times,” said Cindy J. Miller, Chief Executive Officer. “We benefited from expanding margins through our quality of revenue initiatives, operating efficiency initiatives and portfolio rationalization, along with significant operating cash flow generation and disciplined capital expenditure deployment. Also, we achieved an effective internal control environment as of December 31, 2020, having successfully remediated material weaknesses.”

FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS 

U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) Results

•Revenues in the fourth quarter were $655.9 million, compared to $799.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Of the $144.0 million decline, the impact of divestitures was $133.7 million and lower Secure Information Destruction (“SID”) revenues, excluding SOP pricing, was $30.9 million, reflecting pandemic-related business disruption. The decline in revenues was partially offset by RWCS organic growth of $17.3 million and a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of $4.8 million.

•Income from operations in the fourth quarter was $93.2 million, compared to a loss from operations of $198.5 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The change was primarily due to no goodwill impairment in 2020 compared to goodwill impairment of $207.4 million in 2019, net divestiture gains of $42.6 million in 2020 compared to net divestiture losses of $24.9 million in 2019, and a decrease in Cost of Revenues and Selling, General and Administrative adjusted charges of $30.8 million, which are itemized in Table 2-A. 

•Net income in the fourth quarter was $48.5 million, or $0.53 diluted earnings per share, compared to a net loss of $219.3 million, or $2.41 diluted loss per share, in the fourth quarter of last year. The difference was related to higher income from operations of $291.7 million, as explained above, and lower interest expense of $7.3 million, which was partially offset by higher income tax expense of $31.9 million.

•Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $530.2 million, compared to $248.0 million in 2019. The year-over-year improvement of $282.2 million primarily includes:

◦U.S. CARES Act net operating loss carryback refunds received in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 for a total of $110.0 million 

◦lower payments for legal and professional fees, annual incentive compensation and prepaid software of $55.6 million compared to 2019

◦government relief tax-related payment deferrals of $30.2 million in 2020, roughly split two-thirds U.S. and one-third non-U.S.

◦lower interest payments of $26.0 million in 2020

◦advances received on executed service agreements of $19.2 million related to the Domestic Environmental Solutions divestiture in the second quarter of 2020

◦lower operating expenditures for ERP and related matters of approximately $20.0 million compared to 2019

•Cash paid for capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $119.5 million compared to $194.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the timing of 2019 investments in the ERP and disciplined capital management throughout 2020.

Non-GAAP Results

•For the fourth quarter of 2020, RWCS organic revenues grew 3.2%. Excluding the impact on maritime waste services from the pandemic, RWCS organic revenues grew 4.9%. Organic revenues of SID, excluding the impact of SOP pricing, declined 14.2%, and Communication and Related Services (“CRS”) declined 1.7%, primarily as a result of the pandemic-related business disruption. 

•Adjusted income from operations was $108.6 million, compared to $122.6 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange rates of $5.9 million, adjusted income from operations declined $8.1 million. Adjusted income from operations as a percent of revenues improved 130 basis points. Divestitures of lower margin businesses contributed approximately 200 basis points while quality of revenue and operating efficiency initiatives contributed almost 80 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by higher annual incentive compensation which reduced operating leverage by approximately 170 basis points. 

•Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.59, compared to $0.72 in the fourth quarter of last year. The decline includes a higher adjusted tax rate impact of $0.08, lower adjusted income from operations of $0.06, 

2

and the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange rates of $0.05. These factors were partially offset by lower interest expense of $0.06.

•Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $410.7 million, compared to $53.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The significant year-over-year improvement of $356.9 million was due to higher cash flow from operations and lower capital expenditures, as described above.

Table 1–C: COMPONENTS OF REVENUES CHANGE IN DOLLARS (UNAUDITED)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Growth is the change in revenues excluding the impact of SOP pricing, divestitures and foreign exchange.

(2)The comparisons at constant currency rates (foreign exchange) reflect comparative local currency balances at prior period’s foreign exchange rates. Stericycle calculated these percentages by taking current period reported Revenues less the respective prior period reported Revenues, divided by the prior period reported Revenues, all at the respective prior period’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in Revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period. Management believes the use of this measure aids in the understanding of changes in Revenues without the impact of foreign currency.

(3)For the three months ended December 31, 2019, RWCS revenues include $10.6 million associated with the Argentina business which was divested in July 2020; $111.0 million associated with the Domestic Environmental Solutions business which was divested in April 2020; $3.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, associated with Chile and Mexico operations, which were divested in 2019.

(a) The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release are reconciled to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the schedules attached to this release. Management believes the Non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of Stericycle’s performance because they provide additional information about Stericycle’s operations and exclude certain adjusting items, allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Additionally, the Company uses such Non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating business unit and management performance. All Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to or calculated in the same manner as Non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies.

(d) Under the Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders column, adjustments are shown net of tax in aggregate of $9.3 million and $35.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, based on applying the statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the adjustment occurred or, by adjusting the tax effect to consider the impact of applying an annual effective tax rate on an interim basis. For purposes of reconciling adjusted diluted earnings per share with respect to taxes period-over-period, the company utilizes a “rate approach” to highlight the impact of the adjusted tax rate. It is computed by multiplying the prior period adjusted rate by the current period adjusted income before taxes to determine the expected tax expense. Such expected tax expense is then compared to actual tax expense. Expected tax in excess of actual tax variance is favorable; actual tax in excess of expected tax variance is unfavorable. The variance divided by diluted shares outstanding at the end of the period yields the impact on earnings per share. Management believes the use of this measure best aids in explaining the impact of a changing tax rate.

It is computed by multiplying the prior period adjusted rate by the current period adjusted income before taxes to determine the expected tax expense. Such expected tax expense is then compared to actual tax expense. Expected tax in excess of actual tax variance is favorable; actual tax in excess of expected tax variance is unfavorable. The variance divided by diluted shares outstanding at the end of the period yields the impact on earnings per share. Management believes the use of this measure best aids in explaining the impact of a changing tax rate.
