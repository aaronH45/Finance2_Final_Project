 Full Year 2020 Highlights (all comparisons to full year 2019, unless otherwise noted)    Reported EPS of $0.89 and Adjusted EPS2 of $1.74   Reported EPS includes after-tax adjusted items of approximately $111.1 million, including realignment, transformation, below-the-line foreign exchange impacts and certain non-cash impairments       Total bookings were $3.41 billion, down 19.5%, or 18.9% on a constant currency basis   Original equipment bookings were $1.62 billion, or 48% of total bookings, down 26.7%, or 26.4% on a constant currency basis   Aftermarket bookings were $1.79 billion, or 52% of total bookings, down 11.7%, or 10.9% on a constant currency basis       Sales were $3.73 billion, down 5.4%, or 4.9% on a constant currency basis   Original equipment sales were $1.90 billion, down 3.1%, or 2.9% on a constant currency basis   Aftermarket sales were $1.83 billion, down 7.6%, or 6.9% on a constant currency basis       Reported gross and operating margins of 30.0% and 6.7%, respectively   Adjusted gross and operating margins3 were 31.2% and 9.8%, respectively     

 “In a challenging market environment, we delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter including meaningful working capital improvements and free cash flow of $185 million. Additionally, our associates continued to operate safely and efficiently throughout the pandemic to meet the needs of our customers, while also delivering meaningful progress on our transformation program,” said Scott Rowe, Flowserve’s president and chief executive officer. “In light of the ongoing COVID-induced market headwinds over the past year, we accelerated our Flowserve 2.0 transformation cost reduction initiatives and took over $100 million of costs out of the business during 2020. This swift and decisive action and our ongoing operational performance enabled us to limit decremental adjusted operating margins to only 14 percent in the fourth quarter.”  

 “In 2021 we are returning our focus to the growth and optimization aspects of the Flowserve 2.0 agenda,” added Rowe. “Innovation and new product development are key aspects of our growth strategy, and we expect to build upon the momentum we achieved in 2020, which included 21 commercial launches of new, redesigned or upgraded products. Additionally, this year we further differentiated our product offering by commercializing RedRaven, Flowserve’s IoT offering to optimize our customers’ flow control processes and lower their operating costs.”  

 2021 Guidance4  

 Flowserve is providing Reported and Adjusted EPS guidance for 2021, as well as certain other financial metrics, as shown in the table below.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Flowserve’s 2021 Adjusted EPS target range excludes expected realignment charges of approximately $25 million, as well as the potential impact of below-the-line foreign currency effects and certain other discrete items. In a change of our approach in 2021, Flowserve 2.0 transformation-related expenses of approximately 5 cents per share will now be included in both our reported and adjusted EPS. Additionally, both the Reported and the Adjusted EPS target range includes the expected revenue decrease of approximately 4.0 to 7.0 percent year-over-year, and is based on current foreign currency rates and commodity prices, 2020 year-end backlog, expected bookings levels and market conditions, the reset of annual incentive performance goals, a broad-based merit increase, modest above-the-line foreign currency benefit, net interest expense in the range of $55 to $60 million and an adjusted tax rate of 22 to 24 percent. The quarterly phasing of expected 2021 earnings is anticipated in-line with Flowserve’s traditional seasonality.  

 Comment on Outlook  

 Rowe concluded, “The impact of the COVID-driven downturn impacted our financial performance in 2020, but due to our late-cycle nature, it will have a larger impact to our business in 2021 given our lower starting backlog and the ongoing management of the pandemic across our global footprint. However, I am increasingly optimistic, as the pandemic gets further contained, that our end markets will be well-positioned for significant growth.”  

 “We are encouraged by the progress of the vaccines, increased global mobility, stability in commodity prices, and the pent-up demand for our parts and services to existing infrastructure. Since we cannot accurately predict the timing of the inflection, our guidance only reflects modest end-market improvement. We do believe, assuming progress continues against the pandemic, that we will return to bookings growth this calendar year which would position us for improved financial performance in 2022.”

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain non-recurring items present additional useful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods, providing investors with a clearer view of the underlying trends of the business. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, planning and compensation decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Throughout our materials we refer to non-GAAP measures as “Adjusted.” Non-GAAP financial measures, which may be inconsistent with similarly captioned measures presented by other companies, should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
