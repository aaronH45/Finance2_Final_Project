On February 26, 2021, the Board of Directors of Phillips 66 (the “Company”) appointed Mark E. Lashier to serve as President and Chief Operating Officer, effective April 1, 2021. 

Mr. Lashier, 59, has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (“CPChem”), a global petrochemical joint venture in which the Company owns a 50% interest, since 2017. Mr. Lashier joined CPChem in 2000 and has held numerous positions of increasing responsibility, including the Asia Region Manager; Senior Vice President, Specialties, Aromatics, & Styrenics; and Executive Vice President, Olefins and Polyolefins. Mr. Lashier holds a bachelor’s degree and doctorate in chemical engineering from Iowa State University. 

In connection with Mr. Lashier’s appointment as the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer, he will be entitled to receive an annual base salary of $1,100,000. Mr. Lashier will be eligible to participate in the Company’s variable incentive cash program (“VCIP”) with a target opportunity equal to 110% of his base salary. His actual VCIP payout, if any, will be based on performance relative to the performance goals established under the VCIP. Mr. Lashier’s long-term incentive grant value for 2021 will be $6,050,000, or 550% of his base salary, 50% of which will be performance shares, 25% of which will be stock options and 25% of which will be restricted stock units. Mr. Lashier will also receive a one-time grant of restricted stock units with a grant date value of $1,000,000 which will vest in two equal installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to his continued employment through the applicable vesting dates. This one-time grant is intended to compensate Mr. Lashier for certain compensation from CPChem that will be forfeited as a result of his departure.

Mr. Lashier will also be eligible to participate in the Company’s other benefit plans and programs generally available to executive officers of the Company, such as health insurance, income protection in a circumstance of disability, and retirement and severance benefits plans, descriptions of which are included in the Company’s Definitive Proxy Statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, filed on Schedule 14A with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2020.

Other than with respect to the compensation matters described above, there are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Lashier and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Lashier was appointed the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer. There are also no family relationships between Mr. Lashier and any director or executive officer of the Company. Mr. Lashier has no direct or indirect interest in any transaction or proposed transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
