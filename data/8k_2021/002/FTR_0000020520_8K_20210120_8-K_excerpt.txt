 Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure.    

As previously disclosed, on April 14, 2020, Frontier Communications Corporation (the “Company”) and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 (the ”Chapter 11 Cases”) of title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). 

On January 20, 2021, the Company filed a monthly operating report with the Bankruptcy Court for the period from December 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 (the “Monthly Operating Report”), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (“Current Report”) and is incorporated by reference herein. This Current Report (including exhibits hereto) will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely by Regulation FD. The Monthly Operating Reports and other filings with the Bankruptcy Court related to the Chapter 11 Cases may be available electronically at https://cases.primeclerk.com/ftr. 

The information being furnished under this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, of this Current Report shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ”Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. 

Cautionary Statement Concerning the Monthly Operating Report and Forward-Looking Statements 

The Company cautions investors and potential investors not to place undue reliance upon the information contained in the Monthly Operating Report, which was not prepared for the purpose of providing the basis for an investment decision relating to any of the securities of the Company. The Monthly Operating Report is limited in scope, covers a limited time period and has been prepared solely for the purpose of complying with the monthly reporting requirements of the Bankruptcy Court. The Monthly Operating Report was not audited or reviewed by independent accountants, was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, is in a format prescribed by applicable bankruptcy laws or rules, and is subject to future adjustment and reconciliation. There can be no assurance that, from the perspective of an investor or potential investor in the Company’s securities, the Monthly Operating Report is complete. The Monthly Operating Report also contains information for periods which are shorter or otherwise different from those required in the Company’s reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, and such information might not be indicative of the Company’s financial conditions or operating results for the period that would be reflected in the Company’s financial statements or in its reports pursuant to the Exchange Act. Results set forth in the Monthly Operating Report should not be viewed as indicative of future results. 

Furthermore, this Current Report and the exhibit hereto may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this filing that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes, targets or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements and are based on management’s current expectations, beliefs, assumptions and estimates. The Company’s actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of the risk factors and cautionary language described from time to time in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Company’s Current Reports on Form 8-K, including those risk factors associated with the Chapter 11 Cases. The Company has no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements and does not undertake to do so.
