UNDER ARMOUR REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2020 RESULTS; PROVIDES INITIAL 2021 OUTLOOK

BALTIMORE, Feb. 10, 2021 – Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE: UA, UAA) today announced unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The company reports its financial performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). This press release refers to “currency neutral” and “adjusted” amounts, which are non-GAAP financial measures described below under the “Non-GAAP Financial Information” paragraph. References to adjusted financial measures exclude the impact of the company’s 2020 restructuring plan and related impairment charges, impairments associated with certain long-lived assets and goodwill and related tax effects, and with respect to certain measures, the non-cash amortization of debt discount on the company’s convertible debt, deal-costs and gain associated with the sale of MyFitnessPal and related tax effects. The reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to GAAP is presented in supplemental financial information furnished with this release. All per share amounts are reported on a diluted basis.

“Improving brand strength and consistent operational execution delivered better than expected results in the fourth quarter,” said Under Armour President and CEO Patrik Frisk. “Our global team was exceptionally resilient and disciplined amid a highly challenging year which included the COVID-19 pandemic and for Under Armour, a comprehensive restructuring effort including further operating model refinements.” 

Frisk concluded, “As we continue to navigate uncertainty around the pandemic, we remain focused on execution and the efforts necessary to stabilize our business further and improve our ability to deliver sustainable shareholder value over the long-term.”

2020 Restructuring Plan

The company previously announced a $550 million to $600 million restructuring plan designed to rebalance its cost base to improve profitability and cash flow. The company recognized $473 million of pre-tax charges for the full year, including $62 million in the fourth quarter. Of the $473 million recognized, there were $125 million in cash related charges and $348 million in non-cash related charges. As previously disclosed, the company anticipates recognizing additional charges related to this plan in the first half of 2021. 

Initial 2021 Outlook

Based on current visibility, including ongoing impacts related to COVID-19, key points related to Under Armour’s full-year 2021 outlook include:

•Revenue is expected to be up at a high-single-digit percentage rate, reflecting a high single-digit growth rate in North America and a high-teens growth rate in the international business. 

•Gross margin is expected to be up slightly versus the prior year adjusted gross margin rate of 48.6 with benefits from pricing and supply chain efficiency, being largely offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal, which was a high gross margin business. 

•Operating income is expected to reach $5 million to $25 million. Excluding the impact of continued restructuring efforts, adjusted operating income is expected to reach $130 million to $150 million. 

•Diluted loss per share is expected to be about $0.18 to $0.20 and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.14.

However, due to ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its potential effect on global markets, there could be other material impacts on the company’s full-year business results in 2021.

COVID-19 Update

As Under Armour continues to monitor the potential global impacts of COVID-19, the company remains focused on protecting its teammates’ and consumers’ health and safety while working with its suppliers, partners, and customers to minimize potential disruptions. In compliance with public health authorities and guidance from government entities, Under Armour will continue to modify its business practices to help moderate the spread of COVID-19. These adaptations may include reduced capacity and temporary closing of retail locations, distribution centers and offices; observing travel restrictions; employing social distancing and safety measures; and obeying quarantine requirements.

The following provides additional information on Under Armour’s state of operations as of January 31, 2021: 

•The majority of the company’s supply chain and distribution network was operational.

•The majority of global locations (direct-to-consumer and mono-branded partner stores) where Under Armour is sold were open; however, not all are operating at full capacity due to various restrictions. By region:

–Approximately 95 percent of North American stores were open.

–Approximately 70 percent of EMEA stores were open.

–Approximately 95 percent of Asia-Pacific stores were open.

–Approximately 70 percent of Latin American stores were open.

•Globally, while traffic trends within the company’s owned retail locations remain challenged, conversion trends remain strong. Additionally, the company experienced significant eCommerce growth around the world during the fourth quarter and full-year 2020.

As uncertainty related to COVID-19 persists, Under Armour expects ongoing disruption to its business operations, potentially materially impacting results.

Completed Sale of MyFitnessPal Platform

As previously announced on December 18, 2020, Under Armour completed the sale of the MyFitnessPal business to Francisco Partners for $345 million, inclusive of the achievement of potential earn-out payments.

Fiscal Year End Change

Under Armour’s Board of Directors has authorized a change in its fiscal year-end from December 31 to March 31, effective for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2022. Given Under Armour’s largest quarters are currently realized in the July 1 through December 31 period, the company believes that this change will provide greater alignment with our business cycle and financial reporting. There will be no change to fiscal 2021, which is expected to be reported in February of 2022. Following a three month-transition period (January 1 – March 31, 2022), Under Armour’s fiscal 2023 will run from April 1, 2022, through March 31, 2023. Consequently, there will be no fiscal 2022. 

Conference Call and Webcast

Under Armour will hold its fourth quarter and full year conference call and webcast today at approximately 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The call will be webcast live at https://about.underarmour.com/investor-relations/financials and will be archived and available for replay about three hours after the live event. 

Non-GAAP Financial Information

This press release refers to “currency neutral” and “adjusted” results as well as “adjusted” forward-looking estimates of the company’s fiscal 2021 outlook. Currency neutral financial information is calculated to exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes this information is useful to investors to compare the company’s results of operations period-over-period. Adjusted financial measures exclude the impact of the company’s 2020 restructuring plan and related impairment charges, impairments associated with certain long-lived assets and goodwill, and related tax effects. Management believes this information is useful to investors because it enhances visibility into its actual underlying results, excluding these impacts. Adjusted interest expense, adjusted other expense, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share also exclude the non-cash amortization of debt discount on the company’s convertible senior notes, the deal costs and gain recognized in connection with the company’s sale of MyFitnessPal and related tax effects. Management believes the non-cash portion of the interest expense, which represents the accretion of the bifurcated equity component of the convertible senior notes’ conversion option, is not core to the company’s operations given the intent and ability to settle in shares of the company’s Class C common stock. Similarly, deal costs and gain recognized in connection with the MyFitnessPal sale are not core to the company’s operations, given dispositions are infrequent and non-recurring. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation and should be contemplated in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company’s reported results prepared per GAAP. Additionally, the company’s non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE RECONCILIATION

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The estimated impact of restructuring plan presented above assumes approximately the high-end of the Company's estimated remaining range of restructuring and related charges, which is approximately $80 to $130 million.

In connection with the Company’s fourth quarter and full-year conference call and webcast, the Company will discuss its projected adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2021. As a result of its 2020 restructuring plan, the Company currently expects to record income tax expense on pre-tax losses for fiscal 2021. Therefore, the income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021, is subject to significant variability based on the actual quarterly pre-tax results, and a meaningful estimated range of GAAP-based income tax expense cannot be provided. The GAAP-based income tax expense for the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 could range from $2 million to $95 million based on facts and circumstances. Given this variability, there is substantial uncertainty associated with accurately projecting the Company’s GAAP-based income tax expense and GAAP-based diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Accordingly, a reconciliation to the Company’s adjusted diluted earnings per share has not been provided, as it believes the reconciliation is not meaningful. 

The Company’s net income for the three months ended March 31, 2021, is expected to be impacted by approximately $90 to $110 million of restructuring and related impairment charges, and approximately $5 million of non-cash amortization of debt discount on its convertible debt, both of which are excluded for purposes of calculating adjusted net income.
