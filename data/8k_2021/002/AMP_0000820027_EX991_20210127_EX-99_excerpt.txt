Minneapolis, MN January 27, 2021 Perspective from Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer “Ameriprise delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year despite a challenging environment. Across the firm, our teams are focused on serving clients’ needs and executing our key initiatives, which resulted in record growth in both client inflows and assets. “With our exceptional personal client experience and extensive digital capabilities, assets under management and administration grew to more than $1 trillion, another new record. This included very strong metrics in our primary growth businesses—Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. In total, we had nearly $15 billion in net inflows in the quarter, which was more than $7 billion above last year. “Our financial foundation and ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow helped us navigate market headwinds and continue both our growth investments and capital return to shareholders at a differentiated rate. In fact, in 2020, Ameriprise returned $1.8 billion to shareholders. “As we build on our momentum in 2021, we recognize the enormous challenges the pandemic has created for individuals, businesses and the economy. Ameriprise will continue to help clients stay on track to achieve their financial goals, and I feel very good about the opportunity before us.”

See reconciliation on page 13. Advice & Wealth Management pretax adjusted operating earnings were $352 million. Results were negatively impacted by $92 million from the reduction in short-term interest rates. Excluding the decline in short-term interest rates, adjusted operating earnings increased 19 percent driven by strong wrap net inflows and transactional activity, as well as continued expense management. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 19.8 percent, a 60-basis point sequential improvement. Adjusted operating net revenues were $1.8 billion. Excluding the decline in short-term interest rates, revenues increased 10 percent reflecting strong wrap net inflows and market appreciation. On a sequential basis, revenues increased 7 percent. Total expenses were $1.4 billion. General and administrative expense was well managed and increased 2 percent. Excluding the bank, general and administrative expenses increased 1 percent, which was in line with expectations as planned investments for future growth were largely offset by expense reengineering. Total client assets grew 14 percent to $732 billion. The company’s ability to meet client needs efficiently and effectively is translating into excellent organic growth. Advisor productivity remains high with growth in the investment advisory business and improved transactional activity. Wrap flows in the quarter reached a record high at $7.9 billion, nearly double a year ago, and transactional activity increased 5 percent. Cash balances remain elevated at $41.5 billion with a substantial opportunity for clients to put cash back to work in the future. Adjusted operating net revenue per advisor on a trailing 12-month basis was impacted by low interest rates and increased 2 percent to $674,000. Excluding the decline in short-term interest rates, adjusted net revenue per advisor increased 8 percent. Total advisors increased to 9,922, with strong advisor retention and experienced advisor recruiting. Experienced advisor recruiting was strong with 82 productive advisors added in the quarter.  

 4 Asset Management pretax adjusted operating earnings were $201 million, up 13 percent, driven by strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Net pretax adjusted operating margin was 39.5 percent. Adjusted operating revenues increased 4 percent to $798 million from the cumulative impact of improved flows and higher equity markets, that was partially offset by lower performance fee revenue. Performance fee revenue in the quarter was $17 million compared to $41 million a year ago. The overall fee rate remained strong at 52 basis points as higher-fee gross sales offset lower-fee redemptions. Adjusted operating expenses increased 1 percent. General and administrative expenses remain well managed, down 2 percent as planned investments for future growth were more than offset by expense reengineering. Expenses in the prior year period included elevated performance fee compensation. Total assets under management increased 11 percent reflecting higher equity markets and positive net inflows. Investment performance remained strong across equity, fixed income and multi-asset strategies. In the quarter, net inflows were $7.0 billion, which included $1.3 billion of former parent outflows. Excluding former parent outflows, net inflows were $8.3 billion, a $4.1 billion improvement year-over-year.  Retail net inflows were $7.7 billion, benefiting from $6.2 billion of reinvested dividends. Net inflows in North America were $7.1 billion with notable flows in the broker-dealer channel and improved net inflows in EMEA of $0.6 billion driven by positive flows across all platforms in Continental Europe that more than offset outflows in the U.K.  Global institutional net inflows were $0.5 billion, with gross sales across multiple regions and product offerings.

 5 Retirement & Protection Solutions pretax adjusted operating earnings increased $1 million to $180 million, from higher fees and higher ending market levels, partially offset by lower interest rates. Though the number of life insurance claims was elevated as a result of COVID-19, the financial impact was limited as a significant portion of mortality risk is reinsured. Sales of variable annuities increased 20 percent year-over-year to $1.3 billion. Retirement sales without living benefit guarantees more than doubled from a year ago and now represent 58 percent of variable annuity sales, driven by our recently launched, lower-risk structured product as well as our RAVA 5 product without living benefit guarantees. This sales trend is expected to continue and meaningfully shift the mix of the business over time to lower-risk products that do not have living benefit guarantees. Annuity net amount at risk as a percent of account values was 0.4 percent for living benefits and 0.1 percent for death benefits, which management believes is one of the lowest among major variable annuity writers, reflecting the high quality of the book. Sales of protection products declined 4 percent from a year ago with a product mix shift that is consistent with our focused approach. Sales of higher-margin accumulation VUL products nearly doubled and sales shifted away from indexed UL products as expected given pricing changes that reflect the low interest rate environment.
