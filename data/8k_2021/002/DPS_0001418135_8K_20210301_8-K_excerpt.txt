Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On March 1, 2021, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (“KDP” or the “Company”) filed a prospectus supplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which the Company may offer and sell up to 4,300,000 shares (the “Securities”) of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, from time to time to or through Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman”), as sales agent, in at-the-market offerings (the “ATM Program”). The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Securities under the ATM Program primarily to cover its obligation to remit cash to local, state and federal tax authorities in connection with the net settlement of vesting restricted stock units, with any remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. Use of the ATM Program to fund these tax withholding obligations is intended to create an orderly market in KDP shares being sold to cover tax obligations on behalf of employees upon the vesting of equity awards in 2021.  

In connection with the ATM Program, on March 1, 2021, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “Agreement”) with Goldman. The offering of the Securities pursuant to the Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all shares of common stock subject to the Agreement, or (ii) termination of the Agreement by us or by Goldman as provided therein. The Agreement contains customary representations, covenants and indemnification provisions.  

Securities sold under the Agreement, if any, will be offered, issued and sold pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-233477 and 333-233506), including the prospectus, dated August 27, 2019 (the “Registration Statement”), and the prospectus supplement, dated March 1, 2021, as the same may be amended or supplemented.  

The foregoing summary of the Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete text of the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The legal opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP relating to the legality of the Securities is filed as Exhibit 5.1 hereto, and is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.  

This Current Report on Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy shares of common stock and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
