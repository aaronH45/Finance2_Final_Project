Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On February 16, 2021, FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy or the Company) issued two public documents, which, among other things provide expected results for the year-ended December 31, 2020, and announce plans to introduce GAAP and Operating (non-GAAP) earnings guidance for the full-year 2021. FirstEnergy’s Press Release and Letter to the Investment Community, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, hereto and incorporated herein by reference, contain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G and Item 10(e)(i) of Regulation S-K, FirstEnergy has provided reconciliations within the Press Release and Letter to the Investment Community of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The information set forth in and incorporated into this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any of the Company’s filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, whether made before or after the date hereof and regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings, except to the extent expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

The attached Press Release and Letter to the Investment Community contain references to the non-GAAP financial measure Operating earnings (loss) per share. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Operating earnings (loss) per share are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to the extent they exclude the impact of “special items.” Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company’s ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures such as Operating earnings (loss) per share to evaluate the Company’s performance and manage its operations and frequently references this non-GAAP financial measure in its decision-making, using it to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of Operating earnings (loss) per share provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measure is useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the Company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the Company’s peer group. This non-GAAP financial measure is intended to complement, and is not considered an alternative to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Also, the non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

On February 16, 2021, the Company issued a Press Release and Letter to the Investment Community announcing its Ohio utilities, the Ohio Edison Company, The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company and The Toledo Edison Company (the Ohio Companies), will not seek recovery of lost distribution revenue from residential and commercial customers authorized under their current Electric Security Plan (ESP) through May 31, 2024. A copy of the Press Release and Letter to the Investment Community are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are in incorporated herein by reference. 

The information set forth in and incorporated into this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any of the Company’s filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, whether made before or after the date hereof and regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings, except to the extent expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. The filing of this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information herein that is required to be disclosed solely by reason of Regulation FD.

Item 8.01 Other Events.

You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in FirstEnergy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020, which could materially affect FirstEnergy’s business, financial condition or future results. The risk factor presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in FirstEnergy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020.

We Have Received Requests for Information Related to Government Investigations. Related Potential Adverse Impacts on Federal or State Regulatory Matters Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on our Reputation, Business, Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Liquidity or Cash Flows

On July 21, 2020, we received subpoenas for records from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the S.D. Ohio requesting the production of information concerning an investigation surrounding Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6) involving the now former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and other individuals and entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Householder. On January 26, 2021, staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Division of Investigations issued a letter directing FirstEnergy to preserve and maintain all documents and information related to an ongoing audit being conducted by FERC’s Division of Audits and Accounting, including activities relating to lobbying and governmental affairs activities concerning HB 6. We are cooperating with the FERC in the ongoing audit and document preservation request. 

We are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence our operating environment. As previously disclosed, among the matters considered with respect to the determination by the committee of independent members of the Board of Directors to terminate certain former members of senior management for violating certain FirstEnergy policies and its code of conduct related to a payment of approximately $4 million made in early 2019 in connection with the termination of a purported consulting agreement, as amended, which had been in place since 2013. The counterparty to such agreement was an entity associated with an individual who subsequently was appointed to a full-time role as an Ohio government official directly involved in regulating the Ohio Companies, including with respect to distribution rates. FirstEnergy believes that payments under the consulting agreement may have been for purposes other than those represented within the consulting agreement. The matter is a subject of the ongoing internal investigation related to the government investigations.

Any appearance of non-compliance with anti-corruption laws, as well as any alleged failures to comply with anti-corruption laws, could have an adverse impact on our reputation or relationships with regulatory authorities, and result in a material inquiry or investigation by such federal, state and local regulatory agencies, and result in adverse rulings against us, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and operations. 

For example, there are several regulatory matters associated with the ongoing governmental investigations including, but not limited to, the following:

•On September 15, 2020, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) opened a new proceeding to review the political and charitable spending by the Ohio Companies in support of HB 6 and the subsequent referendum effort, directing the Ohio Companies to show cause, demonstrating that the costs of any political or charitable spending in support of HB 6, or the subsequent referendum effort, were not included, directly or indirectly, in any rates or charges paid by ratepayers.

•On November 4, 2020, the PUCO initiated an additional corporate separation audit as a result of the termination of certain members of senior management. 

•On December 30, 2020, the PUCO reinstated the requirement that the Ohio Companies file a distribution rate case by May 31, 2024, which requirement had previously been eliminated by the PUCO in November 2019.

•Also, on December 30, 2020, the PUCO reopened the Distribution Modernization Rider (DMR) audit docket, and directed the PUCO Staff to solicit a third-party auditor and conduct a full review of the DMR to ensure funds collected from ratepayers through the DMR were only used for the purposes established in ESP.

•On January 26, 2021, staff of FERC's Division of Investigations issued a letter directing FirstEnergy to preserve and maintain all documents and information related to an ongoing audit being conducted by FERC's Division of Audits and Accounting, including activities related to lobbying and governmental affairs activities concerning HB 6.

•In connection with the partial settlement with the Ohio Attorney General and other parties, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO on February 1, 2021, to set the respective decoupling riders (Rider CSR) to zero and, in a related action, the Ohio Companies will not seek to recover lost distribution revenue from residential and commercial customers; as a result, FirstEnergy recognized a $108 million pre-tax charge ($84 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2020, and $77 million (pre-tax) of which is associated with forgoing collection of lost distribution revenue. 

We are unable to predict the adverse impacts on federal or state regulatory matters, including with respect to rates, and, therefore, any of these risks could impact us significantly beyond expectations. Moreover, we are unable to predict the potential for any additional regulatory actions, any of which could exacerbate these risks or expose us to adverse outcomes in pending or future rate cases, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.
