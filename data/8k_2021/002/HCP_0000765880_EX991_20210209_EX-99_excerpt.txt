FULL YEAR COMPARISON

NAREIT FFO, FFO as Adjusted, AFFO, Same-Store Cash NOI, Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDAre are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful in evaluating the operating performance and financial position of real estate investment trusts (see the "Funds From Operations" and "Adjusted Funds From Operations" sections of this release for additional information). See "December 31, 2020 Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definitions, discussions of their uses and inherent limitations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://ir.healthpeak.com/quarterly-results. 

REPORTING UPDATES

Healthpeak made the following reporting updates:

▪During 2020, Healthpeak established and began executing a strategy to dispose of its senior housing triple-net and SHOP assets. As noted above, many of those dispositions have already occurred and the remainder are in process for 2021. At December 31, 2020, Healthpeak evaluated the criteria in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and concluded that the operating results related to its senior housing triple-net and SHOP assets should be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, comparative periods have been recast to reflect the operating results related to these assets as discontinued operations.

▪Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, Healthpeak reports operating results from (i) its small hospital portfolio in the medical office segment, and (ii) its remaining unconsolidated SWF SH JV in other the non-reportable segment. Metrics reported for comparative periods have been recast to conform with the current period presentation.

_______________________________________ 

(1)For the year ended December 31, 2020, includes a $170 million gain upon consolidation of 13 continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs") in which we acquired Brookdale's interest and began consolidating during the first quarter of 2020. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, includes a $161 million gain upon deconsolidation of 19 previously consolidated senior housing assets that were contributed into a new, unconsolidated joint venture. Gains and losses upon change of control are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

(2)For the year ended December 31, 2020, includes the termination fee and transition fee expenses related to terminating the management agreements with Brookdale for 13 CCRCs and transitioning those communities to LCS, partially offset by the tax benefit recognized related to those expenses. The expenses related to terminating management agreements are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 

(3)For the three months and year ended December 31, 2020, includes reserves for loan losses under the current expected credit losses accounting standard in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses ("ASC 326"). The year ended December 31, 2020 also includes a gain on sale of a hospital that was in a direct financing lease ("DFL") and the impairment of an undeveloped MOB land parcel, which was sold during the third quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2019, represents the impairment of 13 senior housing triple-net facilities under DFLs recognized as a result of entering into sales agreements.

(4)For the year ended December 31, 2020, represents the valuation allowance and corresponding income tax expense related to deferred tax assets that are no longer expected to be realized as a result of our plan to dispose of our SHOP portfolio. We determined we were unlikely to hold the assets long enough to realize the future value of certain deferred tax assets generated by the net operating losses of our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

(5)For the year ended December 31, 2020, represents the tax benefit from the CARES Act, which extended the net operating loss carryback period to five years.

 _______________________________________ 

(1)In connection with the acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the CCRC JV in January 2020, we consolidated the 13 communities in the CCRC JV and recorded the assets and liabilities at their acquisition date relative fair values, including the CCRC contract liabilities associated with previously collected non-refundable entrance fees. In conjunction with increasing those CCRC contract liabilities to their fair value, we concluded that we will no longer adjust for the timing difference between non-refundable entrance fees collected and amortized as we believe the amortization of these fees is a meaningful representation of how we satisfy the performance obligations of the fees. As such, upon consolidation of the CCRC assets, we no longer exclude the difference between CCRC entrance fees collected and amortized from the calculation of AFFO. For comparative periods presented, the adjustment continues to represent our 49% share of non-refundable entrance fees collected by the CCRC JV, net of reserves and net of CCRC JV entrance fee amortization.

(2)Primarily includes our share of AFFO capital expenditures from unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by noncontrolling interests' share of AFFO capital expenditures from consolidated joint ventures. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2020, includes an increase to insurance claims that have been incurred but not yet reported on the 13 CCRCs in which we acquired Brookdale's interest and began consolidating during the first quarter of 2020 and senior housing triple-net assets that transitioned to RIDEA structures during the year.
