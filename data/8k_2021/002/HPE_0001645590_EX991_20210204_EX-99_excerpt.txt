(a) Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company ("the Company") implemented certain organizational changes to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. These organizational changes are: (i) the transfer of the lifecycle event services business, previously reported within the Advisory and Professional Services ("A & PS") reportable segment to Compute, Storage and HPC & MCS reportable segments; (ii) the transfer of certain software and related services business, previously reported within the Compute, Storage and A & PS reportable segments to the Corporate Investments and Other reportable segment, to form a new Software operating segment; and (iii) the transfer of remaining A & PS operating segment, previously reported as a separate reportable segment, to the Corporate Investments and Other reportable segment. As a result of these changes, the Corporate Investments and Other Segment now includes the A & PS operating segment, the Communications and Media Solutions operating segment, the Software operating segment, and the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Labs which is responsible for research and development. 

The Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the fiscal 2019 and 2020 financial results, which primarily resulted in the transfer of net revenue and operating profit for each of the businesses as described above. These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated results.

(b) Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense from its segment earnings from operations results and excluded stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results. The Company has reflected this change retrospectively to the fiscal 2019 and 2020 financial results. This change had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated GAAP results. However, the Company reflected the change resulting from the reclassification of its stock-based compensation expense by restating its consolidated non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from operations, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP net earnings per share. Each restated non-GAAP measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure herein.
