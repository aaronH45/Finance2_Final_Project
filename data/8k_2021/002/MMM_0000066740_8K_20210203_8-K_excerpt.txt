Item 8.01. Other Events 

Kristen Ludgate, Senior Vice President, Human Resources, adopted a prearranged trading plan on February 3, 2021, in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and with 3M Company’s policies regarding transactions in 3M securities by insiders. 

Rule 10b5-1 plans permit insiders to sell a specified portion of their holdings at a specified time or over a specified period of time pursuant to a written plan established at a time when the insider is not in possession of material non-public information. A Rule 10b5-1 plan offers an opportunity for an insider to provide for future transactions without concern about unforeseen future events that may be considered material non-public information at the time those transactions occur. A Rule 10b5-1 plan may, for example, allow an insider to diversify his or her investment portfolio by selling Company shares from time to time over a pre-established period of time, without regard for future developments relating to the Company. 

Ms. Ludgate’s plan contemplates the sale of up to 933 shares of 3M common stock that constitute fully vested shares from restricted stock previously granted to her under a 3M equity compensation plan and shares she purchased pursuant to 3M’s general employees stock purchase plan. Shares will be sold under the plan only if the stock price is at or above a minimum price specified in the plan. All transactions under the plan, if they occur, are expected to be completed by September 30, 2021. At the end of that date, the plan will terminate and if any shares remain unsold, they will not be sold pursuant to this plan. Ms. Ludgate is and, assuming execution of the transactions contemplated by the plan, would remain above the minimum stock ownership thresholds established by the Company for its executive officers. Any transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly on Form 4 and, if applicable, in a Form 144, in each case as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
