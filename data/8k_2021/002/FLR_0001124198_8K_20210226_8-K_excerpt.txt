 Item 2.02Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 

On February 26, 2021, Fluor Corporation (the “Company”) announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020. A copy of the press release (the “Earnings Release”) making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. 

The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liabilities of that section.

The Company includes backlog and new awards data in the Earnings Release. Backlog is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations, deferrals or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and project deferrals, as appropriate. New awards measure the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded in the period. Backlog and new awards measures are regularly reported in the construction industry.
