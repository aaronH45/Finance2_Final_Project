Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On February 18, 2021, FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy or Company) issued two public documents which, among other things: provide results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020; provide a GAAP forecast and operating (non-GAAP) earnings guidance for both the full-year and first quarter of 2021. FirstEnergy’s Press Release and 4Q 2020 Strategic and Financial Highlights, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, hereto and incorporated herein by reference, contain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G and Item 10(e)(i) of Regulation S-K, FirstEnergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Press Release and 4Q 2020 Strategic and Financial Highlights of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The information set forth in and incorporated into this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any of the Company’s filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, whether made before or after the date hereof and regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings, except to the extent expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

The attached Press Release and 4Q 2020 Strategic and Financial Highlights contain references to non-GAAP financial measures including, among others, Operating earnings (loss); Operating earnings (loss) per share; Operating earnings (loss) per share on a segment basis. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Operating earnings (loss), Operating earnings (loss) per share and Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to the extent they exclude the impact of “special items.” Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company’s ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. The Company’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these items in the context of Operating earnings (loss) per share growth projections because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. Operating earnings (loss) per share and Operating earnings (loss) per share for each segment is calculated by dividing Operating earnings (loss), which excludes specials items as discussed herein, for the periods presented in the fourth quarter of 2020 by 543 million shares, 542 million shares for the full-year of 2020, 540 million shares for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 539 million shares for the full-year of 2019, which reflects the full impact of share dilution from the equity issuance in January 2018. Basic EPS (GAAP) is based on 543 million shares for fourth quarter of 2020 and 542 million shares for the full-year 2020, and 540 million and 535 million shares for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019, respectively. Basic EPS (GAAP and non-GAAP) is based on 544 million shares for the first quarter and full-year 2021. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures such as Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share to evaluate the Company’s performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Additionally, management uses Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment to further evaluate FirstEnergy’s performance by segment and references this non-GAAP financial measure in its decision-making. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Operating earnings (loss), Operating earnings (loss) per share and Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measures are useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the Company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the Company’s peer group. All of these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to complement, and are not considered as alternatives to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.

FirstEnergy expressly disclaims any current intention to update or revise, except as required by law, any forward-looking
