Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an

On February 4, 2021, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (“Houston Electric”), CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (“CERC”) and Vectren Utility Holdings, Inc. (“VUHI”), replaced their existing revolving credit facilities with four revolving credit facilities totaling $4.0 billion in commitments. There were no termination penalties incurred by any of the Company, Houston Electric, CERC or VUHI in connection with the termination of the previous facilities.  

CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Credit Facility. The Company replaced its existing $3.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was previously entered into on March 3, 2016 (as amended) with a new $2.4 billion three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate equal to either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a specified margin (which is currently 162.5 basis points) based on the Company’s current credit ratings or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus a specified margin (which is currently 62.5 basis points) based on the Company’s current credit ratings. The Company may (i) extend, on up to two occasions, the scheduled maturity thereof for successive 

one-year periods, subject to, among other terms and conditions, the consent of the banks thereunder holding greater than 50% of the commitments then outstanding and (ii) request increases in the aggregate commitments thereunder to an amount not to exceed $3.0 billion, subject to certain terms and conditions. The facility contains certain covenants, including a covenant that requires the Company not to exceed a ratio of debt (excluding, among other things, transition and system restoration bonds) to consolidated capitalization (excluding, among other things, 

non-cash reductions to net income) of 65%. The credit facility provides a temporary increase of the permitted ratio under this covenant to 70% if Houston Electric experiences certain damages from a natural disaster in its service territory and the Company certifies to the administrative agent that the system restoration costs incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with that natural disaster are reasonably likely to exceed $100 million in a consecutive twelve-month period, all or part of which the Company or one of its subsidiaries intend to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial ratio covenant would be in effect from the date the Company delivers its certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of such certification or (iii) the revocation by the Company of such certification.  

CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC Credit Facility. Houston Electric replaced its existing $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was previously entered into on March 3, 2016 (as amended) with a new $300 million three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the facility bear interest, at Houston Electric’s option, at a rate equal to either (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin (which is currently 137.5 basis points) based on Houston Electric’s current credit ratings or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus a specified margin (which is currently 37.5 basis points) based on Houston Electric’s current credit ratings. Houston Electric may (i) extend, on up to two occasions, the scheduled maturity thereof for successive 

one-year periods, subject to, among other terms and conditions, the consent of the banks thereunder holding greater than 50% of the commitments then outstanding and (ii) request increases in the aggregate commitments thereunder to an amount not to exceed $450 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. The facility contains certain covenants, including a covenant that requires Houston Electric not to exceed a ratio of consolidated debt (excluding, among other things, transition and system restoration bonds) to consolidated capitalization (excluding, among other things, 

non-cash reductions to net income) of 67.5%. The credit facility provides a temporary increase of the permitted ratio under this covenant to 70% if Houston Electric experiences certain damages from a natural disaster in its service territory and Houston Electric certifies to the administrative agent that the system restoration costs incurred by Houston Electric and its subsidiaries in connection with that natural disaster are reasonably likely to exceed $100 million in a consecutive twelve-month period, all or part of which Houston Electric or one of its subsidiaries intend to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial ratio covenant would be in effect from the date Houston Electric delivers its certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of such certification or (iii) the revocation by Houston Electric of such certification.      

CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. Credit Facility. CERC replaced its existing $900 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was previously entered into on March 3, 2016 (as amended) with a new $900 million three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the facility bear interest, at CERC’s option, at a rate equal to either (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin (which is currently 125 basis points) based on CERC’s current credit ratings or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), plus a specified margin (which is currently 25 basis points) based on CERC’s current credit ratings. CERC may (i) extend, on up to two occasions, the scheduled maturity thereof for successive 

one-year periods, subject to, among other terms and conditions, the consent of the banks thereunder holding greater than 50% of the commitments then outstanding and (ii) request increases in the aggregate commitments thereunder to an amount not to exceed $1.375 billion, subject to certain terms and conditions. The facility contains certain covenants, including a covenant that that requires CERC not to exceed a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (excluding, among other things, 

non-cash reductions to net income) of 65%.  

Vectren Utility Holdings, Inc. Credit Facility. VUHI replaced its existing $400 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was previously entered into on July 14, 2017 with a new $400 million three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The facility is guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiaries, Indiana Gas Company, Inc., Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company and Vectren Energy Delivery of Ohio, Inc. Borrowings under the facility bear interest, at VUHI’s option, at a rate equal to either (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin (which is currently 125 basis points) based on VUHI’s current credit ratings or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), plus a specified margin (which is currently 25 basis points) based on VUHI’s current credit ratings. VUHI may (i) extend, on up to two occasions, the scheduled maturity thereof for successive 

one-year periods, subject to, among other terms and conditions, the consent of the banks thereunder holding greater than 50% of the commitments then outstanding and (ii) request increases in the aggregate commitments thereunder to an amount not to exceed $600 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. The facility contains certain covenants, including a covenant that that requires VUHI not to exceed a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (excluding, among other things, 

non-cash reductions to net income) of 65%.  

General. Borrowings under each of the committed facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that the Company, Houston Electric, CERC or VUHI make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that the Company, Houston Electric, CERC and VUHI consider customary. The facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. Under each credit facility, the applicable margins over LIBOR and the Alternate Base Rate and the commitment fee fluctuate based on the applicable borrower’s senior unsecured long-term debt rating or its equivalent (or if such rating is discontinued or unavailable, corporate credit rating) at the time of borrowing. Each credit facility also contains provisions relating to the replacement of LIBOR.  

The global coordinators for the four replacement facilities are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and BofA Securities, Inc. who, together with Citibank, N.A., MUFG Bank, Ltd., RBC Capital Markets and Barclays Bank PLC, also served as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners for the facilities. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. continues to serve as the administrative agent for the Company’s facility; Mizuho Bank, Ltd. continues to serve as the administrative agent for Houston Electric’s facility; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association continues to serve as the administrative agent for CERC’s facility; and Bank of America, N.A. continues to serve as the administrative agent for VUHI’s facility. Affiliates of the lenders in both the previous facilities and the replacement facilities have performed depository and other banking, investment banking, trust, investment management and advisory services for the Company and its affiliates, including Houston Electric, CERC and VUHI from time to time for which they have received customary fees and expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for the Company and its affiliates in the ordinary course of their business.  

The credit agreements described above are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 to this report and are incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the credit agreements.    

Item 8.01.  

Other Events.     

In connection with the decrease in the aggregate commitments under the Company’s credit facility, the size of the Company’s commercial paper program will decrease to permit the issuance of commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.4 billion at any time outstanding (a decrease of $900 million). The size of CERC’s and VUHI’s commercial paper programs will remain unchanged.  

Any commercial paper notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. The information contained in this Current Report on Form 

8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy notes under any of the Company’s, CERC’s or VUHI’s commercial paper programs.
