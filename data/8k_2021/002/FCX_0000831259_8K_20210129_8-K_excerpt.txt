Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On January 29, 2021, Gerald J. Ford notified the Board of Directors of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) that he will retire as a director effective upon the expiration of his current term, which ends in connection with FCX’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders in June 2021. In light of his impending retirement, effective as of February 2, 2021 (the Effective Date), Mr. Ford has stepped down as non-executive Chairman and as Chair of the Governance Committee. Mr. Ford’s decision to retire was not the result of any disagreement with FCX.

As of the Effective Date, the Board appointed Richard C. Adkerson, as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Adkerson will also continue to lead the company as Chief Executive Officer. The independent directors of the Board have appointed Dustan E. McCoy as Lead Independent Director and Lydia H. Kennard as Chair of the Governance Committee. Fran Townsend will continue to Chair the Corporate Responsibility Committee, John Stephens will continue to Chair the Audit Committee and Dusty McCoy will continue to Chair the Compensation Committee.

Further, as of the Effective Date, the Board appointed Kathleen L. Quirk as President of FCX. Ms. Quirk will continue to serve as Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Quirk, age 57, has served as Chief Financial Officer since December 2003. Ms. Quirk previously served as Executive Vice President from March 2007 to February 2021, Treasurer from February 2000 to August 2018 and as Senior Vice President from December 2003 to March 2007. Ms. Quirk also serves on the Board of Directors of Vulcan Materials Company. 

On the Effective Date and in connection with their new appointments, the Compensation Committee approved adjustments to the compensation of Mr. Adkerson and Ms. Quirk. Mr. Adkerson’s annual base salary was increased from $1.6 million to $1.8 million and Ms. Quirk’s annual base salary was increased from $800,000 to $1 million. Mr. Adkerson and Ms. Quirk also participate in (1) an annual cash incentive plan with a target award of 1.5 times base salary, with actual payout ranging from 0% to 175% depending on performance measured against specified metrics and (2) long-term incentive plans targeting 69% of total direct compensation for Mr. Adkerson and 64% of total direct compensation for Ms. Quirk. Except as otherwise noted herein, Mr. Adkerson’s and Ms. Quirk’s employment and compensation arrangements are described in FCX’s Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 22, 2020. 

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

Adkerson as Chairman of the Board (see Exhibit 99.1) and (2) the reinstatement of common stock dividends and the adoption of a performance based payout policy (see Exhibit 99.2). Copies of the press releases are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 and are incorporated into this Item 7.01 by reference.

The information furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
