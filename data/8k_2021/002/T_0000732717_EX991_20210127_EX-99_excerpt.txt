COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT

Our Communications segment consists of our Mobility, Video, Broadband and Business Wireline business units. During the fourth quarter, to further accelerate our ability to innovate and execute in our fast-growing broadband and fiber business, we began operating our video business separately from our broadband and legacy telephony operations. We have recast our results for all prior periods to split the Entertainment Group into two separate business units, Video and Broadband, and remove video operations from Business Wireline, combining all video operations in Video.
