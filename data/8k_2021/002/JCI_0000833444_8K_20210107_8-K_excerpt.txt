Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

On January 7, 2021, Tyco Fire Products LP (“Tyco”) and Chemguard Inc. (“Chemguard”), each wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries of Johnson Controls International plc (the “Company”), agreed to settle a previously disclosed class action lawsuit (Joan & Richard Campbell v. Tyco Fire Products LP and Chemguard Inc., et al) filed in 2018 regarding PFAS associated with Tyco’s Fire Technology Center (“FTC”) property in Marinette, Wisconsin. 

The settlement provides that Tyco will pay up to $17.5 million to compensate Town of Peshtigo residents who live in the area affected by PFAS from the FTC. The $17.5 million settlement includes compensation for qualified property owners for the claimed loss of value to their real property caused by the presence of PFAS as well as compensation to individuals for claims related to PFAS exposure or personal injury. The Company does not expect the settlement to have an impact on its fiscal year 2021 earnings or cash flows.

The settlement does not affect or change Tyco’s ongoing efforts to remediate PFAS associated with the FTC, including Tyco’s commitment to fund a permanent drinking water solution in the Town of Peshtigo and to build systems to permanently clean up ground/surface water and soil. 

The settlement of this lawsuit represents resolution of a class action involving the only location in the country where Tyco and Chemguard blend and test firefighting foam, in contrast to the other cases in which Tyco and Chemguard are parties involving the use of fire-fighting foam products on military bases, airfields, and other locations where firefighting foam and PFAS-containing products made by many different manufacturers may have been used. In the large majority of these other cases, Tyco and Chemguard believe that they have a government contractor defense available to them which, if successful, would result in immunity from the claims related to such sites. For more information regarding the remaining litigation, please see note 22 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2020.

The settlement does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing by Tyco or Chemguard, and Tyco and Chemguard continue to believe that PFAS chemicals at the levels found in the community do not cause injuries to persons or property. The settlement is subject to approval by the federal court presiding over the lawsuit and other contingencies, and that process will take several months.
