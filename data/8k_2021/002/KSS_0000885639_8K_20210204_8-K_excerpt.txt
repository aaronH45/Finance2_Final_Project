See Item 2.02.  

The information in Items 2.02 and 7.01, including the exhibit attached hereto, is furnished solely pursuant to Items 2.02 and 7.01 of Form 8-K. Consequently, such information is not deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Further, the information in Items 2.02 and 7.01, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933. 

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 

This current report on Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding revenue growth and operating margin expansion. The Company intends forward-looking terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “anticipates,” “plans,” or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, risks described more fully in Item 1A in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in Item 1A of Part II in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 2, 2020, which are expressly incorporated herein by reference, and other factors as may periodically be described in the Company's filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements relate to the date initially made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update them. 

Preliminary Financial Results 

The financial results included in this current report on Form 8-K are preliminary, based upon the Company’s estimates and are subject to revision based upon its financial closing procedures and the completion of its financial statements. The preliminary financial results included herein have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company’s management. The Company believes that the preliminary financial data have been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting its best estimates and judgments. However, the Company’s auditors have not audited, reviewed or performed any procedures with respect to these results. The Company’s actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of the completion of its financial closing procedures, final adjustments and other developments arising between now and the time that its financial results for this period are finalized. As a result, investors should exercise caution relying on this information and should not draw any inferences from this information regarding financial or operating data not provided. These preliminary financial results are not meant to be a comprehensive statement of the Company’s financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and should not be viewed as a substitute for full financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company anticipates filing a more detailed press release regarding its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial results on a Current Report on Form 8-K on March 2, 2021 and filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021 shortly thereafter.
