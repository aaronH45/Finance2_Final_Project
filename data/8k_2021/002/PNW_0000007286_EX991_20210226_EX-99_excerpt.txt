E X A M P L E O F I N N O V A T I O N I N N I T I A T I V E Bringing the Residential Customer into the Advanced Economy 29 Initiatives • Award-winning program to promote installation of advanced smart thermostats – reduces demand during 3-8 pm peak load window • Super off-peak electric vehicle charging rate equivalent to ~30¢ per gallon gasoline Potential Impact Demand Savings During Peak Afternoon Window Today Future 100-150 MW 300-500 MW  

Customer Driven Initiatives Underway – A Few Examples 30 Take Charge AZ Customer Advisory Board • Pilot program to encourage electric vehicle adoption by installing charging stations • Expect to install more than 250 chargers through 2021 Energy Efficiency • Gathers direct insight from residential customers • Identify customer concerns to shape solutions • Demand response programs to reward shift of energy usage to lower-cost times – smart thermostats – residential battery systems – grid-interactive water heaters  

E X A M P L E O F I N N O V A T I O N I N N I T I A T I V E Pilot Project Exploring Hydrogen as Potential Solution for Long Duration Storage 31 Collaborators • Palo Verde nuclear plant and Idaho National Laboratory Pilot Program 2020-2023 • Examine long-term cost effectiveness of hydrogen production at utility scale Goal • Use of hydrogen for long term storage of energy 100% Plant Output Power to hydrogen - stored Power to grid Power to grid Power from storage to grid Possible Scenario for Palo Verde Nuclear Plant April Lower demand on grid August Peak demand Profile of Project  

Key Value Drivers Going Forward 32 Focus to Avoid Regulatory Lag: • Enhanced recovery mechanisms • Or more frequent rate case filings • 2019 Rate Case (decision expected mid-2021) – Seek regulatory approval for an adjustor mechanism to enable more timely recovery of clean investments • Execute contracts to own additional clean energy resources Next 6-12 months • Investment in utility-owned clean energy resources • Concurrent recovery for those resources • Financing needs to support investments • Continued customer and sales growth Longer Term Next 3-5 Years  

Outlook: Steady Growth in Rate Base 33 Plan to continue dividend growth1 Expect annual renewable additions of 300-500MW 2022-2030 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 APS Rate Base Growth (Year End) $10.3B ~6% Long-Term CAGR $12.9B 1 Future dividends are subject to declaration at Board of Directors’ discretion.
