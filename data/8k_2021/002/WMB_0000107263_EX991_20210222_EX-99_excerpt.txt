CEO Perspective

Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, made the following comments:

“Williams established all-time record results in 2020, demonstrating how durable our business can be against multiple headwinds faced by our industry including the COVID-19 pandemic, major customer bankruptcies and a 

1

highly active hurricane season, among other factors. We surpassed guidance midpoints in our key financial metrics and generated free cash flow, driven by strong operations with records for both gathered volumes and contracted transmission capacity. Looking ahead to 2021, we believe our continued operating efficiencies combined with a focus on safety performance and environmental stewardship positions Williams to generate long-term sustainable value. Our business strategy is centered on the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas and its ability to accelerate emissions reductions in a pragmatic and cost-effective way. In addition to implementing aggressive and actionable plans to reduce our own emissions by 2030, we are pursuing a broader clean energy strategy that leverages our best-in-class pipeline transportation and storage systems to integrate solar, renewable natural gas, hydrogen and other emerging opportunities.

“Over the past year, our employees have truly demonstrated our safety-driven culture by taking care to protect themselves and others during the pandemic while at the same time efficiently completing projects that deliver clean, affordable energy to key markets ahead of schedule. I am incredibly proud of the around-the-clock work of our employees and their unwavering focus on running one of the nation’s largest energy infrastructure networks with the high level of dependability that consumers have come to expect – reliability that was particularly evident on our gas transmission systems during the severe cold weather event that gripped much of the country last week. Our production supplies in the Northeast and along the Gulf Coast as well as our network of interconnections with other pipelines and strategic storage reserves ensured we were able to meet our commitments and deliver scheduled supplies with no issue. The resiliency of our natural gas network allows us to meet energy demand in the most cost-effective, reliable way possible and demonstrates the importance of natural gas in our country’s energy mix.”

GAAP Measures

•Fourth-quarter 2020 net income from continuing operations attributable to Williams declined slightly compared to the prior year as the benefits of significantly lower operating and administrative costs from cost-savings initiatives and a change in an employee benefit policy, and higher service revenues were more than offset by higher net impairment charges.

•Improved service revenues reflect growth from Transco and Northwest Pipeline expansion projects and the benefit of certain minimum volume commitment (MVC) revenue in the West, partially offset by lower non-cash deferred revenue recognition at Gulfstar One and the impact of 2020 hurricane-related shut-ins in the Gulf of Mexico. The higher net impairment charges include the 2020 impairments of the Northeast Supply Enhancement project and our investment in Rocky Mountain Midstream, partially offset by the 2019 impairment of the Constitution Pipeline project, net of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in that project.

•Full-year 2020 net income similarly benefited from significantly lower operating and administrative costs, including the absence of prior year severance charges and the benefit of a change in an employee benefit policy, while service revenues declined slightly as growth from our Northeast JV and pipeline expansion projects and the benefit of certain MVCs was more than offset by decreases in non-cash deferred revenue recognition at Gulfstar One and in the Barnett Shale, as well as the expiration of a Barnett Shale MVC in 2019.

•The year-over-year change was also significantly impacted by net impairment charges, reflecting 2020 impairments related to equity-method investments, goodwill, and certain assets which resulted in a total $1.54 billion pre-tax charge, of which $65 million was attributable to noncontrolling interests. The 2019 period included similar impairment charges totaling $650 million, of which $209 million was attributable to noncontrolling interests, along with a $122 million gain on the sale of our Jackalope investment. The provision for income taxes changed favorably by $256 million primarily due to the change in pre-tax earnings.

•Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased as compared to the same period of 2019 primarily due to net favorable changes in net working capital. The decrease for the full-year period was primarily due to working capital changes involving $284 million of rate refunds related to the settlement of Transco’s general rate case paid in July, net of approximately $95 million of that amount collected from January through June 2020. 

Non-GAAP Measures

•Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter improved over the prior year as increased service revenues from pipeline expansion projects, higher Northeast G&P JV EBITDA, and lower operating and administrative costs were partially offset by lower non-cash deferred revenue recognition at Gulfstar One and the impact of 2020 hurricane-related shut-ins in the Gulf of Mexico.

•Full-year Adjusted EBITDA improved driven by lower operating and administrative costs and higher contributions from our Northeast G&P investments, partially offset by the previously described slight decline in service revenues and lower commodity margins.

•Changes in Adjusted Income for the quarter and full-year periods were similarly driven by the changes in Adjusted EBITDA.

•The increase in fourth quarter 2020 DCF compared to the prior year is driven by the increase in adjusted EBITDA and an income tax refund received. The increase in full-year DCF is also driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower maintenance capital, partially offset by increased distributions to noncontrolling interests driven by our Northeast JV.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Transmission & Gulf of Mexico

•Fourth-quarter 2020 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower operating and administrative costs, partially offset by decreased service revenues from lower non-cash deferred revenue amortization at Gulfstar One and the impact of 2020 hurricane-related shut-ins, partially offset by Transco expansion projects placed in service.

•Full-year Modified and Adjusted EBITDA also benefited from lower operating and administrative costs, partially offset by similar decreases in service revenues.

•Modified EBITDA for the comparative periods benefited from the absence of both 2019 severance charges and the 2019 impairment of the Constitution Pipeline project, partially offset by the 2020 impairment of the Northeast Supply Enhancement project. Both comparative periods reflect the reversal of previously capitalized costs, while 2020 also benefited from a change in employee benefit policy. These items have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

Northeast G&P

•Fourth-quarter 2020 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA reflect lower operating and administrative costs and higher contributions from equity-method investments. Full-year 2020 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA also reflect lower operating and administrative costs and higher contributions from equity-method investments, as well as increased service revenues associated with higher volumes. The full-year revenue comparison also benefited from the additional ownership in Utica East Ohio Midstream following the March 2019 acquisition and contribution to our Northeast JV.

•Modified EBITDA for both periods includes our share of impairments at equity-method investees and the benefit of a 2020 change in employee benefit policy, while the full-year comparison reflects the absence of 2019 severance charges. These items are all excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

•Excluding Blue Racer volumes for fourth-quarter 2020 operating stats, Northeast G&P gross gathering volumes for fourth-quarter 2020, including 100% of operated equity-method investments, increased by 7% over the same period in 2019 and gross processing plant inlet volumes for fourth-quarter 2020 increased by 9% over the same period in 2019.

West

•The changes in fourth-quarter 2020 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA reflect higher service revenues associated with certain MVCs and higher rates partially offset by lower volumes, as well as reduced operating and administrative costs. The changes in full-year 2020 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA reflect decreases in non-cash deferred revenue recognition in the Barnett Shale, as well as the expiration of the Barnett Shale MVC in 2019, partially offset by lower operating and administrative costs. The benefit of higher MVCs was more than offset by the impact of lower volumes.

•Modified EBITDA for the quarter and full-year period also benefited from the absence of prior year impairment charges, as well as the benefit of a change in employee benefit policy. The full-year comparison also reflects the absence of prior-year severance charges. All of these items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

2021 Financial Guidance

The company expects 2021 Adjusted EBITDA between $5.05 billion and $5.35 billion. The company also expects 2021 growth capex between $1 billion to $1.2 billion and leverage ratio of 4.25x, providing visibility to the company’s 4.20x leverage metric objective. Importantly, Williams also anticipates it will generate positive free cash flow (after capex and dividends), allowing it to retain financial flexibility.

Non-GAAP Measures

This news release and accompanying materials may include certain financial measures – Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (“earnings”), adjusted earnings per share, distributable cash flow, available funds from operations and dividend coverage ratio – that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC.

Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments.

Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Such items are excluded from net income to determine adjusted income. Management believes these measure provide investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations.

Distributable cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, cash portion of net interest expense, income attributable to or dividends/ distributions paid to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, and certain other adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these items of our equity-method investments. We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage ratio). This measure reflects Williams’ distributable cash flow relative to its actual cash dividends paid.

Available funds from operations is defined as cash flow from operations excluding the effect of changes in working capital and certain other changes in noncurrent assets and liabilities, reduced by preferred dividends and net distributions to noncontrolling interests. 

This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of assets and the cash that the business is generating.

Neither Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, distributable cash flow, nor available funds from operations are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
