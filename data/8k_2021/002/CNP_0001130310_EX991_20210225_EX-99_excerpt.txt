CenterPoint Energy remains focused on customers, and is proud of its dedicated employees and the resiliency of its electric and gas systems during the February 2021 winter storm  

Houston - February 25, 2021 - CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported fourth quarter 2020 earnings of $0.27 per diluted common share, compared to $0.25 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2019. On a guidance basis, fourth quarter 2020 earnings were $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $0.35 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019.  

CenterPoint Energy also reported a loss available to common shareholders of $949 million, or a loss of $1.79 per diluted share, for the full-year 2020, compared with income available to common shareholders of $674 million, or $1.33 per diluted share for the full-year 2019. Full year 2020 results included after-tax non-cash impairment charges of $1,269 million or $2.25 per diluted share, associated with the company’s midstream investments. On a guidance basis, full-year 2020 earnings were $1.40 per diluted share, compared to $1.60 per diluted share for full-year 2019.  

“Our service territories, particularly here in Texas, have been significantly impacted by the recent severe winter storm. Our thoughts are with our communities and our customers as they recover from the impacts of this storm,” said Dave Lesar, President and Chief Executive Officer of CenterPoint Energy.  

“I am proud of our employees who went above and beyond to manage the impacts of the storm, the generation shortfall, and the resulting ERCOT electricity curtailment. We are also pleased with our system’s performance during this event and proud to report that over 98% of our 2.6 million electric customers had power within 12 hours of having the electricity supply made available to us.”  

“We are proactively managing our near-term working capital needs resulting from the February winter storm. Today we are pleased to announce we have secured $1.7 billion in financing commitments to help us bridge short term liquidity needs. We believe that this short-term financing, along with our existing credit facilities, will help provide ample liquidity for us to address any winter storm-related expenses.”  

“Looking back to 2020, our strong guidance based results speak to the quality of our utility business and our ability to withstand headwinds due in part to our exceptional customer growth and timely recovery mechanisms. While maintaining our 6% - 8% guidance basis Utility EPS growth target and 10% rate base compound annual growth rate, we are raising our 2021 guidance basis Utility EPS range to $1.24 - $1.26.”  

--more--   

Lesar added, “We have also recently announced our support of the merger between Enable Midstream Partners, LP and Energy Transfer LP. We committed to taking a disciplined approach to minimizing our midstream exposure on our December 7th Investor Day and this transaction is a big step for CenterPoint Energy as we deliver on our promises to our shareholders. By taking steps to significantly reduce the risk of our midstream investment and improve the liquidity of the underlying security, we can accelerate our transition to a fully regulated business model. We will keep you updated on the closing of the transaction and our plan to ultimately eliminate our midstream exposure.”  

Earnings Outlook  

Given the recently announced merger between Enable and Energy Transfer, CenterPoint Energy will only be presenting a guidance basis Utility EPS range for 2021 as Enable did not provide 2021 guidance during its recent earnings call.  

In addition to presenting its financial results in accordance with GAAP, including presentation of income (loss) available to common shareholders and diluted earnings (loss) per share, CenterPoint Energy provides guidance based on guidance basis income and guidance basis diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  

Management evaluates CenterPoint Energy’s financial performance in part based on guidance basis income and guidance basis earnings per share. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of CenterPoint Energy’s overall financial performance, by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods. The adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that Management believes do not most accurately reflect the company’s fundamental business performance. These excluded items are reflected in the reconciliation tables of this news release, where applicable. CenterPoint Energy’s guidance basis income and guidance basis diluted earnings per share non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share, which respectively are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures also may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  

(1) Utility EPS Guidance Range  

   •    

The Utility EPS guidance range includes net income from Electric and Natural Gas segments, as well as after tax Corporate and Other operating income and an allocation of corporate overhead based upon the Utility’s relative earnings contribution. Corporate overhead consists primarily of interest expense, preferred stock dividend requirements, and other items directly attributable to the parent along with the associated income taxes.  

   •    

The Utility EPS guidance excludes:  

   •    

Earnings or losses from the change in value of ZENS and related securities  

   •    

Certain expenses associated with merger integration  

   •    

Midstream Investments segment and associated income from the Enable preferred units and a corresponding amount of debt in addition to an allocation of associated corporate overhead and impact, including related expenses, associated with the merger between Enable and Energy Transfer  

   •    

Cost associated with the early extinguishment of debt  

   •    

Gain and impact, including related expenses, associated with gas LDC sales  

2   

In providing this guidance, CenterPoint Energy does not consider the items noted above and other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, impairments or other unusual items, which could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the applicable guidance period. The 2021 Utility EPS guidance range also considers assumptions for certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as customer growth and usage including normal weather, throughput, recovery of capital invested, effective tax rates, financing activities and related interest rates, and regulatory and judicial proceedings. In addition, the 2021 Utility EPS guidance range assumes a continued re-opening of the economy in CenterPoint Energy’s service territories throughout 2021. To the extent actual results deviate from these assumptions, the 2021 Utility EPS guidance range may not be met or the projected annual Utility EPS growth rate may change. CenterPoint Energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance basis diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of ZENS and related securities, future impairments, and other unusual items are not estimable and are difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management’s control.  

(2) Midstream Investments EPS Expected Range  

Midstream guidance is not initiated at this time as a result of a pending merger between Enable and Energy Transfer. CenterPoint Energy will continue to record its share of Enable’s earnings as well as basis difference accretion, earnings from the Enable preferred distributions net of an associated amount of debt, interest on the Midstream note, and an allocation of corporate overhead based on Midstream Investment segment’s relative earnings contribution until the transaction closes.  

Upon closing of the transaction, CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Energy Transfer will be accounted for as an equity method investment with a fair value option. Following the closing of the transaction, CenterPoint Energy will establish Midstream Investments EPS expected range based on the distributions from Energy Transfer and the debt and corporate allocations previously described as a component of our Midstream Investments, excluding market-to-market gains or losses recorded for the Energy Transfer investments.
