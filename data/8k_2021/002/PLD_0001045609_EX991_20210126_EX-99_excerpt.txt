Highlights * This is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see our Notes and Definitions for further explanation. Our guidance for 2021 is based on management’s current beliefs and assumptions about our business, the industry and the markets in which we operate. COVID-19 has disrupted financial markets and global, national and local economies. Given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the impact on our future results. Please refer to “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” referred to in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information. The difference between Core FFO and Net Earnings predominately relates to real estate depreciation and gains or losses on real estate transactions. See the Notes and Definitions for more information. We are further adjusting Core FFO to exclude $0.02 of net promote expense. The expense relates to amortization of stock compensation issued to employees related to promote income recognized in prior periods. Guidance (A) 4Q 2020 Supplemental 5
