Eric Bolton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continue to capture strong demand for apartment housing across our Sunbelt markets. Improving job growth and in-migration trends, that are higher than national trends, continue to support solid occupancy and positive rent growth in our portfolio. We carry good momentum into 2021 and continue to believe that we are early in a multiyear recovery cycle.  

Calendar year 2020 demonstrated, once again, the full-cycle and resilient performance profile of our strategy. Our team delivered exceptional service, results and support to our residents, associates and shareholders, while also supporting over 8,000 households impacted by COVID job loss with interest free rent deferral, waived fees and lease termination options.”

Property revenues from the Same Store Portfolio increased 1.8% during the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Results were driven by a 1.3% growth in Average Effective Rent per Unit for the Same Store Portfolio. 

•  

Property operating expenses for the Same Store Portfolio increased 6.9% during the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Growth in real estate taxes, utility costs, insurance expenses, and personnel costs drove the majority of the increase.

Same Store Portfolio Operating Results 

To ensure comparable reporting with prior periods, the Same Store Portfolio includes properties that were stabilized and owned by MAA at the beginning of the previous year. 

The Same Store Portfolio revenue growth of 1.8% during the fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily a result of a 1.3% increase in Average Effective Rent per Unit, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Average Physical Occupancy for the Same Store Portfolio was 95.7% for the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared to 95.6% in the same period in the prior year. Property operating expenses for the Same Store Portfolio increased 6.9% for the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Growth in real estate taxes, utility costs, insurance expenses, and personnel costs drove the majority of the increase. The rollout of the new high-speed bulk cable internet package contributed 0.6% in revenue growth and 1.3% in expense growth for the Same Store Portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2020. The expense associated with the high-speed bulk cable internet package is reflected in Utilities in Same Store Portfolio Property Operating Expenses presented on page S-3 of the supplemental data schedules. These changes resulted in a Same Store NOI decrease of 0.9% for the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Through February 1, 2021, Same Store Portfolio rent cash collections, represented 99.2% of billed residential rent for the fourth quarter of 2020. Same Store Portfolio lease pricing for leases effective during the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the prior lease decreased 2.5% for new leases, increased 5.2% for renewing leases and increased 0.8% for both new and renewing leases on a combined basis.  

The Same Store Portfolio revenue growth of 2.5% during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of a 2.6% increase in Average Effective Rent per Unit, as compared to the prior year. Lease pricing for the Same Store Portfolio for both

Average Physical Occupancy for the Same Store Portfolio was 95.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 95.9% for the prior year. Property operating expenses for the Same Store Portfolio increased 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. The rollout of the new high-speed bulk cable internet package contributed 0.6% in revenue growth and 0.4% in expense growth for the Same Store Portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020. These changes resulted in Same Store NOI growth of 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year.

Development and Lease-up Activity 

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, MAA had eight development communities under construction. MAA expects to complete construction of five of these development communities in 2021, two in 2022 and one in 2023. Total development costs for the eight communities are projected to be $595.0 million, of which an estimated $259.4 million remained to be funded as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.

In December 2020, MAA closed on a pre-purchase of a 317-unit multifamily apartment community development located in the Phoenix, Arizona market.  

Property Redevelopment and Repositioning Activity 

MAA continued its interior redevelopment program at select apartment communities throughout the portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 2020, MAA redeveloped the interior of 911 units, bringing the total units renovated during the year ended December 31, 2020 to 4,211 at an average cost of $6,201 per unit, achieving average rental rate increases of approximately 9.5% above non-renovated units.  

MAA continued its Smart Home technology initiative (mobile control of lights, thermostat and security, as well as leak monitoring) at select apartment communities. During the fourth quarter of 2020, 2,066 units were installed, bringing the total units installed during the year ended December 31, 2020 to 23,950 at an average cost of $1,376 per unit, achieving an average rental rate increase of approximately $25 per unit.  

During the fourth quarter of 2020, MAA continued its program to upgrade and reposition the amenity and common areas at select properties. The program includes targeted plans to move all units at the properties to higher rents that are expected to deliver yields on cost averaging 8% beginning in calendar year 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2020, repositioning work continued at eight of these properties. For the year ended December 31, 2020, MAA spent $13.0 million on this program.  

Capital Expenditures 

Recurring capital expenditures totaled $21.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, or approximately $0.18 per Share, as compared to $14.3 million, or $0.12 per Share, for the same period in the prior year. These expenditures led to Core Adjusted Funds from Operations, or Core AFFO, of $1.47 per Share for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $1.54 per Share for the same period in the prior year. 

Redevelopment, revenue enhancing, commercial and other capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2020 were $65.6 million, as compared to $27.8 million for the same period in the prior year. These expenditures led to Funds Available for Distribution, or FAD, of $108.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $153.9 million for the same period in the prior year. 

Recurring capital expenditures totaled $80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or approximately $0.68 per Share, as compared to $72.8 million, or $0.62 per Share, for the prior year. These expenditures led to Core AFFO of $5.75 per Share for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5.64 per Share for the prior year. 

3 

Redevelopment, revenue enhancing, commercial and other capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $145.1 million, as compared to $117.4 million for the prior year. These expenditures led to FAD of $535.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $549.0 million for the prior year. 

A reconciliation of FFO, Core FFO, Core AFFO and FAD to net income available for MAA common shareholders, and an expanded discussion of the components of FFO, Core FFO, Core AFFO and FAD, can be found later in this release. 

Financing Activities 

As of December 31, 2020, MAA had $849.8 million of combined cash and available capacity under MAA’s operating partnership’s (Mid-America Apartments, L.P., referred to as MAALP or the Operating Partnership) unsecured revolving credit facility, net of commercial paper borrowings. 

Dividends and distributions paid on shares of common stock and noncontrolling interests during the fourth quarter of 2020 were $118.6 million, as compared to $113.6 million for the same period in the prior year. 

Balance Sheet 

As of December 31, 2020: 

•  

Total debt to adjusted total assets (as defined in the covenants for the bonds issued by MAALP) was 31.2%; 

•  

Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion with an average effective interest rate of approximately 3.6%; 

•  

96.2% of total debt was fixed against rising interest rates for an average of approximately 7.7 years; and 

•  

Unencumbered NOI was 93.4% of total NOI. 

108th Consecutive Quarterly Common Dividend Declared 

MAA declared its 108th consecutive quarterly common dividend, which was paid on January 29, 2021 to holders of record on January 15, 2021. The current annual dividend rate is $4.10 per common share, an increase of 2.5% from the prior year’s annual rate of $4.00.  

2021 Net Income per Diluted Common Share, Core FFO per Share and Core AFFO per Share Guidance 

MAA is providing initial 2021 guidance for Net income per diluted common share, as well as Core FFO per Share, and Core AFFO per Share. MAA expects to update its 2021 Net income per diluted common share, Core FFO per Share and Core AFFO per Share guidance on a quarterly basis. 

FFO, Core FFO and Core AFFO are non-GAAP measures. Acquisition and disposition activity materially affects depreciation and capital gains or losses, which combined, generally represent the majority of the difference between Net income available for common shareholders and FFO. As discussed in the definitions of non-GAAP measures found later in this release, MAA's definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts', or NAREIT's, definition, and Core FFO represents FFO further adjusted for items that are not considered part of MAA’s core business operations. MAA believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that Core FFO excludes not only depreciation expense of real estate assets and certain other non-routine items, but it also excludes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

MAA expects Core FFO for the first quarter of 2021 to be in the range of $1.51 to $1.67 per Share, or $1.59 per Share at the midpoint. MAA does not forecast Net income per diluted share on a quarterly basis as MAA cannot accurately predict the timing of forecasted acquisition and disposition activity within a particular quarter (rather than during the course of the full year).

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES   

Adjusted EBITDAre 

For purposes of calculations in this release, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate, or Adjusted EBITDAre, represents EBITDAre further adjusted for items that are not considered part of MAA’s core operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares, gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets, adjustments for gains or losses from unconsolidated limited partnerships, net casualty gain or loss, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, non-routine legal costs and settlements, COVID-19 related costs and mark-to-market debt adjustments. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers Adjusted EBITDAre to be an important measure of performance from core operations because Adjusted EBITDAre does not include various income and expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. MAA’s computation of Adjusted EBITDAre may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate Adjusted EBITDAre. Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to Net income as an indicator of operating performance. 

Core Adjusted Funds from Operations (Core AFFO) 

Core AFFO is composed of Core FFO less recurring capital expenditures. Core AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers Core AFFO to be an important measure of performance from operations because Core AFFO measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and recurring capital expenditures. 

Core Funds from Operations (Core FFO) 

Core FFO represents FFO as adjusted for items that are not considered part of MAA’s core business operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares, gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets, adjustments for gains or losses from unconsolidated limited partnerships, net casualty gain or loss, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, non-routine legal costs and settlements, COVID-19 related costs and mark-to-market debt adjustments. While MAA's definition of Core FFO may be similar to others in the industry, MAA’s methodology for calculating Core FFO may differ from that utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. MAA believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding its core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance. 

EBITDA 

For purposes of calculations in this release, Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or EBITDA, is composed of net income plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income taxes. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers EBITDA to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDA does not include various expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income as an indicator of operating performance. 

EBITDAre 

For purposes of calculations in this release, Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate, or EBITDAre, is composed of EBITDA further adjusted for the gain or loss on sale of depreciable asset sales and plus adjustments to reflect MAA’s share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers EBITDAre to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDAre does not include various expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. While MAA’s definition of EBITDAre is in accordance with NAREIT’s definition, it may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate EBITDAre. EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to Net income as an indicator of operating performance. 

Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) 

FAD is composed of Core FFO less total capital expenditures, excluding development spending and property acquisitions. FAD should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers FAD to be an important measure of performance from core operations because FAD measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and total capital expenditures.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Continued)   

Funds From Operations (FFO) 

FFO represents net income available for MAA common shareholders (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and adjustments for joint ventures. Because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back, FFO, when used in this document, represents FFO attributable to the Company. While MAA’s definition of FFO is in accordance with NAREIT’s definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other companies. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. MAA believes that FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. MAA believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. 

Gross Assets 

Gross Assets represents Total assets plus Accumulated depreciation. MAA believes that Gross Assets can be used as a helpful tool in evaluating its balance sheet positions.

NOI should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders.

Non-Same Store and Other NOI 

Non-Same Store and Other NOI represents Rental and other property revenues less Total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for all properties classified within the Non-Same Store and Other Portfolio during the period.

OTHER KEY DEFINITIONS   

Average Effective Rent per Unit 

Average Effective Rent per Unit represents the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units.

Same Store Portfolio 

MAA reviews its Same Store Portfolio at the beginning of each calendar year, or as significant transactions or events warrant. Communities are generally added into the Same Store Portfolio if they were owned and stabilized at the beginning of the previous year. Communities are considered stabilized after achieving at least 90% occupancy for 90 days. Communities that have been approved by MAA’s Board of Directors for disposition are excluded from the Same Store Portfolio. Communities that have undergone a significant casualty loss are also excluded from the Same Store Portfolio.
