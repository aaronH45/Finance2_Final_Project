Item 8.01. Other Events

On Jan. 4, 2021, Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS), a New Mexico corporation, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed an electric rate case with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) seeking an increase in base rates of approximately $88 million. SPS' net rate increase to New Mexico customers is expected to be approximately $48 million, or 10%, as a result of offsetting fuel cost reductions and production tax credits (PTCs) attributable to wind energy provided by the Sagamore wind project. PTCs are being credited to customers through the fuel clause. 

The request is primarily driven by additional capital investment in new and upgraded electric facilities and equipment since SPS’ previous rate case in 2019, including New Mexico's allocated portion of the 522 megawatt Sagamore wind project, which began commercial operations on time in December 2020. 

The request is based on a historic test year ended Sept. 30, 2020, including expected capital additions through Feb. 28, 2021, a return on equity of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.72% (based on actual capital structure) and retail rate base of approximately $1.9 billion (total company rate base of approximately $6.0 billion). 

Additionally, the request includes the effect of approximately 400 megawatts of reduced peak load in 2021 from a wholesale transmission customer and changes to depreciation rates to reflect a reduction to the service lives of SPS’ Tolk power plant (from 2037 to 2032) and the coal handling assets at the Harrington facility (to 2024). 

SPS’ base rate request:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SPS requested new rates to be effective on Feb. 3, 2021, however the NMPRC is expected to suspend rates for nine months beyond the 30-day notice period, consistent with historic practice, pending review. A NMPRC decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2021.
