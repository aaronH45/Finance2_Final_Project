UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Acquisition of Montage Resources Corporation

On November 13, 2020, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 12, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and between Southwestern Energy Company (“Southwestern”) and Montage Resources Corporation (“Montage”), Southwestern completed its previously announced acquisition of Montage, by means of a merger of Montage with and into Southwestern, with Southwestern continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). 

In accordance with the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each issued and outstanding share of Montage common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Montage Common Stock”), was automatically converted into the right to receive 1.8656 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Southwestern common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Southwestern Common Stock”). No fractional shares of Southwestern Common Stock were issued in the Merger, and holders of Montage Common Stock received cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Southwestern Common Stock which such holders would otherwise be entitled to receive.

In addition, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, (i) each Montage restricted stock unit award that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into an assumed restricted stock unit award, (ii) each Montage performance stock unit award was terminated and vested, and (iii) each Montage restricted stock award granted to a Montage non-employee director vested.

Additionally, in August 2020, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 63,250,000 shares of common stock with an offering price to the public of $2.50 per share, with net proceeds from the offering totaling $152 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. Also in August 2020, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior notes due 2028. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $345 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the debt offering, together with the net proceeds received from the common stock offering and borrowings under its revolving credit facility, to fund the redemption of the $510 million aggregate principal amount of Montage’s outstanding 8.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Montage Notes”), the pay off of the outstanding Montage credit facility balance and all related accrued interest in connection with the closing of the Merger.

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of Southwestern and Montage, and have been adjusted to reflect the Merger along with the related equity and debt issuances and the use of proceeds therefrom. The Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with Southwestern identified as the acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, Southwestern recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair values at the Effective Time. Certain of Montage’s historical amounts have been reclassified to conform to Southwestern’s financial statement presentation. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2020 gives effect to the Merger and related equity and debt issuances, along with the use of proceeds therefrom, as if each transaction had been completed on September 30, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 give effect to the Merger and the related equity and debt issuances as if each transaction had been completed on January 1, 2019.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect the following Merger-related pro forma adjustments, based on available information and certain assumptions that Southwestern believes are reasonable:

•the Merger, which was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, with Southwestern identified as the acquirer, and the issuance of shares of Southwestern Common Stock in exchange of Montage Common Stock as Merger consideration;

•adjustments to conform Montage’s historical accounting policies related to oil and natural gas properties from the successful efforts method of accounting to the full cost method of accounting used by Southwestern;

•the conversion of Montage’s outstanding stock-based awards into shares of Southwestern Common Stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement;

•Southwestern’s related equity and debt issuances and the redemption of Montage’s outstanding senior notes as well as repayment in full and termination of Montage’s revolving credit facility and all related accrued interest, each of which occurred in connection with the consummation of the Merger;

•adjustments to conform the classification of certain assets and liabilities in Montage’s historical balance sheet to Southwestern’s classification for similar assets and liabilities;

•adjustments to conform the classification of revenues and expenses in Montage’s historical statements of operations to Southwestern’s classification for similar revenues and expenses; and

•the recognition of estimated tax impacts of the pro forma adjustments.

Assumptions and estimates underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. In Southwestern’s opinion, all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the pro forma information have been made. The historical consolidated financial statements have been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements to give effect to the Merger and related equity and debt issuances along with the use of proceeds therefrom. These adjustments are directly attributable to the Merger, factually supportable and, with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results of Southwestern and Montage following the Merger.

The purchase price allocation is dependent upon certain valuations and other studies that, as of the date hereof, have yet to progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measure. As of the date of this current report, Southwestern has performed an initial valuation analysis of the fair value of Montage’s assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed and has made certain adjustments to the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of Montage to reflect preliminary estimates of the fair value necessary to prepare the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. As a result of the foregoing, the pro forma adjustments are preliminary and are subject to change as additional information becomes available, additional review and analysis is performed or additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The preliminary pro forma adjustments have been made solely for the purpose of providing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements presented below. Southwestern estimated the fair value of Montage’s assets and liabilities based on discussions with Montage’s management, initial valuation studies, due diligence, and information presented in Montage’s SEC filings. Any increases or decreases in the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon completion of the final valuations will result in adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and/or statements of operations. The final purchase price allocation may be materially different than that reflected in the pro forma purchase price allocation presented herein.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not intended to represent what Southwestern’s financial position or results of operations would have been had the Merger actually been consummated on the assumed dates nor does it purport to project the future operating results or financial position of the combined company following the Merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect future events that may occur after the Merger, including, but not limited to, the anticipated realization of ongoing savings from potential operating efficiencies, asset dispositions, cost savings, or economies of scale that the combined company may achieve with respect to the combined operations. Specifically, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not include projected synergies expected to be achieved as a result of the Merger and any associated costs that may be required to be incurred to achieve those synergies. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations also exclude the effects of transaction costs associated with the Merger, costs associated with any restructuring, integration activities, and asset dispositions that may result from the Merger. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in Southwestern’s and Montage’s respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of Southwestern and Montage. Certain of Montage’s historical amounts have been reclassified to conform to Southwestern’s financial statement presentation. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2020 gives effect to the Merger and related equity and debt issuances along with the use of proceeds therefrom as if they had occurred on September 30, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 both give effect to the Merger and related equity and debt issuances along with the use of proceeds therefrom as if they had occurred on January 1, 2019.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect pro forma adjustments that are described in these notes and are based on available information and certain assumptions that Southwestern believes are reasonable, however, actual results may differ from those reflected in these statements. In Southwestern’s opinion, all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the pro forma information have been made. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements do not purport to represent what the Company’s financial position or results of operations would have been if the transaction had actually occurred on the dates indicated above, nor are they indicative of Southwestern’s future financial position or results of operations. These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of Southwestern and Montage for the periods presented.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information includes adjustments to conform Montage’s accounting policies to Southwestern’s accounting policies, including adjusting Montage’s oil and gas properties to the full cost method. Montage follows the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties, while Southwestern follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Certain costs that are expensed under the successful efforts method are capitalized under the full cost method, including unsuccessful exploration drilling costs, geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals on leases and general and administrative expenses directly related to exploration and development activities. Under the full cost method of accounting, property acquisition costs, costs of wells, related equipment and facilities and future development costs are all included in a single full cost pool, which is amortized on a units-of-production basis over total proved reserves. Under the successful efforts method of accounting, property acquisition costs are amortized on a units-of-production basis over total proved reserves, while costs of wells and related equipment and facilities are amortized on a units-of-production basis over proved developed reserves. The pro forma condensed combined financial information has reclassified Montage’s exploration expenses, which are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties.

Note 2. Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet

The Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting using the accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations. The allocation of the initial estimated purchase price is based upon management’s estimates of and assumptions related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of September 30, 2020 using currently available information. Due to the fact that the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared based on these initial estimates, the final purchase price allocation and the resulting effect on financial position and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts included herein. Southwestern expects to finalize its allocation of the purchase consideration as soon as practicable. 

The initial purchase price allocation is subject to change due to changes in the estimated fair value of Montage’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the transaction, resulting from the finalization of Southwestern’s detailed valuation analysis.

The preliminary consideration to be transferred and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Under the Merger Agreement, Montage shareholders received 1.8656 shares of Southwestern common stock for each share of Montage common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. In addition, certain members of Montage’s management team with 471,326 outstanding restricted stock units (“RSU”) and 831,059 outstanding performance units (“PSU”) received 1.8656 shares of Southwestern common stock for each RSU and PSU outstanding under existing change of control agreements. This resulted in Southwestern issuing approximately 69.7 million shares of Southwestern common stock, or approximately $213 million in value (based on Southwestern common stock closing price as of November 13, 2020 of $3.05), as Merger consideration.

The Merger was non-taxable, and Montage’s tax basis in the assets and liabilities carried over to Southwestern.

Note 3. Pro Forma Adjustments

The following adjustments have been made to the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements:

(a)The following reclassifications and eliminations were made as a result of the transaction to conform to Southwestern’s presentation:

Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2020:

•Reflects reclassification of approximately $3 million from other current assets to derivative assets;

•Reflects reclassification of approximately $12 million from accrued capital expenditures and $11 million from other current liabilities to accounts payable;

•Reflects reclassification of approximately $9 million from other current liabilities to taxes payable;

•Reflects reclassification of approximately $23 million from other current liabilities to derivative liabilities;

•Reflects reclassification of approximately $170 million from revolving credit facility to long-term debt; and

•Reflects reclassification of approximately $158 million from transportation, gathering and compression to operating expenses;

•Reflects the elimination of $34 million of exploration expenses which are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties used by Southwestern;

•Reflects reclassification of approximately $10 million from production and ad valorem taxes to taxes, other than income; and

•Reflects reclassification of $4 million of interest on debt to other interest charges related to the amortization of debt issuance costs.

Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019:

•Reflects reclassification of approximately $592 million from natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids sales to the respective sales revenues by product ($361 million for gas sales, $146 million for oil sales and $85 million for NGL sales);

•Reflects reclassification of approximately $209 million from transportation, gathering and compression to operating expenses;

(b)Upon closing of the Merger, Southwestern assumed Montage's long-term debt balance which included their 8.875% Senior Notes due 2023 with a principal balance of $510 million (the "Montage Notes") and the Montage credit facility balance of $170 million as of September 30, 2020. These adjustments reflect the use of available cash and cash equivalents and incremental borrowings under the Southwestern credit facility, to fund a redemption of Montage Notes and the Montage credit facility shortly after the consummation of the Merger. The redemption of the Montage Notes includes a $12 million 

premium related to the call price of 102.219% for a total required payment of $522 million, plus accrued interest of $10 million. 

•The following adjustments were made to reflect the sources of funds utilized to retire the $510 million Montage Notes, the Montage credit facility and related accrued interest:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(c)During August 2020, in contemplation of the Merger, Southwestern completed an offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% Senior Notes due 2028 resulting in net proceeds of $345 million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses (the “Southwestern Debt Offering”). The proceeds from the Southwestern Debt Offering were temporarily used to pay down the balance on Southwestern’s credit facility as of September 30, 2020. These adjustments reflect the use of the net proceeds from the Southwestern Debt Offering, available cash and cash equivalents and incremental borrowings under the Southwestern credit facility, to fund a redemption of Montage Notes, the Montage credit facility and all related accrued interest shortly after the consummation of the Merger.

Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations as of September 30, 2020:

•Reflects an approximately $21 million net decrease in interest on debt related to the retirement of the Montage Notes, the Montage credit facility, all related accrued interest and the associated decrease in amortization of issuance costs related to the Montage Notes and revolving line of credit. This decrease was partially offset by increases in interest on debt associated with the issuance of $350 million in new 8.375% Senior Notes due 2028 related to the Southwestern Debt Offering and borrowings under Southwestern’s credit facility used to pay off the Montage Notes, Montage credit facility and related accrued interest.

Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations as of December 31, 2019:

•Reflects an approximately $20 million net decrease in interest on debt related to the retirement of the Montage Notes, the Montage credit facility, all related accrued interest and the associated decrease in amortization of issuance costs related to the Montage Notes and revolving line of credit. This decrease was partially offset by increases in interest on debt associated with the issuance of $350 million in new 8.375% Senior Notes due 2028 related to the Southwestern Debt 

Offering and borrowings under Southwestern’s credit facility used to pay off the Montage Notes, Montage credit facility and related accrued interest.

(d)The allocation of the estimated fair value of consideration transferred (based on the closing price of Southwestern common stock of $3.05 per share at November 13, 2020) to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in the following purchase price allocation adjustments:

•$623 million decrease to Montage’s net book basis of oil and gas properties to reflect them at fair value;

•$16 million increase to other property, plant and equipment to reflect them at fair value; and

•$12 million increase in long-term debt to reflect the Montage Notes at fair value.

(e)Reflects the write-off of approximately $3 million in unamortized debt issuance costs related to Montage’s revolving credit facility.

(f)Reflects the increase in long-term debt as a result of the write-off of approximately $7 million in unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs related to the Montage Notes.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(h)Reflects the increase in shares of Southwestern common stock resulting from the issuance of shares of Southwestern common stock to Montage shareholders and management team to effect the transaction as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(i)Reflects the pro forma Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization expense calculated in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties, which was based on the initial purchase price allocation.

(j)Reflects the increase in capitalized interest related to the initial fair value associated with the unevaluated oil and gas properties acquired from Montage.

(k)Reflects the income tax effects on Montage’s historical income before tax and the pro forma adjustments presented at a blended federal and state statutory rate of approximately 23.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019.

(l)During August 2020, in contemplation of the Merger, Southwestern completed an equity offering of 63.25 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $152 million, which were already reflected in our historical consolidated condensed balance sheet 

as of September 30, 2020. These adjustments reflect the impact of these additional shares on the weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding used to calculate the respective earnings per share amounts.
