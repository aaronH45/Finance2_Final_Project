SEGMENT INFORMATION

Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper's management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses and is calculated as set forth in footnote (i) below under "Sales and Earnings by Business Segment."

Business Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Industrial Packaging operating profits (losses) in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $431 million compared with $469 million in the third quarter of 2020. In North America, earnings decreased as higher sales volumes for boxes and lower planned maintenance outage expenses were more than offset by increased operating, distribution and input costs. In Europe, earnings increased driven by higher sales volumes, reflecting seasonality in Morocco and continued COVID-19 pandemic related demand recovery in all regions. Average sales margins increased, primarily driven by continued improvement in Turkey. Operating costs were higher.

Global Cellulose Fibers operating profits (losses) in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $(114) million compared with $(59) million in the third quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter was impacted by seasonally higher operating costs and higher planned maintenance outage expenses, partially offset by lower economic downtime. Average sales prices were lower. Operating costs were negatively impacted by the non-repeat of favorable one-time items in the third quarter of 2020.

Printing Papers operating profits (losses) in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $80 million compared with $63 million in the third quarter of 2020. In North America, earnings decreased driven by seasonally higher operating costs and higher input costs, partially offset by lower economic downtime and higher sales volumes reflecting continued improvement from the negative demand impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Average sales margins were slightly lower, reflecting an unfavorable mix. Planned maintenance outage expenses were lower. In Brazil, earnings increased due to higher sales volumes and lower economic 

downtime reflecting seasonality and continued recovery from the negative demand impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Average sales margins improved driven by a favorable geographic mix. In Europe and Russia, earnings improved driven by higher sales volumes, lower economic downtime and lower planned maintenance outage expenses, partially offset by higher operating costs. 

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

Ilim joint venture equity earnings (loss) were $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $(33) million in the third quarter of 2020. Operationally, earnings improved driven by higher export sales prices for softwood pulp and containerboard. Sales volumes increased, reflecting higher production volumes compared with the third quarter of 2020 which was impacted by maintenance outages. The Company recognized a non-cash after-tax foreign exchange gain of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 ($0.05 per diluted share), compared with a loss of $55 million in the third quarter of 2020 ($0.14 per diluted share), primarily due to Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt.

Graphic Packaging equity earnings on our 15.0% ownership position were $11 million in both the fourth and third quarters of 2020. 

CORPORATE EXPENSES

Corporate expenses (income) were $(16) million for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $(20) million in the third quarter of 2020. 

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

The reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 28%, compared to a 2020 third quarter effective tax rate of 18%. The reported effective tax rate in the fourth quarter is higher due to tax expense related to a non-deductible impairment of our EMEA Packaging business in Turkey, which is offset by a tax benefit related to the closure of the 2013-2014 IRS audit. The reported effective tax rate in the third quarter reflects tax benefits recognized after the finalization of the 2019 U.S. Federal income tax return. The tax benefits recorded in the third quarter are primarily related to increased U.S. research and development tax credits and lower than estimated U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings. 

Excluding net special items and non-operating pension expense, the operational effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 26%, compared with 19% for the third quarter of 2020. The operational effective tax rate is lower in the third quarter as a result of tax benefits recognized after the finalization of the 2019 U.S. Federal income tax return. The tax benefits recorded in the third quarter are primarily related to increased U.S. research and development tax credits and lower than estimated U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings. 

EFFECTS OF NET SPECIAL ITEMS

Net special items in the fourth quarter of 2020 amount to a net after-tax charge of $151 million ($0.38 per diluted share) compared with $83 million ($0.21 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2020 and $258 million ($0.65 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2019.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY

Reconciliation of Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to International Paper Company to Adjusted Operating Earnings

Preliminary and Unaudited

(In millions, except per share amounts)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

The Company calculates Adjusted Operating Earnings (non-GAAP) by excluding the after-tax effect of non-operating pension expense (income) and items considered by management to be unusual (net special items) as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and related notes included in this release from the earnings reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results. The Company believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations by quarter. Net earnings (loss) attributable to International Paper is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

 Since diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each period, twelve-month per share amounts may not equal the sum of respective quarters.

Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operations to Free Cash Flow

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is cash provided by operations. Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, service debt and make investments for future growth. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. By adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing performance, free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods. 

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company’s presentation of non-GAAP measures in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in the same industry as International Paper.

Management believes certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, can facilitate a better understanding of the impact of various factors and trends on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Management also uses these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.
