 FULL YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER 2020 FINANCIAL AND PRODUCTION SUMMARY  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Attributable gold production1 for the year decreased 6 percent to 5,905 thousand ounces from the prior year primarily due to Yanacocha and Cerro Negro being placed into care and maintenance in response to the Covid pandemic, lower ore grade mined at Ahafo and the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie, partially offset by a full year of operations from assets acquired in April 2019.  

 Attributable gold production for the fourth quarter decreased 11 percent to 1,630 thousand from the prior year quarter primarily due to the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie, lower production at Cerro Negro as the site continues to ramp up while managing COVID restrictions and lower ore grade mined at Ahafo, partially offset by higher production at Musselwhite following the completion of the conveyor and materials handling system and higher production at Peñasquito with the successful resolution of community relation issues in late-2019.  

 Gold CAS2 decreased 5 percent to $4.4 billion for the full year and 4 percent to $1.2 billion for the quarter, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower ounces sold. For the full year, Gold CAS per ounce increased 5 percent to $756 per ounce primarily due to lower ore grade mined at Yanacocha, Merian and Ahafo, partially offset by lower stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments.  

 For the fourth quarter, Gold CAS per ounce increased 7 percent to $739 per ounce primarily due to lower ore grade mined at Ahafo and Porcupine, lower mill throughput at Cerro Negro and higher gold price-related royalties.  

 Gold AISC3 for the year increased 8 percent to $1,045 per ounce from the prior year primarily due to higher CAS per ounce and Covid-related care and maintenance costs.  

 Gold AISC per ounce for the fourth quarter increased 10 percent to $1,043 per ounce from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher CAS per ounce and higher sustaining capital largely driven by the Autonomous Haulage System progressing ahead of schedule at Boddington.  

 Attributable gold equivalent ounce (GEO) production from other metals for the year increased 64 percent to 1,021 thousand ounces from the prior year primarily due to a full year of operations from Peñasquito following resolution of the community issues in late-2019, partially offset by the site being placed on care and maintenance in the second quarter of 2020.  

 Attributable GEO production from other metals for the quarter increased 18 percent to 271 thousand ounces from the prior year primarily due to operations at Peñasquito receiving sustained community support following the blockade in 2019, partially offset by lower ore grade milled at Boddington.  

 CAS from other metals totaled $606 million for the year and $157 million for the quarter. CAS per GEO2 for the year improved 33 percent to $571 per ounce primarily due to higher sales at Peñasquito. CAS per GEO for the quarter improved 29 percent to $561 per ounce primarily due to higher sales at Peñasquito, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts from the strengthening of the Australian dollar and lower sales at Boddington. AISC per GEO3 for the year improved 30 percent to $858 per ounce primarily due to lower CAS from other metals, partially offset by care and maintenance costs. AISC per GEO for the quarter improved 28 percent to $846 per ounce primarily due to lower CAS from other metals and lower sustaining capital spend.  

 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders for the year was $2,666 million or $3.31 per diluted share, a decrease of $211 million from the prior year primarily due to a $2,390 million recognized gain on the formation of NGM in the prior year. After removing the gain related to NGM, net income increased $2,179 million from the prior year largely driven by higher realized gold prices, gains on asset and investment sales, lower transaction and integration costs and lower general and administrative costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes from certain sites being placed on care and maintenance, the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie, and higher costs in response to the Covid pandemic.  

 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders for the quarter was $806 million or $1.00 per diluted share, an increase of $269 million from the prior year primarily due to higher realized gold prices and gains on asset and investment sales, partially offset by lower sales volumes from the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie, higher tax expense and reclamation and remediation adjustments primarily related to increased costs at Yanacocha.  

 Adjusted net income4 for the year was $2,140 million or $2.66 per diluted share, compared to $970 million or $1.32 per diluted share in the prior year.  

 Adjusted net income for the quarter was $856 million or $1.06 per diluted share, compared to $410 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the prior year. Primary adjustments to fourth quarter net income include reclamation and remediation adjustments, gains on asset and investment sales, changes in the fair value of investments, Covid-specific costs, settlement costs, asset impairments and valuation allowance and other tax adjustments.  

 Adjusted EBITDA5 for the year increased 48 percent to $5.5 billion, compared to $3.7 billion for the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 37 percent to $1.8 billion for the quarter, compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year quarter.  

 Revenue increased 18 percent to $11,497 million for the full year and 14 percent to $3,381 million for the quarter, compared to the prior year. These increases were primarily due to higher average realized gold prices and higher gold equivalent sales volumes, partially offset by lower gold sales volumes.  

 Average realized price6 for gold increased $376 per ounce to $1,775 per ounce for the full year and $374 per ounce to $1,852 per ounce for the quarter, compared to the prior year. For the full year, average realized gold price comprised $1,778 per ounce of gross price received, the favorable impact of $9 per ounce mark-to-market on provisionally-priced sales and $12 per ounce reductions for treatment and refining charges. For the quarter, average realized gold price comprised $1,865 per ounce of gross price received, the favorable impact of $4 per ounce favorable mark-to-market on provisionally-priced sales and $17 per ounce reductions for treatment and refining charges.  

 Capital expenditures7 decreased 11 percent to $1,302 million for the full year and decreased 7 percent to $398 million for the quarter, compared to prior year, primarily due to the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie and reduced spending from the completion of Borden Underground, Ahafo Mill Expansion, and other sustaining projects in 2019. Development capital expenditures in 2020 primarily include advancing Tanami Expansion 2, Yanacocha Sulfides, Ahafo North, the Subika mining method change, Musselwhite Materials Handling System, Éléonore Lower Mine Material Handling System, Quecher Main, and projects associated with the Company’s ownership interest in Nevada Gold Mines.  

 Consolidated operating cash flow from continuing operations increased 70 percent to $4.9 billion for the full year and increased 40 percent to $1.7 billion for the quarter, compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher realized gold prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Free Cash Flow8 also increased to $3.6 billion for the full year and $1.3 billion for the quarter primarily due to higher operating cash flow and lower capital expenditures.  

 Balance sheet strengthened in 2020 ending the year with $5.5 billion of consolidated cash and approximately $8.5 billion of liquidity; reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 0.2x9.  

 Portfolio improvements achieved during the year: Completed divestment of the Red Lake Complex in Canada, the Company’s 50 percent ownership interest in Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines in Australia, investment holdings in Continental Gold, and a portfolio of eleven royalties; formed exploration joint ventures with Kirkland Lake Gold Inc. in Canada and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited in Colombia; completed materials handling projects at Musselwhite and Éléonore in Canada; progressed Autonomous Haulage System at Boddington in Australia, the Tanami Expansion 2 project in Australia, and a mining method change at Subika Underground in Ghana; advanced study work at Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides with both projects expected to reach full funds approval in 2021.  

 Nevada Gold Mines (NGM) attributable gold production for the year was 1,334 thousand ounces with CAS of $757 per ounce and AISC of $920 per ounce. NGM attributable gold production for the quarter was 342 thousand ounces with CAS of $739 per ounce and AISC of $872 per ounce. EBITDA10 for NGM was $1,279 million for the full year and $364 million for the quarter.

 COVID-19 UPDATE  

 Newmont continues to maintain wide-ranging protective measures for its workforce and neighboring communities, including screening, physical distancing, deep cleaning and avoiding exposure for at-risk individuals. The Company incurred care and maintenance costs of $178 million during 2020 and $7 million during the quarter, which included wages and direct operating costs for critical activities. The Company also recorded non-cash depreciation of $88 million during 2020 and $2 million during the quarter for sites ramping up from care and maintenance or continuing to operate at reduced levels. In addition, the Company incurred incremental Covid specific costs of $92 million during 2020 and $25 million during the quarter for activities such as additional health and safety procedures, increased transportation and community fund contributions.  

 PROJECTS UPDATE  

 Newmont’s capital-efficient project pipeline supports improving production, lower costs and extending mine life. Funding for the current development capital project Tanami Expansion 2 has been approved and the project is in execution stage. The Company has included the Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides projects in its long-term outlook as the projects are scheduled to be approved for full funding in 2021. Additional projects, not listed below, represent incremental improvements to the Company's outlook.  

     Tanami Expansion 2 (Australia) secures Tanami’s future as a long-life, low-cost producer with potential to extend mine life beyond 2040 through the addition of a 1,460 meter hoisting shaft and supporting infrastructure to achieve 3.5 million tonnes per year of production and provide a platform for future growth. The expansion is expected to increase average annual gold production by approximately 150,000 to 200,000 ounces per year for the first five years and is expected to reduce operating costs by approximately 10 percent. Capital costs for the project are estimated to be between $850 million and $950 million with a commercial production date in the first half of 2024. 

   Ahafo North (Africa) expands our existing footprint in Ghana with four open pit mines and a stand-alone mill located approximately 30 kilometers from the Company’s Ahafo South operations. An investment decision is expected in the first half of 2021 and the project is expected to add 300,000 ounces per year with all-in sustaining costs between $600 to $700 per ounce for the first five full years of production (2024-2028), with estimated capital costs of between $700 and $800 million. Ahafo North is the best unmined gold deposit in West Africa with approximately 3.5 million ounces of Reserves and more than 1 million ounces of Measured and Indicated and Inferred Resource11 and significant upside potential to extend beyond Ahafo North’s current 13-year mine life. 

   Yanacocha Sulfides (South America)12 will develop the first phase of sulfide deposits and an integrated processing circuit, including an autoclave to process gold, copper and silver feedstock. The project is expected to add 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year with all-in sustaining costs between $700 to $800 per ounce for the first five full years of production (2026-2030). An investment decision is expected in the second half of 2021 with a three year development period and estimated capital costs of approximately $2 billion. The first phase focuses on developing the Yanacocha Verde and Chaquicocha deposits to extend Yanacocha’s operations beyond 2040 with second and third phases having the potential to extend life for multiple decades.

 STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT LEADERSHIP TRANSITION   

 Randy Engel, Executive Vice President of Strategic Development has elected to retire from Newmont in the second quarter. Randy has made many significant contributions to Newmont over his distinguished 27-year career with the company which have positioned Newmont as the world’s leading gold company. Randy’s responsibilities will be assumed by Blake Rhodes who is currently serving as Senior Vice President of Strategic Development. Blake joined Newmont in 1996 and has held a variety of roles, including General Counsel and Senior Vice President in charge of our Indonesian business.  

 OUTLOOK   

 Newmont’s outlook reflects increasing gold production and ongoing investment in its operating assets and most promising growth prospects. The Company has included Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides in its outlook for the first time as the development projects are expected to reach execution stage in 2021. Additional development projects that have not reached execution stage represent upside to guidance. All production, cost and capital figures assume a $1,200/oz gold price.  

 Newmont’s 2021 and longer-term outlook assumes operations continue without major Covid-related interruptions. If at any point the Company determines that continuing operations poses an increased risk to our workforce or host communities, it will reduce operational activities up to, and including, care and maintenance and management of critical environmental systems. Please see cautionary statement in the end notes for additional information.

 Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization  

 Management uses Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA adjusted for non-core or certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management’s determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Additionally, the Company uses Pueblo Viejo EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure to evaluate the operating performance of its investment in the Pueblo Viejo mine. Pueblo Viejo EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, Equity income (loss) of affiliates, as defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash distributions from Pueblo Viejo will match Pueblo Viejo EBITDA or earnings from affiliates. Although the Company has the ability to exert significant influence, it does not have direct control over the operations or resulting revenues and expenses, nor does it proportionately consolidate its investment in Pueblo Viejo. The Company believes that Pueblo Viejo EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the operating results of its investment in Pueblo Viejo, in the same manner as management and the Board of Directors.

 Free Cash Flow  

 Management uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free Cash Flow is Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations less Additions to property, plant and mine development as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company’s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company’s calculation of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.  

 The presentation of non-GAAP Free Cash Flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company’s performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. The Company’s definition of Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view Free Cash Flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  

 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow, as well as information regarding Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.

 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities includes Additions to property, plant and mine development, which is included in the Company’s computation of Free Cash Flow.​     

 Attributable Free Cash Flow  

 Management uses Attributable Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations that are attributable to the Company. Attributable Free Cash Flow is Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities after deducting net cash flows from operations attributable to noncontrolling interests less Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations after deducting net cash flows from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests less Additions to property, plant and mine development after deducting property, plant and mine development attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company believes that Attributable Free Cash Flow is useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company’s performance with its competitors. Although Attributable Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company’s calculation of Attributable Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.  

 The presentation of non-GAAP Attributable Free Cash Flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders as an indicator of the Company’s performance, or as an alternative to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. The Company’s definition of Attributable Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the  

 measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view Attributable Free Cash Flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  

 The following tables set forth a reconciliation of Attributable Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Attributable Free Cash Flow, as well as information regarding Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.

 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce   

 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and other metals by gold ounces or gold equivalent ounces sold, respectively. These measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.  

 The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

 All-In Sustaining Costs   

 Newmont has developed a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations.  

 Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.  

 All-in sustaining cost (“AISC”) amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development (i.e. non-sustaining) activities based upon each company’s internal policies.  

 The following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure:  

 Costs applicable to sales. Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from Costs applicable to sales (“CAS”), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of other metals at our Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines. The other metals CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines is based upon the relative sales value of gold and other metals produced during the period.  

 Reclamation costs. Includes accretion expense related to reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related Asset Retirement Cost (“ARC”) for the Company’s operating properties. Accretion related to the reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines.  

 Advanced projects, research and development and exploration. Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations. As these costs relate to sustaining our production, and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations less incurred expenses related to the development of new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines.  

 General and administrative. Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfill our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis.  

 Care and maintenance and Other expense, net. Care and maintenance primarily includes direct operating costs incurred at the mine sites during the period that these sites were temporarily placed into care and maintenance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For Other expense, net we exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders as disclosed in the Company’s non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines.  

 Treatment and refining costs. Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of Sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines.  

 Sustaining capital and finance lease payments. We determined sustaining capital and finance lease payments as those capital expenditures and finance lease payments that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. We determined development (i.e. non-sustaining) capital expenditures and finance lease payments to be those payments used to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations where those projects will materially benefit the operation and are excluded from the calculation of AISC. The classification of sustaining and development capital projects and finance leases is based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital and finance lease payments are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company’s current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines.

 Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio  

 Management uses net debt to Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA represents the ratio of the Company’s debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, to Adjusted EBITDA. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA measure is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that net debt to Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management’s determination of the components of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted EBITDA as follows:  

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Net average realized price per ounce/ pound  

 Average realized price per ounce/ pound are non-GAAP financial measures. The measures are calculated by dividing the net consolidated gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc sales by the consolidated gold ounces, copper pounds, silver ounces, lead pounds and zinc pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Average realized price per ounce/ pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only, do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

 Gold by-product metrics   

 Copper, silver, lead and zinc are by-products often obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. In our GAAP Consolidated Financial Statements, the value of these by-products is recorded as a credit to our CAS and the value of the primary ore is recorded as Sales. In certain instances, copper, silver, lead and zinc are co-products, or a significant resource in the primary ore-body, and the revenue is recorded as Sales in our GAAP Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Gold by-product metrics are non-GAAP financial measures that serve as a basis for comparing the Company’s performance with certain competitors. As Newmont’s operations are primarily focused on gold production, “Gold by-product metrics” were developed to allow investors to view Sales, CAS per ounce and AISC per ounce calculations that classify all copper, silver, lead and zinc production as a by-product, even when copper, silver, lead or zinc is a significant resource in the primary ore-body. These metrics are calculated by subtracting copper, silver, lead and zinc sales recognized from Sales and including these amounts as offsets to CAS.  

 Gold by-product metrics are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. These metrics are intended to provide supplemental information only, do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks, such as in IFRS.

Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition; and often contain words such as “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “would,” “estimate,” “expect,” “believe,” “target,” “indicative,” “preliminary,” or “potential.” Forward-looking statements in this news release may include, without limitation, (i) estimates of future production and sales, including production outlook, average future production, upside potential and indicative production profiles; (ii) estimates of future costs applicable to sales and all-in sustaining costs; (iii) estimates of future capital expenditures, including development and sustaining capital; (iv) estimates of future cost reductions, full potential savings, value creation, improvements, synergies and efficiencies; (v) expectations regarding the development, growth and exploration potential of the Company’s other operations, projects and investments, including, without limitation, returns, IRR, schedule, decision dates, mine life and mine life extensions, commercial start, first production, average production, average costs, impacts of improvement or expansion projects and upside potential; (vi) expectations regarding future investments or divestitures; (vii) expectations regarding free cash flow, and returns to stockholders, including with respect to future dividends and future share repurchases; (viii) expectations regarding future mineralization, including, without limitation, expectations regarding reserves and recoveries; (ix) estimates of future closure costs and liabilities; (x) expectations regarding the timing and/or likelihood of future borrowing, future debt repayment, financial flexibility and cash flow; (xi) expectations regarding spending in connection with climate change and other initiatives; and (xii) expectations regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine. Estimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. Such assumptions, include, but are not limited to: (i) there being no significant change to current geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological and other physical conditions; (ii) permitting, development, operations and expansion of operations and projects being consistent with current expectations and mine plans, including, without limitation, receipt of export approvals; (iii) political developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations; (iv) certain exchange rate assumptions being approximately consistent with current levels; (v) certain price assumptions for gold, copper, silver, zinc, lead and oil; (vi) prices for key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels; (vii) the accuracy of current mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates; and (viii) other planning assumptions. Uncertainties relating to the impacts of COVID-19, include, without limitation, general macroeconomic uncertainty and changing market conditions, changing restrictions on the mining industry in the jurisdictions in which we operate, the ability to operate following changing governmental restrictions on travel and operations (including, without limitation, the duration of restrictions, including access to sites, ability to transport and ship doré, access to processing and refinery facilities, impacts to international trade, impacts to supply chain, including price, availability of goods, ability to receive supplies and fuel, impacts to productivity and operations in connection with decisions intended to protect the health and safety of the workforce, their families and neighboring communities), and the impact of additional waves of the pandemic or increases of incidents of COVID-19 in the areas and countries in which we operate. Investors are reminded that only the fourth quarter has been declared by the Board of Directors at this time. Dividends for 2021 have not yet been approved or declared by the Board of Directors, and an annualized dividend payout or dividend yield has not been declared by the Board.. Management’s expectations with respect to future dividends are “forward-looking statements” and the Company’s dividend framework is non-binding. The declaration and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be determined based on Newmont’s financial results, balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity requirements, future prospects, gold and commodity prices, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Investors are also cautioned that the extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including trading volume, market conditions, legal requirements, business conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be discontinued at any time, and the program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock or to repurchase the full $1.0 billion amount during the authorization period. Consequently, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate such share repurchase authorization in the future. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors that might impact future looking statements, see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), under the heading “Risk Factors", filed with the SEC, available on the SEC website or www.newmont.com. The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly revisions to any “forward-looking statement,” including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued “forward-looking statement” constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on “forward-looking statements” is at investors’ own risk.  

 Notice for U.S. Investors:  

 The terms “resources” and “Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources” are used in this news release. Investors are advised that the SEC does not recognize these terms and “resources” have not been prepared in accordance with Industry Guide 7. Newmont has determined that such “resources” would be substantively the same as those prepared using the Guidelines established by the Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration (SME) and defined as “Mineral Resource”. Estimates of resources are subject to further exploration and development, are subject to additional risks, and no assurance can be given that they will eventually convert to future reserves. Inferred Resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the Inferred Resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. Investors are reminded that even if significant mineralization is discovered and converted to reserves, during the time necessary to ultimately move such mineralization to production the economic feasibility of production may change. US investors are encouraged to refer to the “Proven and Probable Reserve” tables contained herein for reserves prepared in compliance with the SEC’s Industry Guide 7 and “Mineralized Material” tables, available at www.newmont.com and included in the Company’s Form 10-K, expected to be filed on or about February 18, 2021, on www.sec.gov. Additional information on the Company’s resource estimates can be found at www.newmont.com/operations-and-projects/reserves-and-resources.
