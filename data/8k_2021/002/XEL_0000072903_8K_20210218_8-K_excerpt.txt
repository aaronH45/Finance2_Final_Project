 Item 2.03  

Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant  

On February 18, 2021, Xcel Energy Inc. (“Xcel Energy”) entered into a $1.2 billion 364-Day Term Loan Agreement (the “Term Loan Facility”) with U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent, and the several lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”), and Xcel Energy borrowed $1.2 billion under the Term Loan Facility to finance general corporate operations.  

The Term Loan Facility is unsecured and has a term of 364-days, ending on February 17, 2022, and can be extended for one additional 364-day period to February 16, 2023 at Xcel Energy’s request and the Lenders’ sole discretion.  

Loans under the Term Loan Facility shall bear interest at a rate equal to either (i) the Eurodollar rate, plus a margin equal to 60.0 basis points or (ii) an alternate base rate. The Term Loan Facility has one financial covenant requiring that Xcel Energy’s consolidated funded debt to total capitalization ratio be less than or equal to 65 percent. The Term Loan Facility also contains standard covenants with regards to mergers and consolidations and asset sales, and is subject to acceleration upon various events of default including, failure to observe certain stated covenants under the Term Loan Facility and certain bankruptcy related events.  

The foregoing summary of the Term Loan Facility does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Term Loan Facility, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.01 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
