Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow (DCF) are non-GAAP measures 43 Adjusted EBITDA is calculated using net income, the most comparable GAAP measure and adding back expenses for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also includes an adjustment for DTE’s proportional share of joint venture net income, excluding taxes and depreciation. DCF is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less pre-tax interest expense, maintenance capital investment and cash taxes. For GSP, DTE Energy management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful disclosure to investors as it is more commonly used as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors in the Midstream industry. DCF is used in the calculation of dividend coverage ratios, which DTE Energy management believes is another meaningful performance measurement to disclose to Midstream analysts and investors. Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA or DCF as projected for full-year 2020 is not provided. We do not forecast net income as we cannot, without unreasonable efforts, estimate or predict with certainty the components of net income. These components, net of tax, may include, but are not limited to, impairments of assets and other charges, divesture costs, acquisition costs, or changes in accounting principles. All of these components could significantly impact such financial measures. At this time, management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact, if any, of these items on future period reported earnings. Accordingly, we are not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for Adjusted EBITDA or DCF.  

Reconciliation of reported to operating earnings (non-GAAP) 44 Use of Operating Earnings Information – Operating earnings exclude non-recurring items, certain mark-to-market adjustments and discontinued operations. DTE Energy management believes that operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company’s earnings from ongoing operations and uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DTE Energy uses operating earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the Board of Directors. In this presentation, DTE Energy provides guidance for future period operating earnings. It is likely that certain items that impact the company’s future period reported results will be excluded from operating results. A reconciliation to the comparable future period reported earnings is not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items (i.e. future non-recurring items, certain mark-to-market adjustments and discontinued operations). These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.
