Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

Attached as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of a press release of The Coca-Cola Company (the "Company"), dated February 10, 2021, reporting the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. The information in this Item 2.02, including the Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Item 8.01. Other Events.

Attached as Exhibit 99.2 is an update to the information regarding tax audits that was included in Note 8: Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 25, 2020, filed on October 22, 2020 (the "Form 10-Q") and incorporated by reference herein. 

The Company is also providing the following updates to the Risk Factors set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, as updated by the Form 10-Q:

Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

We are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates and the geographic mix of our income before taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix, or foreign exchange rates could reduce our after-tax income. Our annual tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate including the impact of applicable income tax treaties. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for which the statute of limitations is open. 

For instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income for tax years 2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a potential additional U.S. federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for that period, plus interest. The Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and is pursuing, and will continue to pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its position. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion (the "Opinion") predominantly siding with the IRS. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position, considering all avenues of appeal, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Company's favor. It is therefore possible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinion could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would be subject to significant additional liabilities for the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years if the unfavorable portions of the Opinion were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope of the Opinion. Moreover, the IRS could successfully appeal the portions of the Opinion that are favorable to the Company and/or assert new claims for additional tax relating to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees. These adjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Any such adjustments related to years prior to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may have an impact on the transition tax payable as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
