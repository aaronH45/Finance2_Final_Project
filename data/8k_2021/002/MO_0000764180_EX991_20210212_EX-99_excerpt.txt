RICHMOND, Va., February 16, 2021 – Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”) (NYSE: MO) today announced the early results of its previously announced cash tender offers for certain of its outstanding senior unsecured notes (each, a “Tender Offer” and collectively, the “Tender Offers”) and that it is amending the Tender Offers by (i) increasing the Pool 1 Maximum Amount (as defined below) from $500,000,000 to an amount sufficient to purchase all of the Pool 1 Notes (as defined below) that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date (as defined below), (ii) increasing the Pool 2 Maximum Amount (as defined below) from $1,000,000,000 to an amount sufficient to purchase all of the Pool 2 Notes (as defined below) that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date, (iii) increasing the Pool 4 Maximum Amount (as defined below) from $1,200,000,000 to $1,300,000,000 and (iv) increasing the Aggregate Maximum Amount (as defined below) from $3,650,000,000 to an amount equal to the sum of the Maximum Amounts (as defined below), as amended.  

Tender Offers 

As amended, the Tender Offers consist of cash tender offers by Altria to purchase (i) up to an amount that is sufficient (the “Pool 1 Maximum Amount”) to allow Altria to accept for purchase all of its 2.850% Notes due 2022 and 2.950% Notes due 2023 (collectively, the “Pool 1 Notes”) that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date (collectively, the “Pool 1 Tender Offers”), (ii) up to an amount that is sufficient (the “Pool 2 Maximum Amount”) to allow Altria to accept for purchase all of its 4.000% Notes due 2024 and 3.800% Notes due 2024 (collectively, the “Pool 2 Notes”) that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date (collectively, the “Pool 2 Tender Offers”), (iii) up to $500,000,000 aggregate purchase price (the “Pool 3 Maximum Amount”) in respect of its 4.400% Notes due 2026, 2.625% Notes due 2026 and 2.350% Notes due 2025 (collectively, the “Pool 3 Notes”) that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date in the priorities set forth in the table below (collectively, the “Pool 3 Tender Offers”), (iv) up to $1,300,000,000 aggregate purchase price (the “Pool 4 Maximum Amount”) in respect of its 4.800% Notes due 2029 (the “Pool 4 Notes”) that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date in the priority set forth in the table below (the “Pool 4 Tender Offer”) and (v) up to $450,000,000 aggregate purchase price (the “Pool 5 Maximum Amount” and, together with the Pool 1 Maximum Amount, the Pool 2 Maximum Amount, the Pool 3 Maximum Amount and the Pool 4 Maximum Amount, the “Maximum Amounts”) in respect of its 9.950% Notes due 2038, 10.200% Notes due 2039, 6.200% Notes due 2059, 5.800% Notes due 2039, 5.375% Notes due 2044 and 5.950% Notes due 2049 (collectively, the “Pool 5 Notes” and, together with the Pool 1 Notes, the Pool 2 Notes, the Pool 3 Notes and the Pool 4 Notes, the “Notes”) that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date in the priorities set forth in the table below (collectively, the “Pool 5 Tender Offers” and, together with the Pool 1 Tender Offers, the Pool 2 Tender Offers, the Pool 3 Tender Offers and the Pool 4 Tender Offer, the “Capped Tender Offers” and each a “Capped Tender Offer”). The sum of the Maximum Amounts (the “Aggregate Maximum Amount”) represents the maximum aggregate purchase price in respect of the Notes subject to the Tender Offers and excludes any Accrued Interest (as defined below).   

As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 12, 2021 (the “Early Tender Date”), as reported by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the principal amounts of the Notes listed in the table below have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. The withdrawal deadline of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 12, 2021 has passed and, accordingly, Notes validly tendered in the Tender Offers may no longer be withdrawn.  

Except as amended hereby, the Tender Offers are being made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated February 1, 2021 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer to Purchase”), which sets forth a detailed description of the Tender Offers. The Tender Offers are open to all registered holders (individually, a “Holder” and collectively, the “Holders”) of the Notes. Copies of the Offer to Purchase are available to Holders through the Depositary and Information Agent for the Tender Offers, Global Bondholder Services Corporation, by email at contact@gbsc-usa.com or by phone (212) 430-3774 (for banks and brokers) and at the following web address: https://gbsc-usa.com/registration/altria/.  

The Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on Monday, March 1, 2021, unless extended or earlier terminated by Altria.  

The Tender Offers are summarized in the table below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  

Subject to the Aggregate Maximum Amount, the Maximum Amounts and proration, the principal amount of each series of Notes that is purchased in each of the Tender Offers will be determined in accordance with the applicable acceptance priority level (in numerical priority order) specified in this column.  

 (2)   

Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase.  

 (3)   

The Maximum Amount for each pool of Notes represents the maximum aggregate purchase price payable in respect of such pool of Notes that will be purchased in the Tender Offers.  

 (4)   

Reflects the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date.  

2   

Holders of all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase are eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration, which includes the early tender payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date. In addition to the applicable Total Consideration, Holders of Notes accepted for purchase will receive accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date (“Accrued Interest”).  

The applicable Total Consideration payable by Altria for the Notes (the “Total Consideration”) will be a price per $1,000 principal amount intended to result in a yield to maturity or par call date, as the case may be, equal to the yield to maturity of the U.S. Treasury reference securities specified in the table above (the “UST Reference Security”), as determined at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on February 16, 2021, plus a fixed spread, calculated in accordance with the Offer to Purchase (the “Tender Offer Yield”). For the avoidance of doubt, for the Notes that have par call dates, if the applicable Tender Offer Yield as determined in accordance with the Offer to Purchase is less than the contractual annual rate of interest, then such Total Consideration will be calculated based on the par call date; if the applicable Tender Offer Yield as determined in accordance with the Offer to Purchase is higher than or equal to the contractual annual rate of interest, then such Total Consideration will be calculated based on the maturity date.  

Altria expects to purchase the Maximum Amount in respect of each Capped Tender Offer and accept and make payment for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date on February 18, 2021 (the “Early Settlement Date”), subject to the respective acceptance priority levels for each Capped Tender Offer as described in the Offer to Purchase and, in the case of the 4.400% Notes due 2026 for the Pool 3 Tender Offers, in the case of the 4.800% Notes due 2029 for the Pool 4 Tender Offer and in the case of the 6.200% Notes due 2059 for the Pool 5 Tender Offers, subject to proration as described below.  

Because the aggregate purchase price in respect of Pool 3 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date would exceed the Pool 3 Maximum Amount, Altria expects that it will accept (i) validly tendered 4.400% Notes due 2026 on a prorated basis and (ii) none of the validly tendered 2.625% Notes due 2026 and 2.350% Notes due 2025. Because the aggregate purchase price in respect of Pool 4 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date would exceed the Pool 4 Maximum Amount, Altria expects that it will accept validly tendered 4.800% Notes due 2029 on a prorated basis. Because the aggregate purchase price in respect of Pool 5 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date would exceed the Pool 5 Maximum Amount, Altria expects that it will accept (i) all of the validly tendered 9.950% Notes due 2038 and 10.200% Notes due 2039, (ii) validly tendered 6.200% Notes due 2059 on a prorated basis and (iii) none of the validly tendered 5.800% Notes due 2039, 5.375% Notes due 2044 and 5.950% Notes due 2049.  

Altria expects to accept for purchase the Aggregate Maximum Amount of Notes on the Early Settlement Date and does not expect to purchase additional Notes after the Early Settlement Date. As described in the Offer to Purchase, Notes tendered and not accepted for purchase will be promptly returned to the tendering Holder’s account.  

The Tender Offers are not conditioned on any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered, but the Tender Offers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as described in the Offer to Purchase. Each Tender Offer is a separate offer. None of the Tender Offers is conditioned on any other. Each Tender Offer may be individually amended, extended or terminated by Altria.  

3   

Altria expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the Tender Offers at any time prior to the Expiration Date and/or to increase or decrease the Aggregate Maximum Amount and/or the Maximum Amounts without extending withdrawal rights, subject to compliance with applicable law. If Holders tender more Notes in the Tender Offers than they expect to be accepted for purchase by Altria based on the Aggregate Maximum Amount and/or the Maximum Amounts and Altria subsequently accepts more than such Holders expected of such Notes tendered as a result of a change, increase or decrease of the Aggregate Maximum Amount and/or the Maximum Amounts, such Holders will not be able to withdraw any of their previously tendered Notes. Accordingly, Holders should not tender any Notes that they do not wish to be accepted for purchase.  

Notes Issuance 

On February 4, 2021, Altria completed an underwritten public offering of senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to satisfy the financing condition described in the Offer to Purchase.
