Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. 

Prologis, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) expects that it will close the issuance and sale of the Notes (defined below) on February 19, 2021. The information under Item 8.01 is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 8.01 Other Events. 

On February 4, 2021, the Operating Partnership priced an offering of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.625% Notes due 2031 (the “Notes”). In connection with the offering, the Operating Partnership entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated February 4, 2021 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), with BofA Securities, Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and the other underwriters named in Schedule A thereto (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Operating Partnership agreed to sell and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth therein. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference. 

The Notes are being issued under an indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011 (the “Base Indenture”), among Prologis, Inc. (the “Parent”), the Operating Partnership and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture, dated as of August 15, 2013 (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture, the “Indenture”). 

The net proceeds to the Operating Partnership from the sale of the Notes, after the Underwriter’s discount and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately $395 million. The Operating Partnership intends to apply all or a portion of the amounts received from the offering of the Notes to redeem its 3.750% notes due 2025. The Operating Partnership may also use a portion of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to repay or repurchase other indebtedness. 

The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.625% per annum and mature on March 15, 2031. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership. 

The Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Operating Partnership, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed that would be due if such Notes matured on December 15, 2031 (the “Par Call Date”) (in each case exclusive of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the then current Treasury Rate plus 10 basis points. In addition, on or after the Par Call Date, the Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Operating Partnership’s option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed. In each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid on the Notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date. 

The Indenture governing the Notes restricts, among other things, the Operating Partnership’s and its subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness and to merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its assets. 

The Notes are being issued pursuant to the Registration Statement (File No. 333- 237366) that the Operating Partnership and Parent filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Operating Partnership and Parent pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with filing with the SEC a definitive prospectus supplement, dated February 4, 2021, and base prospectus, dated March 24, 2020, relating to the public offering of the Notes, the Operating Partnership is filing the Underwriting Agreement, the form of the Notes and certain other exhibits with this Current Report on Form 8-K as exhibits to such Registration Statement. See “Item 9.01 – Financial Statements and Exhibits.” 

This Current Report does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. 

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
