(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On February 16, 2021, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of McDonald's Corporation (the “Company”) approved the payout structure for the 2021 Target Incentive Plan (“TIP”) awards for executives.

The target 2021 TIP awards for the Company’s executives for whom disclosure was required in the Company’s most recent proxy statement are as shown in the table below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

TIP payouts will be primarily determined by the Company's 2021 performance on two key financial performance metrics: operating income and Systemwide sales (which include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees). Each of these metrics is a critical driver of the Company’s success. Operating income is a key component of the Company’s strategy because it requires the Company to balance increases in revenue with financial discipline to produce strong margins and Systemwide sales is important in our franchise model because income generation is closely correlated to sales growth. Systemwide sales is also a good measure of franchisee health given our large percentage of franchised restaurants.

Each of these metrics are measured on a consolidated or business segment level basis, as applicable to each individual. For Messrs. Kempczinski and Ozan, the payout will be based on consolidated performance. For Mr. Erlinger, the payout will be based on a combination of the performance of McDonald's USA and consolidated performance, and for Mr. Borden, the payout will be based on a combination of the performance of McDonald’s international markets and consolidated performance.

In addition to the above financial metrics, 2021 TIP payouts to the executives listed above will also include metrics that measure the Company’s success in certain aspects of human capital management. In addition to strong financial performance, the Company believes it is important to hold executives accountable for making progress in diversity, equity and inclusion.

Therefore, for 2021 TIP, executives will be measured on four quantitative metrics related to championing the Company’s core values, improving diversity representation for women and underrepresented groups, and creating a strong culture of inclusion among employees.

The 2021 STIP metrics will be operating income growth (42.5%), systemwide sales growth (42.5%) and human capital metrics (15%). The maximum 2021 TIP award that any of the above individuals can earn is 200% of the target award.

For compensation purposes, performance results may be adjusted from those reported in our financial statements in order to focus our executives on the fundamentals of the Company’s underlying business performance. Any adjustments are considered by the Committee pursuant to pre-established guidelines, including materiality. For example, results are expressed in constant currencies to neutralize the impact of foreign currency translation.

In addition, to better align his compensation both internally and relative to comparable roles within our peer group, the Committee approved a base salary for Mr. Borden of CAD $1,045,000, effective March 1, 2021.
