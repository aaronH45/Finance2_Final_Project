Western Union Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results

​

Q4 Revenue of $1.3 billion, GAAP EPS $0.43, Adjusted EPS $0.45

Company achieves all-time highs for money transfer transactions and principal in 2020, with 38% growth for digital revenues

Company provides 2021 financial outlook, including margin expansion and solid revenue growth

Share repurchases resume in the first quarter of 2021 along with a 4% increase in the quarterly dividend

​

DENVER, February 10, 2021: The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU), a global leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement and payments, today reported fourth quarter and full year financial results for 2020 and provided a financial outlook for 2021.

​

The Company’s fourth quarter revenue of $1.3 billion declined 3% compared to the prior year period, or 1% on a constant currency basis that includes a 1% benefit from inflation in Argentina. The decline in revenue reflected the ongoing macro-economic impact from COVID-19, partially offset by strength in digital money transfer which grew 36% to a new quarterly high of $240 million.

​

GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.43 compared to $0.32 in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.45 compared to $0.38 in the prior year period, with declines in revenue more than offset by a lower effective tax rate, productivity and cost savings, and lower share count.

​

The Company increased its quarterly dividend by 4% to $0.235 per common share, payable March 31, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2021.

​

President and CEO Hikmet Ersek said, “2020 was an unprecedented year for the global community and Western Union, and I am proud of how we responded to a range of COVID-19 challenges and ensured our services were available for customers to provide critical economic support to loved ones and communities around the world. We applaud the heroic efforts of our customers, many of whom have worked on the front lines in essential services of host communities during this crisis, while selflessly contributing to improved quality of life in home nations.”

​

Ersek added, “The strong underlying fundamentals of our business really stood out this year, as we quickly began to rebound from an early, historic economic shock, finished with solid fourth quarter momentum, and still generated strong full year margins and cash flow. Despite the disruption from the pandemic, we remained highly focused on our growth strategy, driving exceptional results in our digital business and building the foundation for our future. As we begin 2021, uncertainty remains elevated but we are optimistic that business will continue to improve gradually, with expectations that our digital revenues will reach approximately $1 billion in 2021. In addition, we have a compelling strategic agenda that should position us to expand our offerings and markets to drive profitable, long-term growth that we believe will create value for shareholders.”

​

CFO Raj Agrawal stated, “We delivered solid results again in the fourth quarter, which contributed to full year 2020 results that met or exceeded the financial outlook we reinstituted with third quarter results in October. I am pleased to say that the resilience of our business, coupled with prudent management of costs and capital, enabled us to achieve the 21% adjusted margin we initially targeted for 2020, generate $878 million of operating cash flow, return $587 million of cash to shareholders, and continue to invest to drive our strategy forward. In summary, we had very strong financial performance despite a historic economic disruption. Assuming no further macro-economic setbacks, we expect the business will continue to improve in 2021 and are issuing a full year financial outlook that includes mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth and EPS in a range of $2.00 to $2.10.”

​

Q4 Business Highlights

​

●Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) transactions increased 6% in the quarter, while revenues were flat on both a reported and constant currency basis. C2C revenues represented 88% of total Company revenue in the quarter. Within the C2C segment, cross-border money transfer revenues grew 2% and were offset by declines in domestic money transfers. Transaction growth was led by Europe and CIS, U.S. outbound, and the Middle East, partially offset by declines in U.S. domestic money transfer and Latin America and the Caribbean. 

​

●Digital money transfer revenues increased 36% on a reported basis in the quarter, or 35% constant currency, and represented 21% and 32% of total C2C revenues and transactions, respectively. Digital money transfer reached new quarterly highs for transactions, principal, and revenues in the current year period. Westernunion.com revenue grew 27% on a reported basis and 26% constant currency, including cross-border revenue growth of 38%. 

​

●Westernunion.com average monthly active customers for the fourth quarter increased 49% year-over-year. Westernunion.com was the most downloaded mobile app among peer money transfer companies during the fourth quarter, according to data provided by mobile app marketing firm Sensor Tower

1. Westernunion.com service is available in over 75 countries and territories. Account payout is available in approximately

120 countries, with real-time capabilities to select bank accounts and digital wallets in approximately 100 countries, and retail payout in over 200 countries and territories. 

​

●Western Union Business Solutions revenues declined 8% on a reported basis, or 11% constant currency, primarily due to the ongoing macro-economic impact of COVID-19 on travel and tourism, small and medium-sized enterprises, and education, along with decreased cross-border trade more broadly. Other revenues, which consists primarily of retail bill payments in the U.S. and Argentina, as well as money orders, declined 29% primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and the depreciation of the Argentine peso. Business Solutions and Other represented 7% and 5%, respectively, of total Company revenue.  

​

Additional Q4 Financial Highlights

​

●GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 17.9% compared to 17.3% in the prior year period, with the increase primarily driven by productivity and cost savings, the timing of marketing investments, partially offset by declines in revenue. Adjusted operating margin was 18.8% compared to 18.7% in the prior year period with the increase driven by the same factors noted above and adjusted for restructuring expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs.

​

●The GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 11.0% compared to 31.4% in the prior year period, and the adjusted tax rate was 11.6% in the quarter compared to 24.5% in the prior year period. The decreases in the Company’s GAAP and adjusted effective tax rates compared to the prior year period were primarily due to higher prior period domestic pre-tax income associated with the sales of the Speedpay and Paymap businesses, prior period one-time settlements in certain geographies, and discrete tax benefits in the current period.

​

●The Company paid $93 million in dividends and did not repurchase shares during the fourth quarter. The Company has resumed share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021.

​

2020 Full Year Financial Highlights

​

●The Company’s full year revenue of $4.8 billion declined 9% compared to the prior year, or 3% on an adjusted constant currency basis that includes a 1% benefit from inflation in Argentina. The decline in reported revenue was largely driven by the macro-economic impact of COVID-19, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the divestitures of Speedpay and Paymap, partially offset by strength in digital money transfer revenue which grew 38% compared to the prior year and surpassed $850 million. The decline in adjusted constant currency revenue was largely driven by the macro-economic impact of COVID-19, partially offset by strength in digital money transfer.

​

●GAAP operating margin was 20.0% compared to 17.6% in the prior year. The increase in GAAP operating margin was attributable to productivity and cost savings and lower restructuring expenses, partially offset by lower revenues. Adjusted operating margin was 20.8% compared to 20.1% in the prior year with margin expansion driven by the same factors noted above and adjusted for restructuring expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs.

​

●The GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 12.9% compared to 19.9% in the prior year, and the adjusted tax rate was 13.0% compared to 19.7% in 2019. The decreases in the GAAP and adjusted effective tax rates were primarily due to higher prior period domestic pre-tax income associated with the sales of the Speedpay and Paymap businesses, prior period one-time settlements in certain geographies, and discrete tax benefits in the current year.

​

●GAAP earnings per share was $1.79 compared to $2.46 in 2019. The decrease in earnings per share was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Speedpay business in 2019 and declines in revenue in 2020, partially offset by productivity and cost savings, a lower effective tax rate, and lower restructuring expenses.

​

●Adjusted earnings per share was $1.87 compared to $1.73 in 2019. The increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to productivity and cost savings, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower revenues.

​

●GAAP cash flow from operating activities for the year was $878 million. The Company returned $587 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases for the full year.

​

2021 Outlook

​

The Company expects the following financial outlook for full year 2021, which assumes no material worsening in macro-economic conditions or the COVID-19 pandemic. While we expect solid full-year results, we anticipate quarterly variability in year-over-year growth rates as we cycle through the impact that COVID-19 had on the business last year:

​

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

​

​

Adjustment Items

​

Adjusted constant currency revenue metrics for 2020 exclude revenues for the Speedpay and Paymap businesses in the prior year period, each of which was divested in May 2019. Adjusted operating profit, tax rate, and earnings per share metrics for 2020 periods exclude restructuring expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs, net of related taxes, as applicable.

​

Adjusted constant currency revenue metrics for 2019 exclude revenues for the Speedpay and Paymap businesses. Adjusted operating profit metrics for 2019 periods exclude restructuring expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs. Adjusted tax rate and earnings per share metrics for 2019 periods exclude the impact of the net gain on the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures, restructuring expenses, and acquisition and divestiture costs. Restructuring expenses are not included in operating segment results.

​

Although the Company has previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur restructuring costs in the future, these expenses are specific to the implementation of the Global Strategy initiative and the Company has therefore provided adjusted financial results that exclude these expenses.

​

Additional Statistics

​

Additional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental tables included with this press release. 

​

All amounts included in the supplemental tables to this press release are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, the percentage changes and margins disclosed herein may not recalculate precisely using the rounded amounts provided. 

​

​

Non-GAAP Measures

​

Western Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year.

​

Reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the “Investor Relations” section of the Company’s website at https://ir.westernunion.com.

In the first quarter of 2020, we changed our expense allocation method so that our corporate data center and network engineering information technology expenses are allocated based on a percentage of relative revenue. In 2019, these costs had been allocated based in part on a percentage of relative transactions. We believe that an allocation method based fully on relative revenue presents a more representative view of segment profitability, as certain of our services, particularly some of our bill payment services and our money order services, have much lower revenues per transaction than our other services. Further, these technology expenses are becoming increasingly based on data storage utilized and less based on the number of transactions processed. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, this change would have decreased Consumer-to-Consumer and increased Other operating income by $11.8 million and $49.6 million, respectively. Business Solutions was not materially impacted by the change in the allocation method.

Western Union’s management believes the non-GAAP financial measures presented provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results to assist management, investors, analysts, and others in understanding our financial results and to better analyze trends in our underlying business because they provide consistency and comparability to prior periods. We have also included non-GAAP revenues that remove the impact of Speedpay and Paymap in order to provide a more meaningful comparison of results from continuing operations.

A non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below, where not previously reconciled above.

Non-GAAP related notes:

(j)Represents the impact from the fluctuation in exchange rates between all foreign currency denominated amounts and the United States dollar. Constant currency results exclude any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with information about revenue results and trends that eliminates currency volatility while increasing the comparability of our underlying results and trends.

(k)On May 9, 2019, we completed the sale of our United States electronic bill payments business known as “Speedpay” to ACI Worldwide Corp. and ACW Worldwide, Inc. ("ACI") for approximately $750 million in cash. In addition, on May 6, 2019, we completed the sale of Paymap Inc. ("Paymap"), which provides electronic mortgage bill payment services, for contingent consideration and immaterial cash proceeds received at closing. Both Speedpay and Paymap were included as a component of "Other" in our segment reporting. Revenue has been adjusted to exclude the carved out financial information for Speedpay and Paymap and the gain on the sales and the income taxes on the gain, including the elimination of previously forecasted annual base-erosion anti-abuse taxes, has been removed from adjusted effective tax rate. These financial measures are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measures. We have included this information because management believes that presenting these measures as adjusted to exclude divestitures will provide investors with a more meaningful comparison of results within the periods presented. Additionally, Speedpay and Paymap contributions to operating income exclude corporate overhead allocations.

(l)Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”) results from taking operating income and adjusting for depreciation and amortization expenses. EBITDA results provide an additional performance measurement calculation which helps neutralize the operating income effect of assets acquired in prior periods.

(m)Represents impact from expenses incurred in connection with an overall restructuring plan, approved by the Board of Directors on August 1, 2019, to improve our business processes and cost structure by reducing headcount and consolidating various facilities. While certain of these expenses are identifiable to our business segments, primarily to our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, they have been excluded from the measurement of segment operating income provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. These expenses are therefore excluded from the Company's segment operating income results. While these expenses are specific to this initiative, the types of expenses related to this initiative are similar to expenses that we have previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future. We believe that, by excluding the effects of these charges that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of our underlying operating results.

(n)Represents the impact from expenses incurred in connection with our acquisition and divestiture activity, including the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures. We believe that, by excluding the effects of these charges that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of our underlying operating results.
