 Item 5.02  

Departure of Directors; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers  

(d) On February 25, 2021, the board of directors (the “Board”) of Lumen Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”), on the recommendation of its nominating and corporate governance committee, voted to increase its size from 11 members to 12 members and to appoint Quincy L. Allen to fill the newly-created vacancy. Mr. Allen’s appointment is effective immediately and, assuming his renomination by the Board, he will stand for reelection at the Company’s 2021 annual meeting of shareholders.  

The Board has determined that Mr. Allen qualifies as an independent director under the independence standards of the NYSE listing rules. Although Mr. Allen has not yet been appointed to serve on any Board committee, the Board expects to do so as part of its regular 2021 committee assessment and appointment process.  

Mr. Allen will participate in the Company’s outside director compensation program as previously described in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In addition, Mr. Allen is expected to execute and receive the benefit of the Company’s standard form of indemnification agreement for directors, a copy of which has been filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016.  

On February 25, 2021, the Company issued a press release announcing Mr. Allen’s appointment. That press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to, and is incorporated by reference into, this Current Report on Form 8-K.
