On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors of Lennar Corporation (the “Company”), upon the recommendation of the Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, elected Amy Banse to serve as a director for a term of office expiring at the Company’s 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, at which time her continued Board service will be subject to stockholder approval. Ms. Banse has not been assigned to any committees of the Board. 

Ms. Banse has served as senior adviser to the executive committee of Comcast Corporation, a global media and technology company (including Comcast Ventures, LLC, its venture capital arm), since September 2020. She previously served as executive vice president, Comcast Corporation, from January 2020 to September 2020 and as managing director and head of funds at Comcast Ventures LLC from August 2011 to September 2020. From 2005 to 2011, Ms. Banse was senior vice president, Comcast Corporation and president, Comcast Interactive Media, a division of Comcast responsible for developing online strategy and operating the company’s digital properties. Since joining Comcast in 1991, Ms. Banse has held various positions at the company, including content development, programming investments and overseeing the development and acquisition of Comcast’s cable network portfolio. Earlier in her career, Ms. Banse was an associate at Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP.

The Board has determined that Ms. Banse qualifies as independent under the independence standards set forth in the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. There are no arrangements or understandings between Ms. Banse and any other persons with respect to her appointment as a director. Neither Ms. Banse nor any immediate family member of Ms. Banse has been a participant in any transaction or currently proposed transaction with the Company that is reportable under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
