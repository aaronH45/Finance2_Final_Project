Strategic transformation delivers material free cash flow in 2021; Company to further reduce debt

SPRING, Texas – February 25, 2021...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and issued 2021 guidance. 

“In 2020, Southwestern Energy delivered on its commitments, exceeding expectations on all key metrics while navigating the uncertainties of a global pandemic and the associated challenging commodity price and operating environments. We have positioned the Company to deliver material free cash flow going forward through an enduring conviction to our returns-driven strategy. We delivered strong results across all of our strategic pillars, including an accretive acquisition, a meaningfully lower cost structure and an increased underlying asset value,” said Bill Way, Southwestern Energy President and Chief Executive Officer.

“Southwestern Energy has entered 2021 with greater scale and resilience, prepared to capture increasing value from more than one trillion cubic feet equivalent of expected annual production flowing into diverse and key markets. The free cash flow we expect to deliver this year will be used to reduce debt as we progress towards our goal of sustainable 2 times leverage. Consistent with our disciplined approach, any further improvement in cash flow from higher commodity prices will accelerate the delivery of that objective,” Way continued.

•Hedges in place for approximately 85%, 60% and 95% of expected natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production, respectively; approximately 80% of natural gas hedges allow for participation in upside from improving prices;

•Protecting 75% of natural gas basis through physical and financial basis hedges and out of basin transportation portfolio; expect financial basis hedge gain of $0.07 to $0.09 per Mcf; and

2020 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Capital investments on the cash flow statement include decreases of $5 million and $18 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a decrease of $3 million and an increase of $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, relating to the change in accrued expenditures between periods.

Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial Results

For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Southwestern Energy recorded a net loss of $92 million, or ($0.14) per diluted share, including $335 million of non-cash impairments and a $134 million non-cash gain on unsettled mark to market derivatives. This compares to net income of $110 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Adjusted net income (non-GAAP), which excludes non-cash items noted above and other one-time charges, was $119 million or $0.18 per diluted share in 2020 and $99 million or $0.18 per share for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily related to increased production volumes and a decrease in average unit operating costs, partially offset by wider natural gas basis differentials. For the fourth quarter of 2020, adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $276 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $121 million and net cash flow (non-GAAP) was $249 million, resulting in $55 million in free cash flow. 

As indicated in the table below, fourth quarter 2020 weighted average realized price, including $0.37 per Mcfe of transportation expenses, was $1.93 per Mcfe before the impact of derivatives, down 9% compared to $2.12 per Mcfe in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to widened basis differentials in the Appalachia basin. Fourth quarter weighted average realized price before transportation expense was $2.30 per Mcfe. 

The Company realized $52 million in cash-settled derivative gains during the fourth quarter of 2020, a $0.21 per Mcfe uplift. Included in the fourth quarter settled derivative gains is a $47 million gain related to natural gas basis hedges, which protected the Company from widening basis differentials.

Full Year 2020 Financial Results

The Company recorded a net loss of $3.1 billion, or ($5.42) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net income of $891 million, or $1.65 per share

in 2019. In 2020, the Company recorded non-cash impairments of $2.8 billion and $138 million of non-cash loss on unsettled derivatives, and had an $818 million change in its deferred tax provision. Excluding these non-cash and other one-time items, adjusted net income for 2020 was $221 million, or $0.38 per share, compared to $328 million, or $0.61 per share, in 2019. The decrease in adjusted net income compared to prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in commodity prices, partially offset by a $182 million increase in settled derivatives impact, increased production volumes and decreased G&A and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. In 2020, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $742 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $528 million and net cash flow (non-GAAP) was $662 million.

For the full year 2020, weighted average realized price, including $0.37 per Mcfe of transportation expense, was $1.53 per Mcfe before the impact of derivatives, a 30% decrease compared to $2.18 per Mcfe in 2019, due to decreased prices across all commodities. In 2020, the weighted average realized price before transportation expenses was $1.90 per Mcfe.

Cash-settled derivative gains totaled $362 million in 2020, a $0.41 per Mcfe uplift, bringing the weighted average realized price including the impact of derivatives to $1.94 per Mcfe in 2020, compared to $2.42 per Mcfe in 2019. 

As of December 31, 2020, Southwestern Energy had total debt of $3.15 billion and a cash balance of $13 million. At the end of 2020, the Company had $700 million of borrowings under its $2.0 billion revolving credit facility with $233 million in outstanding letters of credit.

2020 Proved Reserves

The Company reported total proved reserves of 12.0 Tcfe at year-end 2020, compared to 12.7 Tcfe in 2019. Reserves consisted of 76% natural gas and 24% liquids. During 2020, the Company reported 1.4 Tcfe of positive performance revisions related to increased well performance and lower operating costs, 741 Bcfe of reserve additions, and also acquired 2.4 Tcfe of reserves related to the acquisition of Montage Resources. The Company incurred 4.4 Tcfe of downward price revisions related to significantly reduced trailing 12-month SEC prices on all commodities. 

Lower SEC prices, which were $1.98 per Mcf NYMEX Henry Hub, $39.57 per Bbl WTI and $10.27 per Bbl NGLs, resulted in a PV-10 of $1.85 billion. Using 2021 strip prices as of January 4, 2021, which were $2.70 per Mcf NYMEX Henry Hub, $47.67 per Bbl WTI and $11.82 per Bbl NGLs, the PV-10 of the reported year-end 2020 reserves would increase to $5.85 billion, without consideration of any PV-10 increase from the expected higher reserve volumes at those prices.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results, the results of its peers and of prior periods. 

One such non-GAAP financial measure is net cash flow. Management presents this measure because (i) it is accepted as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt, (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the Company may not control and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred.

Additional non-GAAP financial measures the Company may present from time to time are net debt, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA, all which exclude certain charges or amounts. Management presents these measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the Company’s position and performance are measured relative to the position and performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the Company excludes information regarding these types of items. These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
