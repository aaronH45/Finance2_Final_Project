FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Franklin Resources, Inc. Announces First Quarter Results

San Mateo, CA, February 2, 2021 – Franklin Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) [NYSE: BEN] today announced net income1 of $345.3 million or $0.67 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $78.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share for the previous quarter, and $350.5 million or $0.70 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. Operating income2 was $409.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $103.6 million for the previous quarter and $372.9 million in the prior year.

As supplemental information, the Company is providing certain adjusted performance measures which are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles.3 Adjusted net income3 was $373.4 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.73 for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $291.0 million and $0.56 for the previous quarter, and $338.3 million and $0.67 for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted operating income3 was $549.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $428.9 million for the previous quarter and $405.5 million in the prior year.

“This month marks a full year since we announced our acquisition of Legg Mason and its specialist investment managers,” said Jenny Johnson, President and CEO of Franklin Resources, Inc. “I couldn’t be prouder of the progress we’ve made in bringing our teams together to form one company – with a singular focus on delivering exceptional client outcomes. The first full quarter of the combined company saw some encouraging trends, including a record high in AUM of approximately $1.5 trillion, driven primarily by strong market performance. In addition, the Company delivered strong operating and financial results. 

“Investment performance broadly improved this quarter. Western Asset continues to perform exceptionally well, while Brandywine performance rebounded strongly. In terms of mutual funds, several of our value-oriented equity strategies generated noteworthy results and we continue to see strong performance in U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income. On the distribution front, momentum continued to build with positive net flows into Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, ClearBridge, Fiduciary Trust, Franklin Equity Group, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, Martin Currie, Royce and Western Asset. Cross-selling initiatives have started to yield positive results as we effectively respond to client needs with expanded investment capabilities. 

“In addition to executing the Legg Mason acquisition, we continue to expand our offerings beyond traditional investment products and look for new, market-leading ways to serve our clients. Our proprietary Goals Optimization Engine (GOE), which launched last year, engages firms that are looking to digitally deliver a dynamic and personalized investment solution to investors. GOE is seeing early success in both the wealth and retirement segments. In the U.S., we recently announced the launch of a quick-deploy robo solution, as well as a partnership for a managed account solution within 401(k) plans – both of which are powered by GOE.

“Yesterday we officially launched our new Franklin Templeton Investment Institute, an innovative hub for research and knowledge sharing that we believe will unlock the Company’s competitive advantage as a source of global market insights. Stephen Dover, who will be taking on a new role as Chief Market Strategist, will be head of the newly-formed Investment Institute. At the same time, Terrence Murphy has expanded his leadership role to become Head of Equities for Franklin Templeton, while retaining his existing role as CEO at ClearBridge Investments.

“Our company and the value we deliver to our clients has evolved tremendously over the past 12 months. We’ve created a stronger firm that combines global strength and boutique specialization. All of this would not be possible without our incredible employees around the globe. I thank them for their efforts, dedication and client focus, especially given the ongoing unusual operating environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures

As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures for “adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” each of which is based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP measures”). Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful indicators of our financial performance and may be helpful to investors in evaluating our relative performance against industry peers as these measures exclude the impact of consolidated investment products (“CIPs”) and mitigate the margin variability related to sales and distribution revenues and expenses across multiple distribution channels globally. These measures also exclude performance-based investment management fees which are fully passed through as compensation and benefits expense per the terms of a previous acquisition by Legg Mason, Inc. (“Legg Mason”) and have no impact on net income. These non-GAAP measures also exclude acquisition-related expenses, certain items which management considers to be nonrecurring, unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net, and the related income tax effect of these adjustments, as applicable. These non-GAAP measures also exclude the impact on compensation and benefits expense which is offset by gains and losses in investment and other income (losses), net on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans and on seed investments under certain historical revenue sharing arrangements.

“Adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share” are defined below, followed by reconciliations of operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. and diluted earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis to these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, any financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate.

Adjusted Operating Income

We define adjusted operating income as operating income adjusted to exclude the following:

•Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.

•Acquisition-related retention compensation.

•Impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments related to Legg Mason deferred compensation plans and seed investments, which is offset in investment and other income (expense), net.

•Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration liabilities.

•Amortization and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill.

•Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of Legg Mason on July 31, 2020.

Adjusted Operating Margin

We calculate adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted operating revenues. We define adjusted operating revenues as operating revenues adjusted to exclude the following:

•Acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and benefits expense.

•Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees allocated to cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses paid to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf. 

•Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.

8

Adjusted Net Income

We define adjusted net income as net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. adjusted to exclude the following:

•Activities of CIPs, including investment and other income (losses), net, and income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment products.

•Acquisition-related retention compensation.

•Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration liabilities and the market-based component of retention awards.

•Amortization and impairment of intangible assets.

•Impairment of goodwill and write off of noncontrolling interests related to the wind down of a recently acquired business.

•Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of Legg Mason on July 31, 2020.

•Net gains or losses on investments related to Legg Mason deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense.

•Unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net, other than those that are offset by compensation and benefits expense.

•Interest expense for amortization of Legg Mason debt premium from acquisition-date fair value adjustment.

•Net income tax expense of the above adjustments based on the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share

We define adjusted diluted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the per-share impacts of the adjustments applied to net income in calculating adjusted net income.

In calculating adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, we adjust for activities of CIPs because the impact of consolidated products are not considered reflective of the underlying results of our operations. We adjust for acquisition-related retention compensation, other acquisition-related expenses, amortization and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, the write off of noncontrolling interests, and interest expense for amortization of the Legg Mason debt premium to facilitate comparability of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms. We adjust for special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of Legg Mason because these items are deemed nonrecurring. In calculating adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, we adjust for unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net and net gains or losses on investments related to Legg Mason deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense because these items primarily relate to seed and strategic investments which have been and are generally expected to be held long term.
