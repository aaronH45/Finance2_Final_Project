________________________________________________________________________________

CORK, Ireland, January 29, 2021 -- Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE: JCI), the global leader for smart, healthy and sustainable buildings, today reported fiscal first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) from continuing operations, including special items, of $0.45. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.43, up 8% versus the prior year period (see attached footnotes for non-GAAP reconciliation). 

Sales of $5.3 billion decreased 4% compared to the prior year and declined 5% organically, reflecting the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

GAAP net income from continuing operations was $327 million. Adjusted net income from continuing operations was $311 million, up 2% versus the prior year. Earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) was $492 million and EBIT margin was 9.2%. Adjusted EBIT was $471 million and adjusted EBIT margin was 8.8%, an increase of 80 basis points versus prior year results, despite the revenue decline.

“2021 is off to a strong start with solid financial performance in our fiscal first quarter, demonstrating our continued commitment to disciplined execution, in what remains a challenging market environment,” said George Oliver, chairman and CEO. “The continued benefits from our actions taken in fiscal 2020 to reduce structural costs, combined with ongoing efforts to minimize discretionary expenses, enabled us to achieve record first quarter profitability and free cash flow. Although many of our end markets remain under pressure due to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, we further advanced our strategic growth initiatives, with continued reinvestment in our businesses to ensure we are best positioned for the recovery. As we progress into the second quarter, we expect to return to organic revenue growth, with strong margin expansion and year-over-year growth in earnings per share.”

Mr. Oliver added, “Our OpenBlue digital technologies are reinventing the building landscape, creating dynamic smart facilities that help our customers meet their sustainability commitments, while delivering healthy places, enriched experiences and cost savings. Our vision for a healthy world centers on healthy buildings, which means delivering on the most critical elements to serve People, Places and the Planet. We believe we are uniquely positioned to lead the industry in translating new building technology capabilities into game-changing solutions that deliver on that vision."

In a separate press release issued today, Johnson Controls announced an ambitious set of new Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) commitments, science-based targets as well as a net zero carbon pledge to support a healthy, more sustainable planet over the next two decades.

“Our commitments reinforce the urgency to make positive changes that will improve the health of our planet, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to help customers and suppliers achieve their sustainability goals, in addition to our own,” said Katie McGinty, vice president & chief sustainability, government and regulatory affairs officer at Johnson Controls. “We are excited to step up the role we play and will continue to innovate and uncover new pathways to meet our goals which will contribute to healthier people, healthier places and a healthier planet.”

SEGMENT RESULTS

Building Solutions North America 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales in the quarter of $2.0 billion, decreased 6% versus the prior year. Organic sales also declined 6% versus the prior year, driven by a decline in project installations and, to a much lesser extent, service. Strong growth in Performance Solutions was more than offset by a decline in Fire & Security and HVAC & Controls.  

Orders in the quarter, excluding M&A and adjusted for foreign currency, decreased 7% year-over-year driven by lower demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Backlog at the end of the quarter of $5.9 billion increased 1% compared to the prior year, excluding M&A and adjusted for foreign currency.

Adjusted segment EBITA was $255 million, down 2% versus the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITA margin of 12.5% expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year driven by significant cost mitigation actions and restructuring benefits as well as positive mix, which more than offset the impact of the volume decline. 

Building Solutions EMEA/LA (Europe, Middle East, Africa/Latin America)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales in the quarter of $906 million decreased 2% versus the prior year. Organic sales declined 5% versus the prior year driven by a decline in project installations. Volumes declined across all regions and platforms.

Adjusted segment EBITA margin of 10.5% expanded 80 basis points over the prior year, including a 20 basis point headwind related to foreign currency.

Building Solutions Asia Pacific 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales in the quarter of $615 million decreased 2% versus the prior year. Organic sales declined 6% versus the prior year driven by a decline in project installations which more than offset growth in service. Although China continues to rebound, declines continue in certain other parts of the region. 

Orders in the quarter, excluding M&A and adjusted for foreign currency, decreased 1% year-over-year as growth in service was more than offset by a decline in project activity. Significantly improved demand in China was offset by further declines in Japan, Hong Kong and South East Asia. Backlog at the end of the quarter of $1.8 billion increased 12% year-over-year, excluding M&A and adjusted for foreign currency.

Adjusted segment EBITA was $79 million, up 10% versus the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITA margin of 12.8% expanded 140 basis points over the prior year as favorable mix and the benefit of mitigating cost actions more than offset the impact of the volume decline.

Global Products

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales in the quarter of $1.8 billion decreased 4% versus the prior year. Organic sales declined 2% versus the prior year as low double-digit growth in residential was more than offset by a decline in commercial HVAC, Fire & Security and Industrial Refrigeration. 

Adjusted segment EBITA was $213 million, up 4% versus the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITA margin of 11.9% expanded 90 basis points versus the prior year as positive price/cost and the benefit of mitigating cost actions more than offset the impact of the volume decline and negative mix.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Adjusted Corporate expense was $67 million in the quarter, a decrease of 17% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by mitigating cost actions and continuous structural cost reductions.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The adjusting items include restructuring and impairment costs, transaction costs, integration costs, net mark-to-market adjustments, Power Solutions divestiture reserve adjustment and discrete tax items. Financial information regarding organic sales, EBIT, EBIT margin, adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, total segment EBITA, adjusted segment EBITA, adjusted segment EBITA margin, adjusted corporate expense, free cash flow, and adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations are also presented, which are non-GAAP performance measures. Adjusted segment EBITA 

Page 7 of 15

excludes special items such as integration costs because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of its business units. Management believes that, when considered together with unadjusted amounts, these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results and business trends of the Company. Management may also use these metrics as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and for compensation purposes. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. For further information on the calculation of thee non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, refer to the attached footnotes.

FOOTNOTES

1. Financial Summary

The Company evaluates the performance of its business units primarily on segment earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA), which represents income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding general corporate expenses, intangible asset amortization, net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, and the net mark-to-market adjustments related to restricted asbestos investments and pension and postretirement plans. The financial results shown below are for continuing operations and exclude the Power Solutions business. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The Company's press release contains financial information regarding segment EBITA, adjusted segment EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA margins, which are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company's definition of adjusted segment EBITA excludes special items because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of its businesses. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company. 

A reconciliation of segment EBITA to income from continuing operations is shown earlier within this footnote. The following is the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 reconciliation of segment EBITA and segment EBITA margin as reported to adjusted segment EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA margin (unaudited):

(2) Adjusted Corporate expenses excludes special items because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of the Company's business. Adjusted Corporate expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2019 excludes $37 million of integration costs. 

(3) The three months ended December 31, 2020 exclude the net mark-to-market adjustments on restricted investments of $21 million. The three months ended December 31, 2019 exclude the net mark-to-market adjustments on restricted investments of $10 million. 

(4) Restructuring and impairment costs for the three months ended December 31, 2019 of $111 million are excluded from the adjusted non-GAAP results. The restructuring actions and impairment costs related primarily to workforce reductions, plant closures, and asset impairments. 

(5) Management defines earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) as income (loss) from continuing operations before net financing charges, income taxes and noncontrolling interests. EBIT is a non-GAAP performance measure. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company. A reconciliation of EBIT to income (loss) from continuing operations is shown earlier within this footnote.

(6) Adjusted income tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2020 excludes tax provision from net mark-to-market adjustments of $5 million. Adjusted income tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2019 excludes tax provisions related to Switzerland tax reform of $30 million and net mark-to-market adjustments of $3 million, partially offset by tax benefits for restructuring and impairment costs of $16 million and integration costs of $5 million.

2. Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation

The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The adjusting items include transaction/integration costs, net mark-to-market adjustments, restructuring and impairment costs, Power Solutions divestiture reserve adjustment, and discrete tax items. The Company excludes these items because they are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of the Company. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company. 

A reconciliation of diluted earnings per share as reported to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the respective periods is shown below (unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company has presented forward-looking statements regarding adjusted EPS, organic revenue, adjusted EBITA margin, and free cash flow conversion, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses, or income from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period, including but not limited to the high variability of the net mark-to-market adjustments and the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Our fiscal 2021 full year and second quarter guidance for organic revenue also excludes the effect of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of the aforementioned forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s second quarter and full year 2021 GAAP financial results.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4. Free Cash Flow Reconciliation

The Company's press release contains financial information regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP performance measure. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in understanding the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash.

The following is the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 reconciliation of free cash flow for continuing operations (unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

5. Net Debt to EBITDA

The Company provides financial information regarding net debt to adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The Company believes the total net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is useful to understanding the Company's financial condition as it provides a review of the extent to which the Company relies on external debt financing for its funding and is a measure of risk to its shareholders. The following is the December 31, 2020 calculation of net debt to adjusted EBITDA (unaudited):

The following is the last twelve months ended December 31, 2020 reconciliation of income from continuing operations to adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP performance measures (unaudited):

(1) The Company's definition of adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA excludes special items because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of its businesses. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company.

6. Trade Working Capital as a Percentage of Net Sales

The Company provides financial information regarding trade working capital as a percentage of net sales, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. Trade working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities, excluding cash, short-term debt, the current portion of long-term debt, the current portion of assets and liabilities held for sale, accrued compensation and benefits, and other current assets and liabilities. Management believes this non-GAAP measure, which excludes financing-related items, non-trade related items and businesses to be divested, is a more useful measurement of the Company's operating performance. The following is the December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 calculation of trade working capital as a percentage of net sales (unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

7. Income Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations before consideration of transaction/integration costs, net mark-to-market adjustments, restructuring and impairment costs and discrete tax items for the three months ending December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is approximately 13.5%.

8. Restructuring and Impairment Costs

The three months ended December 31, 2019 include restructuring and impairment costs of $111 million related primarily to workforce reductions, plant closures and asset impairments.
