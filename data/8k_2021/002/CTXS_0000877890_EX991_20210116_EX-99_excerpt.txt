A recent survey of 12,000+ employees across the United States, Germany and India conducted by BCG found that employers moved approximately 40% of employees to remote work as a result of the pandemic.4 The study found that nearly 75% of employees indicated that they have been able to maintain or improve productivity on their individual tasks. Just over half indicated that they’ve been able to maintain or improve productivity on collaborative tasks. Moving into our next phase of business transformation, we continue to evaluate the metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) we are measuring our business by internally and those that we provide as external disclosures. As we move into the new year, we want to bring to your attention a few changes we intend to make going forward: Bookings mix assumptions and disclosures. Given that a large majority of our business has already transitioned to the subscription model, rather than providing the mix of total subscription bookings as a percentage of total product bookings underlying our guidance assumptions, we will provide our SaaS as a percentage of subscription bookings mix assumptions Strategic Service Provider (SSP) revenue contribution. Now that two of our three SSP customers have transitioned to a subscription model of consuming Application Delivery & Security (formerly Networking) capacity, and the contribution to our reported revenue has become less impactful to our results (2% of total revenue in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year 2020), we will retire the Revenue by Customer Type table in our first quarter 2021 earnings letter We are hopeful and enthusiastic as we look ahead. We are thrilled to welcome the Wrike team to the Citrix family and are confident that together we will enable our customers to redefine the ways in which their organizations work, and this can drive considerable value for all of our stakeholders—employees, partners, customer and shareholders. The transition of our installed base is gaining traction, and the opportunity for Citrix in the years ahead is substantial as secular shifts toward distributed hybrid and flexible work, security and employee productivity should serve as key demand drivers well into the future.

Guidance Full Year 2021 Our full year 2021 guidance is now: Full Year 2021 Guidance2 Revenue $3.33 billion to $3.36 billion GAA P Operating Margin Approximately 19% Non-GAA P Operating Margin Approximately 30% GAAP Diluted EPS $4.01 to $4.22 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS $6.20 to $6.40 For the full year, our 2021 revenue guidance reflects a full year of impact from discontinuing the general availability of perpetual Workspace licenses and reflects only Citrix’s organic, stand-alone business. This compares to the availability of perpetual Workspace licenses through the first three quarters of 2020. This, combined with the timing and impact of the pandemic, heavily influences our expected annual and quarterly year-over-year growth rates. Our full year guidance assumes that SaaS bookings as a percentage of total subscription bookings will be 50% to 60%. We plan to plan to update our full year 2021 guidance when we announce our quarterly results following the close of the Wrike transaction, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2021. We expect our cash flow from operations to be higher in 2021 compared to 2020. First Quarter 2021 We currently anticipate: First Quarter 2021 Guidance2 Revenue $785 million to $795 million GAAP Diluted EPS $0.87 to $0.93 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS $1.40 to $1.45 In the first quarter of 2020, $111 million of revenue was directly attributable to business continuity needs as a result of the pandemic, creating a difficult year-over-year compare in the first quarter of 2021. Of the $111 million revenue uplift experienced in the first quarter of 2020, $47 million was from limited use non-renewable on-premises term licenses. Our goal is to convert these customers to more standard subscriptions. The degree to which we are successful in converting these customers to cloud subscriptions, The degree to which we are successful in converting these customers to cloud subscriptions, which is our strategic direction, will impact our reported revenue in the quarter, as more of the bookings value would go to deferred and unbilled revenue. Our first quarter guidance assumes that SaaS bookings as a percentage of total subscription bookings will be 40% to 45%. The above statements are based on current targets as of the date of this letter, and we undertake no obligation to update after such date. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. 2 A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this letter.

Citrix assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information contained in this letter or with respect to the announcements described herein. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures (Unaudited) Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this letter and related conference callor webcast to the most directly comparable   

GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses and charges associated with the Company’s restructuring programs, and the related tax effect of those items. The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The Company’s basis for these adjustments is described below. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company’s performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company’s executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items or cash charges that are the result of discrete activities that are not used by management when evaluating the Company’s historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company’s operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company’s financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors. Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company’s operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company’s operating performance due to the following factors: The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company’s operating results and underlying operational trends. Amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company’s employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant. The Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs. Each restructuring activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. While the Company’s operations previously benefited from the employees and facilities covered by the various restructuring charges, these employees and facilities have benefited different parts of the Company’s business in different ways, and the amount of these charges has varied significantly from period to period. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company’s operating results and underlying operational trends. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non­ GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for 2020 I04 and Full Year Financials 19   

or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company’s liquidity.
