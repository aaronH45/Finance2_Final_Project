SECAUCUS, N.J., Feb.4, 2021 - Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2020.

"In a year dominated by the pandemic, Quest brought critical COVID-19 testing to our country, and delivered record revenues, earnings and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2020," said Steve Rusckowski, Chairman, CEO and President. “Declines in our base business recovered rapidly throughout the summer and fall; however the recovery stalled at the end of November and into December due to the surge in COVID-19 infections across the country. Continued high demand for COVID-19 testing drove our performance through the second half of the year. 

“In light of the company’s strong financial position, we have increased our dividend and our share repurchase authorization while maintaining flexibility to pursue our M&A strategy,” Mr. Rusckowski continued. “Given the ongoing uncertainty regarding the trajectory of the virus and its impact on COVID-19 testing trends as well as further recovery of our base business, we are providing an outlook for the first six months of 2021. We expect to provide additional updates as the year progresses.” 

Mr. Rusckowski continued: “The pandemic has tested our nearly 50,000 employees and they have responded as heroes, by developing COVID-19 tests, building test capacity, innovating new testing models with our retail partners, transporting specimens, delivering results and of course, supporting our customers. I’m proud of what we have achieved and optimistic about what we can accomplish in 2021.”

(b)The sum of reported and adjusted diluted EPS for the four quarters of 2020 did not equal the total for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to quarterly fluctuations in the company's earnings and weighted average common shares outstanding throughout the year as a result of the impact of COVID-19 and the temporary suspension of repurchases under the company's share repurchase program.

Outlook for First Half of 2021

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures

As used in this press release the term “reported” refers to measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The term “adjusted” refers to non-GAAP operating performance measures that exclude special items such as restructuring and integration charges, certain financial impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, amortization expense, excess tax benefits ("ETB") associated with stock-based compensation, a gain on remeasurement of an equity interest, costs associated with donations, contributions and other financial support through Quest for Health Equity, the company’s recently announced initiative with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation to reduce health disparities in underserved communities, the gain on the sale and leaseback of a property, and other items.

Non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. Non-GAAP adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. Management may use these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, as well as to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess our performance. The additional tables attached below include reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted measures to GAAP measures.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)For both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, represents costs primarily associated with systems conversions and integration incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of restructuring and integration charges on the company's consolidated statements of operations: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(b)For both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, principally includes expense associated with payments to eligible employees to help offset expenses they incurred as a result of COVID-19 and incremental costs incurred primarily to protect the health and safety of the company's employees and customers. The twelve months ended December 31, 2020 also includes certain asset impairment charges.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of these items on the company's consolidated statements of operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(c)For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, primarily represents a gain recognized by an equity method investee to adjust certain of its investments to fair value, a loss on retirement of debt, and, to a lesser extent, costs associated with Quest for Health Equity. For the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily represents a gain associated with the sale and leaseback of a property. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the pre-tax impact primarily represents a gain associated with the sale and leaseback of a property, a gain associated with the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accruals associated with previous acquisitions, and a gain

associated with an insurance claim for hurricane related losses, partially offset by costs incurred related to a data security incident and non-cash asset impairment charges.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of these other items on the company's consolidated statement of operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d)For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the pre-tax impact represents a gain of $70 million recognized in other income, net based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of an equity interest. On August 1, 2020, the company completed its acquisition of the remaining 56% interest in Mid America Clinical Laboratories, LLC ("MACL") from its joint venture partners. As a result of the transaction, the company remeasured its previously held minority interest in MACL to fair value and recognized a gain. 

(e)For restructuring and integration charges, COVID-19 impacts, other items and amortization expense, income tax impacts, where recorded, were primarily calculated using combined statutory income tax rates of 25.5% for both 2020 and 2019. For the gain on remeasurement of equity interest, income tax expense was calculated based on an effective income tax rate on the transaction of 11.8%, which is lower than the statutory income tax rate due to a permanent difference in the financial reporting and tax basis of goodwill. For the gain associated with an insurance claim for hurricane related losses in 2019, there was no net income tax expense as the company was able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had previously been established. For the gain in 2019 associated with the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accruals associated with previous acquisitions, there was no net income tax expense related to acquisitions in which the gain is non-taxable.

3)Discontinued operations, net of taxes, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 includes discrete tax benefits of $20 million associated with the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies related to Nichols Institute Diagnostics, a test kit manufacturing subsidiary whose operations were discontinued in 2006.

4)In November 2020, the company lifted the temporary suspension, announced on April 22, 2020, of the company’s common stock repurchase program. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the company repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock for $250 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of its common stock for $325 million. As of December 31, 2020, $0.9 billion remained available under the company’s share repurchase authorizations. 

5)During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the company received $138 million of funds that were appropriated to healthcare providers under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the company returned the funds and net cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of the repayment. 

6)The outlook for adjusted diluted EPS represents management’s estimates for the first half of 2021 before the impact of special items. Further impacts to earnings related to special items may occur throughout 2021. Additionally, the amount of ETB is dependent upon employee stock option exercises and the company's stock price, which are difficult to predict. The outlook for diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS is subject to the risks and uncertainties described under "Forward Looking Statements". The following table reconciles our first half of 2021 outlook for adjusted diluted EPS to the corresponding amounts determined under GAAP:
