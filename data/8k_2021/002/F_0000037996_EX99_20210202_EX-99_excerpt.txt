 2 Customers in the U.S. in the fourth quarter began taking delivery of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E; the Bronco Sport, ahead of the summer return of the legendary Bronco; and the 2021 F-150 pickup – all expected to be significant contributors to 2021 results. In fourth-quarter 2020, the company generated $1.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow and ended the year with sequentially higher cash (nearly $31 billion) and total liquidity (almost $47 billion). Ford produced quarterly company adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $1.7 billion, up from $485 million, and an adjusted EBIT margin of 20. (Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year.) The automotive EBIT margin was 3.8%. Gains were broad-based and largely resulted from improved pricing and lower structural costs, as well as the overlap with UAW contract-ratification costs in 2019. According to John Lawler, Ford’s chief financial officer, the third and fourth quarters of 2020 provided evidence of progress against the plan to turn around the company’s automotive business and improve profitability. Financial objectives of the plan include: • Maintaining a strong balance sheet and sharp discipline in allocating capital • Deriving greater benefits from the ongoing redesign of Ford’s global business and its products and services portfolio • Targeting an 8% adjusted EBIT margin – 10% in North America and 6% in Europe, with all regions profitable – and healthy adjusted free cash flow, increasing the company’s financial flexibility, and • Investing in strategic areas like EVs, connected services and autonomous vehicles – the returns on which are expected to further fortify the balance sheet and fuel growth. “We are profoundly changing the trajectory of our earnings power,” said Lawler, “unlocking the tremendous value Ford can create for customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.” The company improved quarterly operating results in every one of its regional auto businesses along with Ford Credit. Cumulative EBIT outside of North America was $666 million better than a year earlier. North America EBIT was up 53% to $1.1 billion. The increase was attributable to yield management and the absence of UAW contract ratification costs in the quarter – offset, as expected, by lower vehicle volumes because of manufacturing changeovers at two plants to introduce the all-new, 2021 F-150. Under the UAW-Ford collective bargaining agreement, the company’s North America pre-tax profits will generate about $3,625 in profit-sharing payouts per eligible UAW-represented employee on a full-year basis. The payments will be made in March. Fourth-quarter new product launches were carried out efficiently and with high quality. In mid- January, the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 were named 2021 North American Utility and Truck of the Year, respectively. With Ford’s North America portfolio transformation nearly complete, 97% of its product mix in the region now comprises trucks, vans and utility vehicles. In Europe, Ford posted $414 million in EBIT – its highest quarterly profit in the region in more than four years – and an EBIT margin of 5.8%. Through the first phase of restructuring, the company has reduced its annual structural costs by $1.1 billion. All three business focus areas – commercial, passenger and import – were profitable in the fourth quarter. Ford bolstered the No. 1 position of its Transit commercial vans, with net pricing and share both up. Retail sales in China were up 30% – faster than the overall industry – as the company achieved its fourth straight quarter of share growth. The higher share was propelled, in part, by rising customer preference for locally produced versions of the Lincoln Corsair and Aviator. SUVs  

 3 accounted for 36% of Ford’s mix in China; commercial vehicles – light trucks, vans, buses and pickups – represented 45%. The business cut its EBIT loss 68% to $66 million, the third consecutive quarter of yearly improvement. Ford reduced its EBIT loss in South America for the fifth straight quarter, then in mid-January took more forceful actions to counter persistently weak industry demand and other regional economic realities. Ford Brazil decided to cease manufacturing at its three in-country plants. The company will now serve customers in Brazil and across South America with connected services and vehicles – including electrified models – sourced from other markets. Combined shipments by the International Markets Group were up nearly 2%, compared with an industry decline of 3%. Absent India, IMG was profitable in the fourth quarter, with Australia and Vietnam among strong national markets. An EBIT loss of $62 million including India was down sharply from a loss of $174 million last year. In December, Ford and Mahindra jointly decided not to pursue their previously announced joint venture in India. Ford said it is evaluating alternatives and capital allocation priorities in the country. Ford now plans to invest about $7 billion on autonomous vehicles over 10 years through 2025 – $5 billion of that from 2021 forward – as part of its Ford Mobility initiatives. During the quarter, the robust algorithms of Argo AI’s comprehensive self-driving system enabled address-to- address autonomous deliveries of fresh produce and school supplies through a charitable goods pilot in Miami. Separately, Ford’s Spin subsidiary improved its per-trip economics in 2020, while winning an overwhelming majority of the scooter permits it applied for from U.S. municipalities. Ford Credit continued its run of strong performance – keeping customers in their vehicles despite pandemic-related financial hardships, wherever possible, while producing exceptional results. Fourth-quarter earnings before taxes were $912 million, up 48%. Ford Credit’s balance sheet and liquidity remain solid. Regional Highlights  

 4 Doubling Down on Connected EVs Farley said Ford will now invest at least $22 billion in electrification through 2025, nearly twice what the company had previously committed to EVs. He said the company is “all in and will not cede ground to anyone” in developing and delivering connected electric vehicles and services in mainstream areas of strength for Ford: pickups, commercial vans and SUVs. “We are accelerating all our plans – breaking constraints, increasing battery capacity, improving costs and getting more electric vehicles into our product cycle plan,” Farley said. “People are responding to what Ford is doing today, not someday.” The Mustang Mach-E, he said, is receiving great customer and critical reviews, and will be followed by the first E-Transit commercial van (late 2021) and an all-electric F-150 pickup (mid- 2022). He added that EVs will be fundamental to the Lincoln luxury brand and the Transit commercial lineup, the latter across a variety of body styles and customized interiors. Ford’s development and delivery of connected vehicles will be enhanced by a new, six-year partnership with Google announced earlier this week. The two companies are establishing a collaborative group – Team Upshift – to unlock personalized consumer experiences, and create and make the most of data-driven opportunities. The relationship will help Ford accelerate its transformation in key areas – modernizing operations, disrupting how it does things, partnering for expertise and efficiency, and creating must-have products and services – through Google’s operating system, apps and services. As EVs become primary in Ford’s lineup, he said, dedicated manufacturing capacity for them will expand around the world. To date, the company is producing electric vehicles or plans to in Michigan (F-150); Missouri (E-Transit); two plants in Canada (SUVs); and Mexico and China (Mach-E), with others to follow. Outlook Ford’s Lawler said the company was on course to earn $8 billion to $9 billion in adjusted EBIT – including a $900 million noncash gain on its investment in Rivian – and generate $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow in 2021. That scenario anticipated continued EBIT improvement in each of Ford’s regional businesses, except South America. However, the global semiconductor shortage is creating uncertainty across multiple industries and will influence Ford’s 2021 operating results. “The semiconductor situation is changing constantly, so it’s premature to try to size what availability will mean for our full-year performance,” he said. “Right now, estimates from suppliers could suggest losing 10% to 20% of our planned first-quarter production.” According to Lawler, production losses in that range projected across the entire first half of the year – along with assumptions for some cost offsets and volume make-ups in the second half – could imply that the shortages will lower Ford’s 2021 adjusted EBIT by $1.0 billion to $2.5 billion. He said the company expects full-year cash and EBIT effects to be about equal – with quarterly cash implications more volatile, given the mechanics of company working capital.  

 5 “Our team is working with suppliers around the clock to optimize the constrained supply and minimize profit impact, while prioritizing customer orders, new-vehicle launches and compliance with CO2 emissions regulations,” said Lawler. Ford plans to provide an update on the semiconductor issue when it reports first-quarter 2021 financial results on April 28. # # # About Ford Motor Company Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) is a global company based in Dearborn, Michigan.

 14 Non-GAAP Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures We use both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends, and a means to assess our period-over- period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. • Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income / (Loss) attributable to Ford) – Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. Pre-tax special items consist of (i) pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses, (ii) significant personnel expenses, dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, and (iii) other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. • Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income / (Loss) Margin) – Company Adjusted EBIT Margin is Company Adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. • Adjusted Earnings / (Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings / (Loss) Per Share) – Measure of Company’s diluted net earnings / (loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of the underlying run rate of our business. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings / (loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings / (loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. • Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) – Measure of Company’s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses • Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (FCF) (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By / (Used In) Operating Activities) – Measure of Company’s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit’s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Automotive and Mobility capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, global redesign (including separations), and other items that are considered operating cash flows under GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management’s assessment of the Company’s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company Adjusted FCF, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by / (used in) our operating activities. • Adjusted ROIC – Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit after-cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. This calculation provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company’s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit after-cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension / OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension / OPEB liability. Note: Calculated results may not sum due to rounding
