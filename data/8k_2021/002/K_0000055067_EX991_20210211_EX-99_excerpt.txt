Kellogg Company Reports Strong 2020 Results and Issues 2021 Financial Guidance

BATTLE CREEK, Mich. - February 11, 2021 - Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) today announced fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and provided a financial outlook for 2021.

Highlights:

•Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kellogg has executed well against its priorities of ensuring employees' health and safety, supplying food to the marketplace, and aiding its communities.

•The Company finished the year with results that were on or better than its guidance for each of its key metrics: organic net sales, currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, currency-neutral adjusted earnings per share, and cash flow.

•The Company delivered fourth quarter and full year net sales growth on a reported and organic basis, underpinned by strong in-market performance.

•Fourth quarter and full year 2020 operating profit and earnings per share increased year on year, even as fourth quarter earnings per share were negatively impacted by expenses related to the redemption of debt in December. 

•The company generated better-than-expected cash from operating activities in 2020, enabling it to reduce its debt for greater financial flexibility.

•Despite continued uncertainty during the pandemic, the Company issued 2021 financial guidance that implies growth on a two-year basis that is consistent with its goal of balanced financial delivery.

•The Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend rate in the second quarter, and its intention to resume share repurchases this year.

 "The year 2020 was a year unlike any other, one in which the world faced unprecedented challenges," said Steve Cahillane, Kellogg Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "With the priorities of keeping our employees safe, supplying food to the marketplace, and aiding our communities, we have managed well through the pandemic, while also delivering exceptional results. None of this would have been possible without the dedication, resilience, and agility of our Kellogg colleagues around the world."

Mr. Cahillane added, "We enter 2021 with solid momentum, and I remain confident that Kellogg will emerge from this pandemic a stronger Company. We've enhanced capabilities, reached incremental households, invested in our supply chain, and improved our financial flexibility. We are on sound footing for continued balanced financial delivery."

Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2020 Consolidated Results

 Kellogg's fourth quarter 2020 GAAP (or "reported") net sales increased by approximately 8% year on year aided by an additional week in the fiscal year. On an organic basis, net sales increased by 2.5% year on year, as all four Regions posted growth.

 Full year reported net sales increased by approximately 1% year on year, as the absence of results from businesses divested in 2019 and adverse currency translation were more than offset by business momentum, elevated demand for food at home brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, and a 53rd week in the fiscal year. On an organic basis, net sales increased by approximately 6%.

 Fourth quarter 2020 reported operating profit increased by approximately 7% versus the prior-year quarter, due to the impact of higher net sales, an additional week in the fiscal quarter, and a decrease in one-time charges which more than offset incremental COVID-related costs and a double-digit increase in advertising and consumer promotion. Adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted operating profit increased by almost 2% and 1%, respectively.

 Full year reported operating profit increased approximately 26% year on year largely due to a significant reduction in one-time charges. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased by nearly 3%, as the impact of higher net sales and a 53rd week in the fiscal year more than offset the absence of results from the divested businesses, incremental COVID-related costs, and adverse currency translation. Excluding currency translation, adjusted operating profit increased by approximately 4%.

 2

 Fourth quarter 2020 reported earnings per share improved 40% year over year primarily due to a significant reduction in one-time charges. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share declined approximately 6%, principally due to incremental expenses related to the redemption of debt, which more than offset higher adjusted-basis operating profit. On a currency-neutral adjusted basis, earnings per share declined approximately 7% as currency translation was modestly favorable in the fourth quarter.

 Full year reported earnings per share increased 30% from the prior year due primarily to reduced one-time charges and a lower reported effective tax rate, more than offsetting the absence of results from divested businesses. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased approximately 1%, as higher adjusted operating profit and other income more than offset the absence of divested businesses and a higher adjusted tax rate. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 2%.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Business Performance

Please refer to the segment tables in the back of this document. 

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has prioritized keeping employees safe, supplying food to the marketplace, aiding its communities, and preserving financial flexibility. Throughout the year, the Company made significant investments in overtime pay, safety and sanitation supplies and protocols in its manufacturing facilities, distribution centers and across the sales organization. In order to meet the elevated demand for its products amidst stay-at-home guidelines and travel restrictions around the world, the Company increased production, focused on fewer items, and invested in its employees, warehousing labor, and transportation capacity. And in support of its communities, the Company and its charitable funds donated significant amounts of cash and food since the beginning of the crisis.

Kellogg Company's primary financial objective in 2020 was to deliver sustainable, balanced net sales, profitability and cash flow growth through the continued execution of the Company's Deploy for Growth strategy. It delivered on this objective, meeting or exceeding its twice-raised guidance for key financial metrics, including organic-basis net sales growth, currency-neutral adjusted-basis operating profit growth, currency-neutral adjusted-basis earnings per share growth, and better-than-expected cash flow.

Kellogg North America's reported net sales in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 8%, aided by the inclusion of an additional week in the fiscal quarter. On an organic basis, net sales improved by less than 1%, as the impact of continued consumption growth across its categories in retail channels was offset by shipment timing in certain categories and by continued declines in away-from-home channels. Kellogg North America's reported operating profit increased by 6%, primarily reflecting an additional week in the fiscal quarter, and partially offset by incremental COVID-related costs and increased advertising and consumer promotion investment. On an adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit increased approximately 6%.

 For the full year, Kellogg North America's reported net sales declined by less than half a percent, primarily due to the absence of results from divested businesses, partially offset by the inclusion of a 53rd week in the fiscal year. On an organic basis, net sales increased by 5%, featuring growth in cereal, snacks, and frozen foods, as elevated at-home demand during the pandemic more than offset declines in away-from-home channels. Kellogg North America's reported operating profit increased 21% primarily due to lower one-time charges, and the impact of higher net sales, which more than offset incremental COVID-related costs and the absence of results from divested businesses. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased 3%.

 Kellogg Europe's reported net sales in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 15%, driven by business momentum and an additional week in the fiscal quarter. On an organic basis, net sales increased by more than 7%, again led by cereal, whose demand has remained elevated during the pandemic, and by snacks, which returned to growth after pandemic-related softness in the previous two quarters. Kellogg Europe's reported operating profit increased by approximately 32%, due to lower one-time charges, the impact of higher net sales, and an extra week in the fiscal quarter, partially offset by incremental COVID-

related costs and increased advertising and consumer promotion. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased by approximately 16%, and 11% on a currency-neutral adjusted basis.

 For the full year, Kellogg Europe's reported net sales increased by approximately 7%, driven by business momentum and a 53rd week in the fiscal year. On an organic basis, net sales increased by over 5%, on elevated demand for cereal during the pandemic, as well as strong share gains across key markets. Full year reported operating profit increased approximately 35%, due to lower one-time charges and the impact of higher net sales. On a adjusted basis, operating profit increased by 11%, and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit increased by approximately 10%.

 Kellogg Latin America's reported net sales in the fourth quarter decreased by approximately 2% due to adverse foreign currency translation and the absence of divested businesses. On an organic basis, net sales grew by nearly 10% driven by elevated demand for cereal across the region, and strong Pringles growth in Brazil. Kellogg Latin America's reported operating profit declined by approximately 46% in the fourth quarter, reflecting costs related to new labeling regulations in Mexico, higher advertising and consumer promotion investment, and adverse currency translation. On an adjusted basis, operating profit declined approximately 58%, with currency-neutral adjusted operating profit declining approximately 55%.

 For the full year, Kellogg Latin America's reported net sales declined by less than 3% due to adverse currency translation. On an organic basis, net sales increased by approximately 12%, with broad-based growth across the Region, including growth in snacks, cereal, and frozen foods. Kellogg Latin America's full year reported operating profit increased 14% as the impact of higher net sales and reduced one-time charges more than offset adverse currency translation. On an adjusted basis, operating profit declined by approximately 2%, while on a currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit increased approximately 11%.

 Kellogg Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa's ("AMEA") reported net sales in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 4%, as adverse currency translation was more than offset by the impact of an additional week in the fiscal quarter, and organic-basis growth of over 2%. Growth was driven by strong cereal demand and growth in Pringles, as well as expansion and growth of noodles in Africa and the Middle East. It was partially offset by pandemic-related school closings in North Africa, resulting in the cancellation of school feeding programs, and by civil unrest in Nigeria that disrupted all commerce for almost two weeks early in the quarter. Kellogg AMEA's reported operating profit increased by approximately 20% in the fourth quarter, aided by lower one-time charges, positive currency translation, and an additional week in the fiscal quarter. On an adjusted basis, operating profit grew 11%, and on a currency-neutral, adjusted basis, it grew by approximately 9%.

 For the full year, Kellogg AMEA's reported net sales increased by approximately 5% with adverse currency translation more than offsetting the impact of a 53rd week in the fiscal year. On an organic basis, net sales increased by approximately 8%, with strong growth in cereal, noodles, and Pringles, and with growth across Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Middle East. Kellogg AMEA's reported operating profit increased approximately 4%, due to the impact of higher net sales, and with adverse currency translation offsetting the contribution of a 53rd week in the fiscal year. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased by approximately 4%, and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit increased by approximately 6%.

2021 Full-Year Financial Guidance

The Company issued its initial financial guidance for 2021. Specifically, the Company is projecting:

•Organic net sales to decrease by approximately (1)%, as it compares against unusually strong, COVID-related growth in the prior year; this implies a 2-year compound annual growth of about 2.5%.

•Adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis is expected to decline by approximately (2)%, as it compares against unusually strong, COVID-related growth and a 53rd week in the prior year; this implies a 2-year compound annual growth of 3-4%, after excluding the profit of since-divested businesses from the 2019 base. 

•Adjusted earnings per share, on a currency-neutral basis, is expected to increase by approximately 1%; this implies a 2-year compound annual growth of 4-5% after excluding the profit of since-divested businesses from the 2019 base. 

•Net cash provided by operating activities is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, with capital expenditure of about $0.5 billion. As a result, cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion.

Excluded from this guidance, are any significant supply chain or other prolonged market disruptions related to the pandemic or global economy.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

 This filing includes non-GAAP financial measures that we provide to management and investors that exclude certain items that we do not consider part of on-going operations. Items excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are discussed in the "Significant items impacting comparability" section of this filing. Our management team consistently utilizes a combination of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate business results, to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions, including incentive compensation. As a result, we believe the presentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors’ understanding of our underlying operating performance and in their analysis of ongoing operating trends. All historic non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 

 Non-GAAP financial measures used include currency-neutral and organic net sales, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS, currency-neutral adjusted gross profit, currency-neutral adjusted gross margin, adjusted effective income tax rate, net debt and cash flow. We determine currency-neutral results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.

•Currency-neutral net sales and organic net sales: We adjust the GAAP financial measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral net sales. In addition, we exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency, and differences in shipping days including the 53rd week, resulting in organic net sales. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying net sales performance. By providing these non-GAAP net sales measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of net sales performance for the Company and each of our reportable segments for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives behind net sales growth, pricing realization, and the impact of mix on our business results. These non-GAAP measures are also used to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions. 

•Adjusted: operating profit and diluted EPS: We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, gain/loss on divestiture, and other costs impacting comparability resulting in adjusted. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. 

•Currency-neutral adjusted: gross profit, gross margin, operating profit, and diluted EPS: We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, gain/loss on divestiture, other costs impacting comparability, and foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral adjusted. We excluded the items

which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. 

•Adjusted effective income tax rate: We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, the gain/loss on divestiture, and other costs impacting comparability. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our pre-tax income and the related tax effect of those items on our adjusted effective income tax rate, and other impacts to tax expense, including U.S. Tax Reform and certain out-of-period adjustments, on our adjusted effective income tax rate. By providing this non-GAAP measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's effective tax rate, excluding the pre-tax income and tax effect of the items noted above, for the periods presented. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to monitor the effectiveness of initiatives in place to optimize our global tax rate. 

•Net debt: Defined as the sum of long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable, less cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. With respect to net debt, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are subtracted from the GAAP measure, total debt liabilities, because they could be used to reduce the Company’s debt obligations. Company management and investors use this non-GAAP measure to evaluate changes to the Company's capital structure and credit quality assessment.

•Cash flow: Defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. Cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases once all of the Company’s business needs and obligations are met. Additionally, certain performance-based compensation includes a component of this non-GAAP measure.

 These measures have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.

 Forward-looking guidance for organic net sales, currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, currency-neutral diluted EPS, and cash flow is included in this press release. Guidance for organic net sales excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions, divestitures, and differences in shipping days, including 53rd week. Guidance for operating profit excludes the impact of costs related to restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), multi-employer pension plan exit liabilities, and other items that could affect comparability, and foreign currency translation. Guidance for earnings per share excludes the impact of costs related to restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), multi-employer pension plan exit liabilities, gains or losses on divestitures, and other items that could affect comparability, and foreign currency translation. We have provided these non-GAAP measures for future guidance for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-GAAP measures.

 7

 We are unable to reasonably estimate the potential full-year financial impact of mark-to-market adjustments because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions (interest rates, return on assets, and commodity prices). Similarly, because of volatility in foreign exchange rates and shifts in country mix of our international earnings, we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential full-year financial impact of foreign currency translation. 

 As a result, these impacts are not included in the guidance provided. Therefore, we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures used in our guidance without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a GAAP basis is unavailable, dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the Company.

 See the table below that outlines the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded from non-GAAP guidance for 2021:

Mark-to-market accounting for pension plans, commodities and certain foreign currency contracts

We recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. Actuarial gains/losses for pension plans were recognized in the year they occur. Changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that were recognized in the quarter they occur. We recorded a pre-tax mark-to-market charge of $91 million and $162 million for the quarter and year ended January 2, 2021, respectively. We recorded a pre-tax mark-to-market charge of $118 million and $104 million for the quarter and year ended December 28, 2019, respectively. Included within the aforementioned totals was a pre-tax mark-to-market charge for pension plans of $90 million and $154 million for the quarter and year ended January 2, 2021, respectively, and a pre-tax mark-to-market charge of $119 million and $98 million for the quarter and year ended December 28, 2019, respectively.

Project K

In 2019, the Company completed implementation of all Project K initiatives. We recorded pre-tax charges related to this program of $16 million and $54 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended December 28, 2019, respectively.

Brexit impacts

During 2019, with the uncertainty of the United Kingdom's (U.K.) exit from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as Brexit, we incurred certain costs to proactively prepare for the potential adverse impacts, such as delays at ports of entry and departure. As a result, we incurred pre-tax charges of $2 million and $9 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended December 28, 2019, respectively.

Foreign currency translation

We evaluate the operating results of our business on a currency-neutral basis. We determine currency-neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.
