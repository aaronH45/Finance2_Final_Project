 Item 5.03  

Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On February 10, 2021, the Board of Directors of Western Digital Corporation (the “Company”) approved amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated By-laws (the “By-laws”). The By-laws became effective immediately upon their adoption. In addition to minor ministerial and conforming changes, these amendments principally provide for the following:  

   •    

revisions to the advance notice provisions in Sections 2.11 of the By-laws to clarify that the number of nominees a stockholder may nominate for election at a stockholders’ meeting cannot exceed the number of directors to be elected and require each nominee to state his or her current intent to serve as a director for the full term for which the nominee is standing for election;  

   •    

revisions to various provisions of the By-laws, including Sections 2.04, 3.09 and 4.03, to permit electronic notices in accordance with recent amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law;  

   •    

revisions to Sections 2.07 and 3.11 of the By-laws to clarify the expanded flexibility for electronic delivery of proxies and written consents in accordance with recent amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law, and the addition of a new Section 8.08 to clarify and permit the use of electronic signatures for consents, agreements, certificates or other instruments executed on behalf of the Company;  

   •    

updates to Section 3.17 to conform the rights of inspection of a director to the provisions of Section 220(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law;  

   •    

revisions to Article IV to clarify the Company’s required officer positions;  

   •    

revisions to Section 6.01 to permit any two authorized officers (rather than specified combinations of officers) to sign stock certificates on behalf of the Company; and  

   •    

the addition of a new Section 8.07, which provides that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (i) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain intracorporate matters, including derivative actions, claims involving a breach of fiduciary duty by a director, officer, employee or stockholder of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, actions asserting claims under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws and actions asserting claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and (ii) the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  

The foregoing description of the amendments to the By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the By-laws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and are incorporated herein by reference.
