Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On February 2, 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved an adjustment, applicable only for 2020, to the “business performance factor” (the “BPF”) used to calculate awards for employees under the Company’s Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the “AICP”). The amount payable under the AICP is determined, in part, by multiplying an employee’s target award by the extent to which the Company performance for 2020 met certain pre-established thresholds, which collectively represent the BPF. For 2020, the unadjusted BPF was 23%, but the Committee approved the use of a BPF of 50% (the “Adjusted BPF”) to create a supplemental budget for calculating AICP awards for 2020 performance. Employees other than corporate officers will receive their AICP awards in cash. For corporate officers, the awards will be divided into two portions: one portion paid in a cash amount that is attributable to the unadjusted 2020 BPF (23%), and the remaining portion paid in an amount of time-based restricted stock units, with a one year vesting period, equivalent to the balance of the Adjusted BPF (27%), with differentiation based on each corporate officer’s contributions toward the Company’s efforts in response to COVID-19.

2020 AICP awards remain subject to further adjustment based on individual performance, and final awards will be communicated to employees other than corporate officers as part of the annual compensation notification process in March 2021. Final awards for corporate officers will be determined by the Compensation Committee following performance reviews in February or March 2021.

Historically, the Compensation Committee has refrained from exercising its discretion to modify the AICP awards, but the Compensation Committee believes that the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic warrant this adjustment and the corresponding equity awards for corporate officers. In exercising its discretion, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, that the performance criteria used to set the 2020 AICP targets were established before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly disrupted the Company’s business and required correspondingly significant adjustments to the Company’s operations rendering the pre-established 2020 AICP performance criteria inappropriate for fairly measuring the Company’s performance in 2020. As events associated with the pandemic unfolded, management took decisive action to respond to the disruption, first by promoting the safety and welfare of the Company's global workforce by imposing travel restrictions, work-from-home requirements for certain employees, and safety and preventative measures at the Company’s factories and facilities, and then by helping the communities in which the Company’s employees, customers, and business partners live; developing, producing, and donating personal protective equipment in areas of need; implementing an effective manufacturing restart; and making several major product introductions. Management also took measures to assure the Company's ongoing liquidity and financial stability through financing activities, cash preservation initiatives, capital expense reductions, and cost control measures, including deferring payment of a portion of the salaries of certain corporate officers from May through October, when the Company successfully repaid more than $7 billion of its Automotive debt. These actions helped preserve and advance the Company's long-term performance and positioned the Company to achieve better results in the second, third, and fourth quarters than the Company had forecast at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In view of the unforeseeable impact of the pandemic and the extraordinary response of the Company's workforce, the Compensation Committee considered it appropriate to reward 2020 AICP-eligible employees, including corporate officers, with this modification in recognition of their work and achievements under these challenging circumstances. The Compensation Committee also believes that this modification will have a positive impact on maintaining and improving employee engagement and retention, which is vital for delivering the Company’s Plan in 2021. The Compensation Committee determined to award corporate officers with time-based restricted stock units in lieu of an adjustment to their cash bonus under the AICP in order to further align the interests of the Company’s corporate officers with those of the Company’s shareholders.
