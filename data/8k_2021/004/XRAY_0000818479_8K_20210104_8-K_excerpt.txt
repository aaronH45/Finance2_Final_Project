 Item 1.01  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On December 31, 2020, DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Straight Smile, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Straight Smile”), the members of Straight Smile (the “Straight Smile Members”) and Member Representative SSB, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, in its capacity as the Equityholder Representative, pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding membership interest of Straight Smile (the “Transaction”).  

Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid $1,040,000,000 in cash, as consideration to the Straight Smile Members in exchange for the sale of their membership units, payable at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, subject to customary adjustments for indebtedness (net of cash), transaction expenses and changes to working capital.  

The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants of each of the parties and related indemnification obligations.  

The Transaction closed on December 31, 2020.  

The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.  

The Purchase Agreement is attached as Exhibit 2.1 in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not intended to provide any financial or other information about Straight Smile, the Company or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Purchase Agreement are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules provided by each party in connection with the signing of the Purchase Agreement. These confidential disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing certain matters as facts. The Company’s investors and security holders should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Straight Smile, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.
