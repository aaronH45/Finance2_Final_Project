Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 

Members of Humana Inc.’s (the “Company”) senior management team are scheduled to meet with investors and analysts at industry conferences between March 1, 2021 and March 31, 2021. During the meetings, while continuing to acknowledge the heightened uncertainty surrounding the ongoing pandemic, the Company intends to reaffirm its guidance range of $20.82 to $21.32 in diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) or $21.25 to $21.75 in adjusted earnings per common share (“Adjusted EPS”), in each case for the year ending December 31, 2021 (“FY 2021”). This guidance is consistent with the guidance issued in Humana’s press release dated February 3, 2021. The date and time of presentations to investors are available via the Investor Relations calendar of events on the Company’s website at www.humana.com. 

The Company has included Adjusted EPS in this current report, a financial measure that is not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Management believes that this measure, when presented in conjunction with the comparable measure of GAAP EPS, is useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the Company’s ongoing business and operating performance. Consequently, management uses Adjusted EPS as an indicator of the Company’s business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP EPS. A reconciliation of GAAP EPS to Adjusted EPS follows:
