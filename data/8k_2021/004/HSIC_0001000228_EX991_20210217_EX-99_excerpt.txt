MELVILLE, N.Y.,

 February 17, 2021 – 

Henry Schein, Inc. (Nasdaq: HSIC), the world’s largest provider of health care 

solutions to office-based dental and medical practitioners, today reported fourth quarter financial

 results from continuing 

operations. Results from continuing operations exclude contributions

 from Henry Schein’s former Animal Health business, 

which was spun off in February 2019 to form a new publicly traded company, Covetrus (Nasdaq: CVET). 

Total net sales for the quarter ended December 26, 2020,

 were $3.2 billion, an increase of 18.6% compared with the 

fourth quarter of 2019, driven by sales of personal protective equipment (PPE)

 and COVID-19 related products. The 18.6% 

increase included 17.1% internal growth in local currencies, 0.3%

 growth from acquisitions and 1.2% growth related to 

foreign currency exchange.

 (See Exhibit A for details of sales growth). 

GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. from continuing operations

 for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 

$141.9 million, or

 $0.99 per diluted share, compared with prior-year GAAP net income from continuing

 operations of $330.6 

million, or $2.25 per diluted share, which included a net gain on sale of equity

 investments of approximately $186.8 million, 

or $1.27 per diluted share.

 Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter

 of 2020 was $143.6 

million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with prior-year non-GAAP net income

 from continuing operations of $143.0 

million, or $0.97 per diluted share. Exhibit B provides a reconciliation of GAAP

 net income and diluted EPS from continuing 

operations to non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS from continuing operations.

 Operating margin was unfavorably 

impacted by significant inventory adjustments associated with PPE and COVID-19

 related products, and lower supplier 

rebates, partially offset by lower expenses as a percentage of sales. Operating margin was also negatively

 impacted by a non-

cash intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $18.1 million, or $0.07

 per diluted share. Both GAAP and non-

GAAP net income for the fourth quarter 2020 were favorably impacted

 by income tax resolutions in the U.S. and 

internationally, which lowered income tax expense by approximately $14.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share.

 “Against the backdrop of a most challenging year in our history due to

 the COVID-19 pandemic, with an 

unprecedented human toll and economic impact worldwide,

 Henry Schein’s unwavering focus on our customers, along with 

our resilience and agility, enabled us to deliver fourth quarter total net sales growth of 18.6%. In addition, we

 delivered 

record total net sales growth for the second half of 2020 as our end markets

 have rebounded,

 and we recognize the 

commitment and sacrifice of our Team Schein Members globally,” said Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman of the Board and 

Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein.

 “We were successful in supporting practices that were initially open for emergency 

services and also assisting customers preparing to restore practices

 to increased operating capacity as restrictions eased. Over 

time, we expect that patient traffic will improve to pre-COVID-19 levels.”

“I remain confident that Henry Schein is well-positioned for future continued

 success given the breadth of our 

products, services and support across the global dental and medical markets,”

 Mr. Bergman continued.

Dental sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $1.8 billion increased

 7.2% versus the prior-year. In local currencies, 

internally generated sales increased 5.1% with 0.4%

 growth from acquisitions and 1.7% growth related to foreign currency 

exchange. The 5.1%

 internal growth in local currencies included a decline of 0.7%

 in North America and an increase of 

14.2% internationally.

Global dental consumable merchandise internal sales increased by 10.0%

 in local currencies. Excluding PPE and 

COVID-19 related products, sales increased by 5.0%. In North America,

 dental consumable merchandise internal sales in 

local currencies increased 5.3%, or 0.4% excluding PPE and COVID-19

 related products, and dental equipment internal sales 

in local currencies decreased 13.2%. Dental equipment sales performance

 was impacted by a difficult prior-year comparison. 

In addition, we believe some practices potentially held off on year-end equipment purchases as U.S.

 tax incentives may be 

more favorable in 2021. Internationally, dental consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies increased 16.7%, or 

11.4% excluding PPE and COVID-19 related products, and dental equipment internal sales

 in local currencies increased 

6.8%. 

“We reported strong overall global dental sales growth in the fourth quarter. High-acuity procedures, including dental 

specialties and restorative procedures, also contributed to year-over-year sales growth.

 The 5.0% quarterly growth rate for 

global dental consumable sales is among the highest recorded by Henry Schein

 since 2017. International sales results for both 

consumable merchandise and equipment were strong. Dental patient traffic has remained at stable

 levels compared to the 

third quarter of 2020,

 even in countries experiencing more stringent lockdown rules, with

 the exception of the U.K.,” noted 

Mr. Bergman.

Medical sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $1.2 billion increased 48.5%

 compared with the same period last year, 

consisting of 48.2%

 growth in local currencies with 0.3%

 growth related to foreign currency exchange.

 There was no 

acquisition growth in the quarter.

“Our Medical business experienced strong year-over-year sales growth in the fourth quarter driven

 by continued 

demand for PPE and COVID-19 related products, most specifically

 for COVID-19 test sales. For the second quarter in a row, 

our global Medical business has achieved over $1 billion in quarterly

 sales,”

 remarked Mr. Bergman. “Excluding sales of 

PPE and COVID-19 related products, sales increased by approximately

 3.6%. We believe solid COVID-19 test sales growth 

is likely to continue while COVID-19 cases remain at relatively high

 levels.”

Technology and Value

 -Added Services sales of $138.7

 million increased 1.2%

 versus the prior-year. The 1.2% 

increase included a decline of 0.7%

 in internal local currency sales,

 offset by 1.2%

 growth from acquisitions and 0.7% 

growth related to foreign currency exchange. 

“Technology and Value

 -Added Services sales in the quarter were impacted by lower transactional

 revenue associated 

with a lower number of patient visits compared to pre-COVID-19 practice volume.

 We also experienced a difficult prior-year 

comparison that benefited from hardware upgrades

 as we helped transition customers to address new operating system 

requirements.

 In addition, lower dental equipment sales volume in North America

 impacted our hardware revenue,” said Mr. 

Bergman. “We

 were pleased with solid growth in our Dentrix Ascend cloud-based

 software and North America financial 

services sales. We continue to invest in our technology solutions, including Henry Schein One, which is a key resource to 

help drive business success for dental practices.”

2020 Financial Results

Total net sales for 2020 were $10.1 billion, an increase of 1.3%

 compared with 2019. In local currencies, internally 

generated sales increased 0.8%. Changes in foreign currency exchange

 resulted in a 0.1% decline in sales, while acquisitions 

contributed 0.6%

 to growth.

GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. from continuing operations

 for 2020 was $402.8 million, or 

$2.81 per diluted share, compared with GAAP net income from continuing

 operations for 2019 of $700.7 million, 

or $4.69 per diluted share.

 Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for 2020 was $425.3

 million, or $2.97 per 

diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income from continuing

 operations for 2019 of $523.6 million, or $3.51 per 

diluted share. The decline in non-GAAP net income was driven by COVID-19,

 primarily during the second quarter. Exhibit 

B provides a reconciliation of GAAP net income and diluted EPS from

 continuing operations to non-GAAP net income and 

diluted EPS from continuing operations. 

Stock Repurchase Plan 

Prior to the suspension of the Company’s share repurchase program due to COVID-19, for fiscal year 2020

 Henry 

Schein repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock at

 an average price of $61.49 for a total of $73.8 

million. At fiscal year-end, Henry Schein had $201 million authorized

 and available for future stock repurchases. Pursuant to 

amendments to certain credit facilities, Henry Schein is restricted from engaging

 in stock repurchases until the Company 

reports second-quarter 2021 financial results.

Financial Guidance

Henry Schein today introduced guidance for 2021 non-GAAP

 diluted EPS from continuing operations.

 At this time, 

the Company is not providing guidance for 2021 GAAP diluted EPS

 from continuing operations as it is unable to provide an 

accurate estimate of expenses related to an ongoing restructuring initiative

 in 2021. Financial guidance is as follows: 

●

2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable

 to Henry Schein, Inc. is expected to be at or 

above 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations of $3.51.

 The Company believes the comparison to 

2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is most appropriate

 given the impact of COVID-19 on 2020 

results of operations. 

●

Guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc.

 is for current continuing operations as 

well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, and does not

 include the impact of potential future 

acquisitions, if any, restructuring expenses or share repurchases. Guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates that 

are generally consistent with current levels, and that end markets remain stable

 and are consistent with current market 

conditions. Guidance does not assume any material market changes

 associated with COVID-19. 

Adjustments to Projected 2021 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS 

The Company has provided guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS

 from continuing operations,

 as noted above. 

A reconciliation to the Company’s projected 2021 diluted EPS from continuing operations prepared on a GAAP

 basis is not 

provided because the Company is unable to provide without unreasonable

 effort an estimate of costs related to an ongoing 

restructuring program to mitigate stranded costs and drive additional operating

 efficiencies, including the corresponding tax 

effect that will be included in the Company’s 2021 diluted EPS from continuing operations prepared on a GAAP basis. The 

inability to provide these reconciliations is due to the uncertainty and inherent

 difficulty of predicting the occurrence, 

magnitude, financial impact,

 and the timing of related costs. Management does not believe

 these items are representative of 

the Company’s underlying business performance. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable 

significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to

 future results. 

Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call Webcast

The Company will hold a conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2020 financial

 results today, beginning at 10:00 

a.m. Eastern time. Individual investors are invited to listen to the conference

 call through Henry Schein’s website by visiting 

www.henryschein.com/IRwebcasts

. In addition, a replay will be available beginning shortly

 after the call has ended for a 

period of one week.

documents we have filed with the United States Securities and Exchange

 Commission, or SEC, and will be contained in all

Forward looking statements include the overall impact 

of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, and financial 

condition (including any estimates of the impact on these items), the rate and

 consistency with which dental and other 

practices resume or maintain normal operations in the United States and

 internationally, expectations regarding personal 

protective equipment (“PPE”) and COVID-19 related product sales and inventory

 levels and whether additional resurgences 

of the virus will adversely impact the resumption of normal operations,

 the impact of restructuring programs as well as of any 

future acquisitions, and more generally current expectations regarding

 performance in current and future periods.

 Forward 

looking statements also include the (i) ability of the Company to make

 additional testing available, the nature of those tests

vaccines and ancillary supplies.

Risk factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from

 current and historical results 

include, but are not limited to: risks associated with COVID-19,

 as well as other disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or 

similar wide spread public health concerns and other natural disasters or

 acts of terrorism; our dependence on third parties for 

the manufacture and supply of our products; our ability to develop or acquire

 and maintain and protect new products

(particularly technology products) and technologies that achieve market acceptance

 with acceptable margins; transitional 

challenges associated with acquisitions, dispositions and joint

 ventures, including the failure to achieve anticipated 

synergies/benefits; financial and tax risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions and

 joint ventures; certain provisions in 

our governing documents that may discourage third-party acquisitions

 of us; effects of a highly competitive (including, 

without limitation, competition from third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating

 market; the potential repeal or 

judicial prohibition on implementation of the Affordable Care Act; changes

 in the health care industry; risks from expansion 

of customer purchasing power and multi-tiered costing structures; increases

trade agreements and potential trade barriers; failure to comply with

 existing and future regulatory requirements; risks 

associated with the EU Medical Device Regulation; failure to comply

 with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud 

or other laws and regulations; failure to comply with laws and regulations relating

 changes in tax legislation; litigation risks; new or 

unanticipated litigation developments and the status of litigation

 matters; cyberattacks or other privacy or data security 

breaches; risks associated with our global operations; our dependence on

 our senior management, as well as employee hiring 

and retention; and disruptions in financial markets. The order in which these

 factors appear should not be construed to 

indicate their relative importance or priority.

We caution that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond our ability to control 

or predict. Accordingly, any forward-looking statements contained herein should not be relied upon as a prediction of

 principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial 

measures adjust the Company’s actual results prepared under GAAP to exclude certain items.

 In the schedules attached to 

this press release, the non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to and should

 be considered together with the Consolidated 

Statements of Income. Management believes that non-GAAP

 financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental 

information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison

 of financial results between periods where 

certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow

 for greater transparency with respect to key metrics 

used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP

 financial measures are presented solely for informational 

and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding,

 similarly captioned, GAAP 

measures.

Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures

 provide investors with useful supplemental information

 about the financial 

performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results

 between periods where certain items may

 vary independent of 

business performance and allow for greater transparency

 with respect to key metrics used by management

 in operating our business. 

These non-GAAP financial measures are

 presented solely for informational and

 comparative purposes and should not be regarded

 as a 

replacement for corresponding,

 similarly captioned, GAAP measures.

 Earnings per share numbers may not

 sum due to rounding.
