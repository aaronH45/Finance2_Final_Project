CEO Comment

Commenting on the company's results and outlook, Ryder Chairman and CEO Robert Sanchez said, "I am pleased that we delivered significantly higher year over year earnings in the fourth quarter and made progress on our initiatives to improve returns. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in 2020 in line with our goal to deliver positive free cash flow over the cycle. 

"Improving used vehicle market conditions resulted in gains on sale in the second half of 2020 and enabled us to reduce inventory levels to within our target range. Actions taken to align the rental fleet size with lower demand conditions following the pandemic have been successful, resulting in fourth quarter utilization levels higher than prior year. ChoiceLease pricing initiatives continue to benefit returns and are resulting in higher revenue per new lease vehicle. Ongoing progress on our multi-year maintenance cost-savings initiative generated $30 million in savings in 2020.

"Efforts to accelerate growth in SCS and DTS continue and include the launch of our national multimedia advertising campaign, which has generated an increase in sales leads and traffic to Ryder.com. The 2020 launch of RyderShare, our digital platform for real-time freight visibility and collaboration, continues to gain traction as the platform has been used to track almost two million shipments for supply chain and dedicated customers.

“Finally, I'm extremely grateful to Ryder's frontline employees who have continued to deliver in a very difficult environment, and in recognition we awarded them one-time bonuses totaling $28 million."

Outlook

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2

"While the 2021 market environment remains uncertain and may be impacted by developments related to COVID-19 and other factors, we expect improving economic conditions, continued secular trends that favor outsourcing, and progress on our strategic initiatives. Based on this outlook and an improved deal pipeline, we expect higher contractual sales activity. Operating revenue growth in SCS and DTS is expected to be within the high-single-digit target range, with FMS growth near the lower end of the mid-single digit target range. 

"The expected earnings benefit related to a lower depreciation expense impact from prior residual value estimate changes, better rental performance, and our actions to improve returns are expected to be the key contributors to approaching our interim target for adjusted ROE of 11% in 2021. Used vehicle market pricing is anticipated to modestly improve throughout the year. We're planning to grow the rental fleet to capture increased demand from a strong e-commerce and freight environment. The benefits from higher lease pricing and our maintenance cost-savings initiative are expected to be partially offset by a smaller lease fleet. We expect to deliver strong free cash flow this year, consistent with our goal to generate positive free cash flow over the cycle.

"We are accelerating investments in strategic initiatives to capitalize on the growing market demand for innovative supply chain solutions, improve the customer experience, expand sales capabilities, and achieve our growth and return targets over time."

Fourth Quarter Business Segment Operating Results

Fleet Management Solutions: Earnings Increased Primarily Reflecting Improved Used Vehicle Sales Results, Including Declining Impact of Depreciation Expense from Prior Residual Value Estimate Changes, and Better Results in Lease and Rental

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment, total revenue declined due to lower fuel and operating revenue. Operating revenue declined due primarily to a 7% decrease in rental revenue from lower demand on a smaller fleet.

3

FMS EBT increased by $141 million reflecting a declining impact of depreciation expense from prior vehicle residual value estimate changes and higher gains on used vehicles sold together totaling $62 million. We significantly reduced our used vehicle inventory to within our target range at year-end. Lease results benefited from lower insurance costs from the discontinuance of the lease liability product and higher pricing on lease vehicles. Rental power fleet utilization in the quarter was strong at 79%, up from 76% in the prior year on a 16% smaller fleet. Utilization increased due to improving economic conditions and actions taken to align the fleet with market demand. Rental results benefited from lower maintenance costs, including benefits from our cost-savings initiative, and higher pricing. FMS earnings before tax as a percentage of FMS operating revenue is below the company's long-term target of high single digits, reflecting depreciation from prior residual value estimate changes.

Supply Chain Solutions: Results Benefited from Higher Pricing and Growth 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment, total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to new business, increased pricing, and higher volumes. Revenue increases reflect growth in consumer packaged goods, retail, and automotive.

SCS earnings before tax increased due to higher pricing and new business, partially offset by favorable insurance claims development in the prior year and higher compensation-related costs. SCS EBT as a percentage of SCS operating revenue is below the company's long-term target of high single digits for the fourth quarter, but is within the target range for full year 2020. 

4

Dedicated Transportation Solutions: Lower Earnings Primarily Due to Prior Year Favorable Insurance Claims, Partially Offset by Improved Operating Performance

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS) business segment, total revenue and operating revenue declined primarily due to lower contractual sales in late 2019 and early 2020.

DTS earnings before tax decreased primarily due to a favorable insurance claims development in the prior year, partially offset by improved operating performance. DTS EBT as a percentage of DTS operating revenue is below the company's long-term target of high single digits for the fourth quarter, but is within the target range for full year 2020.

Corporate Financial Information

Unallocated Central Support Services

In the fourth quarter of 2020, unallocated CSS costs were $49 million as compared to $15 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting a previously announced one-time expense of $28 million for a recognition and retention bonus paid to frontline workers.

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 was a benefit of 10.6% as compared to a benefit of 56.6% in the prior year. Tax rates in both periods were impacted by lower earnings due to prior residual value estimate changes. The comparable effective income tax rate (a non-GAAP measure) from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 was an expense of 9.0% as compared to a benefit of 98.7% in the prior year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate reflects the impact of favorable discrete items on a low level of earnings before taxes. 

Capital Expenditures, Cash Flow, and Leverage 

Full year gross capital expenditures decreased to $1.1 billion in 2020 compared with $3.6 billion in 2019 due to lower investments in the lease and rental fleets.

5

Full year operating cash flow was $2.2 billion in 2020, up from $2.1 billion in 2019. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) was positive $1.6 billion, up from negative $(1.1) billion in 2019, reflecting decreased capital spending as well as improved working capital.

Debt-to-equity as of December 31, 2020 declined to 293% from 320% at year-end 2019, and is now within the company's long-term target of 250-300%. The decrease in debt-to-equity from year-end 2019 primarily reflects the reduction in debt due to higher free cash flow.

Our forward-looking statements also include our estimates of the impact of our changes to residual value estimates on earnings and depreciation expense. The expected impact of the change in residual value estimates is based on our current assessment of the residual values and useful lives of revenue-earning equipment based on multi-year trends and our outlook for the expected near-term used vehicle market. Our assessment is subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results related to vehicle residual values to materially differ from estimates include, but are not limited to, changes in supply and demand, including due to COVID-19 impacts and other factors, competitor pricing, regulatory requirements, driver shortages, requirements and preferences, as well as changes in underlying assumption factors.

All of our forward-looking statements should be evaluated with consideration given to the many risks and uncertainties inherent in our business that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among others, the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses thereto; our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, lower than expected contractual sales, decreases in commercial rental demand or utilization or poor acceptance of rental pricing, worsening of market demand for or excess supply of used vehicles impacting current and/or estimated pricing and our anticipated proportion of retail versus wholesale sales; lack of customer demand for our services; higher than expected maintenance costs; lower than expected benefits from our cost-savings initiatives; lower than expected benefits from our sales, marketing and new product initiatives; higher than expected costs related to our ERP implementation; setbacks or uncertainty in the economic market or in our ability to grow and retain profitable customer accounts; implementation or enforcement of regulations; decreases in freight demand or volumes; used vehicle inventory levels; poor operational execution including with respect to new accounts and product launches; our difficulty in obtaining adequate profit margins for our services; our inability to maintain current pricing levels due to soft economic conditions; business interruptions or expenditures due to labor disputes; severe weather or natural occurrences; competition from other service providers and new entrants; lower than anticipated customer retention levels; loss of key customers; driver and technician shortages resulting in higher procurement costs and turnover rates; higher than expected bad debt reserves or write-offs; changes in customers' business environments that will limit their ability to commit to long-term vehicle leases; a decrease in credit ratings; increased debt costs; adequacy of accounting estimates; higher than expected reserves and accruals particularly with respect to pension, taxes, depreciation, insurance and revenue; impact of changes in our residual value estimates and accounting policies, including our depreciation policy; the sudden or unusual changes in fuel prices; unanticipated currency exchange rate fluctuations; our ability to manage our cost structure; and the risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The risks included here are not exhaustive. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risks on our business. Accordingly, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Set forth in the table below is an overview of each non-GAAP financial measure and why management believes that presentation of each non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. See reconciliations for each of these measures following this table.

Operating Revenue Measures:

Operating Revenue

FMS Operating Revenue

SCS Operating Revenue

DTS Operating Revenue

FMS EBT as a % of FMS Operating Revenue

SCS EBT as a % of SCS Operating Revenue

DTS EBT as a % of DTS Operating Revenue

Operating revenue is defined as total revenue for Ryder System, Inc. or each business segment (FMS, SCS and DTS) excluding any (1) fuel and (2) subcontracted transportation, as well as (3) revenue from our ChoiceLease liability insurance program which was discontinued in early 2020. We believe operating revenue provides useful information to investors as we use it to evaluate the operating performance of our core businesses and as a measure of sales activity at the consolidated level for Ryder System, Inc., as well as for each of our business segments. We also use segment EBT as a percentage of segment operating revenue for each business segment for the same reason. Note: FMS EBT, SCS EBT and DTS EBT, our primary measures of segment performance, are not non-GAAP measures. 

Fuel: We exclude FMS, SCS and DTS fuel from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as fuel is an ancillary service that we provide our customers, which is impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices and the costs are largely a pass-through to our customers, resulting in minimal changes in our profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by rapid changes in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on trailing market fuel costs. 

Subcontracted transportation: We also exclude subcontracted transportation from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as these services are also typically a pass-through to our customers and, therefore, fluctuations result in minimal changes to our profitability. While our SCS and DTS business segments subcontract certain transportation services to third party providers, our FMS business segment does not engage in subcontracted transportation and, therefore, this item is not applicable to FMS.

ChoiceLease liability Insurance: We exclude ChoiceLease liability insurance as we announced our plan in the first quarter of 2020 to exit the extension of our liability insurance coverage for ChoiceLease customers. The exit of this program is estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. We are excluding the revenues associated with this program for better comparability of our on-going operations.

16

Comparable Earnings Measures:

Comparable Earnings (Loss) Before Income Taxes (EBT) and Comparable Tax Rate

Comparable Earnings

Comparable Earnings per Diluted Common Share (EPS)

Adjusted Return on Equity (ROE)

Adjusted Return on Capital (ROC) and Adjusted ROC Spread

Comparable EBT, comparable earnings and comparable EPS are defined, respectively, as GAAP EBT, earnings and EPS, all from continuing operations, excluding (1) non-operating pension costs and (2) any other significant items that are not representative of our business operations. We believe these comparable earnings measures provide useful information to investors and allow for better year-over-year comparison of operating performance.

Non-operating pension costs: Our comparable earnings measures exclude non-operating pension costs, which include the amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service cost, interest cost and expected return on plan assets components of pension and postretirement benefit costs, as well as a settlement or curtailment of a plan if one has occurred. We exclude non-operating pension costs because we consider these to be impacted by financial market performance and outside the operational performance of our business.

Other Items Impacting Comparability: Our comparable and adjusted earnings measures also exclude other significant items that are not representative of our business operations as detailed in the reconciliation table below. These other significant items vary from period to period and, in some periods, there may be no such significant items. 

Calculation of comparable tax rate: The comparable provision for income taxes is computed using the same methodology as the GAAP provision for income taxes. Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated based on the statutory tax rates of the jurisdictions to which the non-GAAP adjustments relate.

Adjusted ROE: Adjusted ROE is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by adjusted average shareholders' equity and represents the rate of return on shareholders' investment. Other items impacting comparability described above are excluded, as applicable, from the calculation of net earnings and average shareholders' equity. We use adjusted ROE as an internal measure of how effectively we use the owned capital invested in our operations.

Adjusted ROC: Adjusted ROC is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by average total capital and represents the rate of return generated by the capital deployed in our business. Other items impacting comparability described above are excluded, as applicable, from the calculation of net earnings and average shareholders' equity (a component of average total capital).We use adjusted ROC as an internal measure of how effectively we use the capital invested (borrowed or owned) in our operations. Adjusted return on capital spread is calculated as the difference of the adjusted return on capital and the weighted average cost of capital.

Comparable Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization

Comparable EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations, net of tax, first adjusted to exclude the following items, all from continuing operations: (1) non-operating pension costs and (2) any other items that are not representative of our business operations (these items are the same items that are excluded from comparable earnings measures for the relevant periods and are described under Comparable Earnings Measures above) and then adjusted further for (1) interest expense, (2) income taxes, (3) depreciation, (4) used vehicle sales results and (5) amortization.

We believe comparable EBITDA provides investors with useful information, as it is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure financial performance and our ability to service debt and meet our payment obligations. In addition, we believe that the inclusion of comparable EBITDA provides consistency in financial reporting and enables analysts and investors to perform meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results. Other companies may calculate comparable EBITDA differently; therefore, our presentation of comparable EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

Comparable EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes or earnings from continuing operations determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.
