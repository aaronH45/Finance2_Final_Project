NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 

NET INCOME OF $240.9 MILLION, EARNINGS PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE OF $1.12

CHICAGO, JANUARY 21, 2021 — Northern Trust Corporation today reported fourth quarter net income per diluted common share of $1.12, compared to $1.70 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $1.32 in the third quarter of 2020. Net income was $240.9 million, compared to $371.1 million in the prior-year quarter and $294.5 million in the prior quarter. 

Fourth quarter 2020 results included the following: 

•$55.0 million of pre-tax severance-related charges (after-tax $41.2 million) in connection with a reduction in force

•$11.9 million of pre-tax occupancy expense (after-tax $8.9 million) related to an early lease exit arising from a workplace real estate strategy

•$26.8 million of tax expense related to the reversal of tax benefits previously recognized through earnings

“Northern Trust’s performance during the quarter and year demonstrated the continued strength of our company,” said Michael O’Grady, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Throughout the year, our strong capital base and liquidity profile enabled us to continue to support the needs of our clients. Full year 2020 performance resulted in revenue consistent with the prior year. Execution on our growth strategies and overall favorable equity markets drove fees and other noninterest income growth of 6%, while net interest income declined by 14% in 2020 due to persistently low interest rates. During the fourth quarter we recognized a charge of $55.0 million associated with a reduction in force, which will allow us to improve the alignment of our operational expenses with the current economic environment. We continue to focus on serving our clients with excellence, executing on our long-term priorities, driving operating efficiency and investing wisely for future profitable growth to deliver long-term value to our various stakeholders.”

NET INTEREST INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(*) Interest income, net interest income and net interest margin presented on an FTE basis are non-generally accepted accounting principle financial measures that facilitate the analysis of asset yields. Please refer to the Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent section for further detail.

Q4 2020 vs. Q3 2020

▪Net interest income on an FTE basis increased primarily due to a slightly higher net interest margin and an increase in average earning assets.

▪The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased slightly primarily due to a balance sheet mix shift and lower costs, partially offset by lower asset yields. The net interest margin also benefited from a higher FTE adjustment and recovery of interest on nonaccrual loans.

▪Average earning assets increased primarily due to higher levels of securities, partially offset by lower levels of short-term interest-bearing deposits with banks. Funding of the balance sheet reflected higher levels of client deposits.

Q4 2020 vs. Q4 2019

▪Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased primarily due to a lower net interest margin, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

N/M - Not meaningful

Q4 2020

▪The credit provision in the current quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, which relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics, partially offset by net charge-offs in the current quarter. The decrease in the collective basis reserve was driven by improved projected economic conditions relative to the prior quarter, with decreases primarily in the private client, residential real estate, and commercial real estate portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the commercial and institutional portfolio.

Q3 2020

▪The provision in the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis. The increase in the collective basis reserve was driven by projected economic conditions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related market and economic impacts, with increases in the private client, commercial real estate, and residential real estate portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in the commercial and institutional portfolio. The overall increase in the reserve on a collective basis was partially offset by a decrease in the reserve associated with loans evaluated on an individual basis.

Q4 2019

▪The credit provision in the prior-year quarter was primarily driven by an overall decrease in the inherent allowance under the previous “incurred loss” model related to changes in credit quality, partially offset by net charge-offs.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Q4 2020 vs. Q3 2020

▪Equipment and software expense increased primarily reflecting higher software disposition charges and software support costs. 

▪Occupancy expense increased primarily due to an early lease exit arising from a workplace real estate strategy and higher building operating costs.

▪Other operating expense decreased primarily due to a $43.4 million charge related to a corporate action processing error in the prior quarter, the Northern Trust-sponsored golf tournament in the prior quarter, and lower supplemental compensation plans expense. The lower supplemental compensation plans expense resulted in a related decrease in miscellaneous income reported in noninterest income. 

Q4 2020 vs. Q4 2019 

▪Compensation expense increased primarily reflecting $52.5 million of severance-related charges and higher salary expense driven by staff growth and base pay adjustments, partially offset by lower long-term performance-based incentive expense and cash-based incentives.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Average total stockholders’ equity increased $600.5 million, or 5%, to $11.5 billion from the prior-year quarter’s average of $10.9 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income since the prior-year period, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation’s share repurchase program, the net redemption of preferred stock during the first quarter of 2020, and dividend declarations. 

During the current quarter, the Corporation declared cash dividends totaling $4.7 million to preferred stockholders and cash dividends totaling $146.8 million to common stockholders. As the Corporation suspended its open-market share repurchase program on March 16, 2020, the only shares repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2020 were 13,968 shares of common stock withheld upon the vesting of share-based compensation at a total cost of $1.3 million ($90.62 average price per share) to satisfy tax withholding obligations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Corporation repurchased 3,276,589 shares of common stock, including 532,713 shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at a total cost of $299.8 million ($91.49 average price per share).

RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT

The following table presents a reconciliation of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-generally accepted accounting financial measures. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
