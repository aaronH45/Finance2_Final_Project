CEO Comments

“We believe the financial and operational resiliency of our business was demonstrated throughout the challenging economic environment in 2020. Our success during the year was largely due to the strength of our partnerships with all stakeholders, including our dedicated and diligent team, our valued clients, and our loyal shareholders,” said Sumit Roy, Realty Income’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “During the year, we invested over $2.3 billion in high-quality real estate leased primarily to leading operators in resilient industries, of which approximately $921 million was invested internationally, where we continue to expand our addressable market in alignment with our strategic growth objectives.”

“Throughout 2020, we maintained a strong financial position and enhanced our financial flexibility, as we established a $1.0 billion commercial paper program and completed our debut public offering of Sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes. In total, we issued approximately $4.1 billion of long-term and permanent capital, which included record-low USD coupon rates in the REIT sector for the 5-year and 12-year unsecured notes issued in December 2020. Based on the strength of our financial position and investment pipeline, we project 2021 acquisition volume of over $3.25 billion, translating into 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49.” 

Summarized Financial Results

The following summarizes our select financial results (dollars in millions, except per share data):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The calculation to determine net income attributable to common stockholders includes provisions for impairment, gains on sales of real estate, and foreign currency gains and losses. These items can vary from quarter to quarter and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders and period to period comparisons.

(2) Our financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by the following transactions: (i) $147.2 million of provisions for impairment, (ii) $52.5 million in reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue, (iii) a $9.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt due to the January 2020 early redemption of the 5.750% notes due 2021, and (iv) a $3.5 million executive severance charge for our former CFO. 

(3) FFO and AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the Glossary in our supplemental materials for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 for definitions and explanations of how we utilize these metrics. See pages 10 and 11 herein for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 

Impact of COVID-19

Percentages of Contractual Rent Collected as of January 31, 2021

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Collection rates are calculated as the aggregate contractual rent collected for the applicable period from the beginning of that applicable period through January 31, 2021, divided by the contractual rent charged for the applicable period. Rent collection percentages are calculated based on contractual rents (excluding percentage rents and contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients). Charged amounts have not been adjusted for any COVID-19 related rent relief granted and include contractual rents from any clients in bankruptcy. Due to differences in applicable foreign 

- 2 -

currency conversion rates and rent conventions, the percentages above may differ from percentages calculated utilizing our total portfolio annualized contractual rent.

(2) We define our top 20 clients as our 20 largest clients based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent as of December 31, 2020 for all periods.

(3) Please see the Glossary in our supplemental materials for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 for the definition of our investment grade clients.

We either have executed deferral agreements or maintain ongoing deferral discussions with clients that account for a majority of the unpaid contractual rent for each of the periods referenced in the table above. Additional detail on rent collections can be found in our supplemental materials available on our corporate website at www.realtyincome.com/investors/financial-information/quarterly-results.

Theater Industry Update

As of December 31, 2020, our clients in the theater industry represented 5.6% of our annualized contractual rent. Given the ongoing disruption to this industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed a property-level analysis on the collectability of rent for our theater properties. Our analysis involved the assignment of quartile rankings for each asset’s pre-pandemic EBITDAR relative to each operator’s overall footprint. Other criteria utilized included an analysis of the property’s pre-pandemic annual EBITDA generation before corporate overhead, and real estate fundamentals.

As a result of this analysis at September 30, 2020, we determined that for 31 of our 78 theater properties it was no longer probable that we would collect substantially all of contractual rents due. We fully reserved for six additional theater properties for which we do not possess unit level financial information. Consequently, we reserved for 100% of the outstanding receivables for 37 theater properties at September 30, 2020. Beginning October 2020, contractual rent from these 37 properties is accounted for on a cash basis. Additionally, during November 2020, one of these properties was sold. We fully reserved for one additional theater property at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the receivables outstanding for our 77 theater properties totaled $48.6 million, net of $23.7 million of reserves, and includes $7.8 million of straight-line rent receivables, net of $1.8 million of reserves. The monthly contractual rent associated with the 37 properties accounted for under the cash basis totaled approximately $2.8 million at December 31, 2020. The following table summarizes reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue for theater properties (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Additionally, during the third quarter, we recorded provisions for impairment on 12 of the 37 theater properties for $79.0 million. During the fourth quarter, we recorded provisions for impairment on one additional theater property for $4.8 million. Impairment charges are not included in Nareit-defined FFO or in our calculation of AFFO.

See "Item 1A—Risk Factors" in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2020 for more information regarding the actual and potential future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread on our clients and our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Dividend Increases 

In December 2020, we announced the 93rd  consecutive quarterly dividend increase, which is the 109th increase in the amount of the dividend since the company’s listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1994. The annualized dividend amount as of December 31, 2020 was $2.814 per share. The amount of monthly dividends paid per share increased 3.1% to $2.794 in 2020, as compared to $2.711 in 2019. The company distributed $964.2 million in common dividends to stockholders in 2020, representing 82.2% of its AFFO of $1.173 billion.

Real Estate Portfolio Update

As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of 6,592 properties located in 49 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the U.K., and leased to approximately 600 different clients doing business in 51 separate industries. The properties are primarily freestanding and leased under long-term net lease agreements with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 9.0 years. The company's portfolio of commercial real estate has historically provided dependable rental revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends. As of December 31, 2020, portfolio occupancy was 97.9% with 140 properties available for lease or sale out of 6,592, as compared to 98.6% at each of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Investments in Real Estate

The following table summarizes our acquisitions in the U.S. and U.K. for the periods indicated below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Initial average cash lease yield is a supplemental operating measure. Please see the Glossary in our supplemental materials for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 for our definition of this metric. Contractual net operating income for the fourth quarter of 2020 includes approximately $700,000 received as a settlement credit for a property acquired in the U.S. as reimbursement of a free rent period. 

(2) Represents investments of £351.1 million Sterling during the three months ended December 31, 2020 and £707.8 million Sterling during the year ended December 31, 2020 converted at the applicable exchange rate on the date of acquisition.

(3) Our clients occupying the new properties operate in 19 industries and are 71.1% retail and 28.9% industrial, based on rental revenue. Approximately 68% of the rental revenue generated from acquisitions during the three months ended December 31, 2020 is from our investment grade rated clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies.

(4) Our clients occupying the new properties operate in 26 industries and are 86.6% retail and 13.4% industrial, based on rental revenue. Approximately 61% of the rental revenue generated from acquisitions during 2020 is from our investment grade rated clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies.

Same Store Rental Revenue 

The following summarizes our same store rental revenue on 5,403 properties under lease (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our calculation of same store rental revenue includes rent deferred for future payment as a result of lease concessions we granted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and recognized under the practical expedient provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Same store rental revenue was negatively impacted by reserves recorded as reductions of rental revenue of $13.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $126,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, and $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our calculation of same store rental revenue also includes uncollected rent for which we have not granted a lease concession. If these applicable amounts of rent deferrals and uncollected rent were excluded from our calculation of same store rental revenue, the decreases for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the comparable periods for 2019 would have been (3.6)% and (5.1)%, respectively.

During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we raised $655.0 million from the sale of common stock at a weighted average price of $61.14 per share, primarily through our At-The-Market (ATM) Program.

In January 2021, we raised $669.6 million from the issuance of 12,075,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering, including 1,575,000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares.

As of December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. In addition, we had a cash balance of $824.5 million.

Additionally, we have a U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured commercial paper program.

We use our unsecured revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of the notes issued under this program. As of December 31, 2020, we had no commercial paper borrowings. 

Early Redemption of 3.250% Notes Due 2022

In January 2021, we completed the early redemption on all $950.0 million in principal amount of our outstanding 3.250% notes due October 2022, plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of the early redemption, we will recognize a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $46 million, or approximately $0.12 per diluted common share, to net income available to common stockholders and Nareit-defined FFO in the three months ended March 31, 2021. Loss on extinguishment of debt is excluded in our calculation of AFFO.
