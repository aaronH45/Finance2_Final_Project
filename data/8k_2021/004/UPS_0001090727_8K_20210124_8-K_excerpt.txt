Completion of the transaction is subject to certain customary regulatory and other approvals and conditions. In connection with the entry into the agreement, UPS has determined that an impairment triggering event has occurred as of the December 31, 2020 balance sheet date. As a result, UPS expects to recognize a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $500 million on its statement of consolidated income for the year ended December 31, 2020.
