In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Company assumed the contingent value rights related to Celgene’s Abraxane® and Abraxis pipeline products granted by Celgene to certain holders thereof pursuant to that certain Contingent Value Rights Agreement, dated as of October 15, 2010 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “CVR Agreement”), between Equiniti Trust Company (the “Trustee,” as successor to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC) and the Company (as successor in interest to Celgene). 

On February 19, 2021, the Company notified the Trustee that the net sales for Abraxane for the year ended December 31, 2020 as recorded in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 of the Company is $1,246,656,798 and the Net Sales Payment (as defined under the CVR Agreement) in the amount of approximately $6,166,420 will be paid to the Trustee on or before March 8, 2021 in accordance with Section 3.1 of the CVR Agreement.
