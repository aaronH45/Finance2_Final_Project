The Offerors’ obligations to accept Notes tendered in the Offers are subject to the terms and conditions described in the Offer to Purchase dated February 4, 2021 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer to Purchase”) which sets forth a detailed description of the Offers, including (i) the Acceptance Priority Procedures (as defined in the Offer to Purchase”)), (ii) a $950 million maximum aggregate purchase price of the 2023 Pool Notes validly tendered in the 2023 Pool Offers, excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (as defined below) (the “2023 Pool Maximum”), (iii) a $1.5 billion maximum aggregate purchase price of the 2024 Pool Notes validly tendered in the 2024 Pool Offers, excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (the “2024 Pool Maximum”), (iv) a $650 million maximum aggregate purchase price of the 2025 Pool Notes validly tendered in the 2025 Pool Offers, excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (the “2025 Pool Maximum”), and (v) a $900 million maximum aggregate purchase price of the High Coupon Pool Notes validly tendered in the High Coupon Pool Offers, excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (the “High Coupon Pool Maximum”). 

The withdrawal rights for the Offers expired at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on February 18, 2021. All conditions of the Offers were deemed satisfied or waived by the Offerors by the Early Tender Deadline. The Offerors have elected to exercise their Early Settlement Right (as defined in the Offer to Purchase). The Early Settlement Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) will occur on February 23, 2021. The Offers will each expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on March 4, 2021, unless extended or earlier terminated by the Offerors.

All Holders of Notes (each, a “Holder” and collectively, “Holders”) whose Notes are accepted in an Offer will receive a cash payment equal to accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes to, but not including, the relevant Settlement Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) (the “Accrued Coupon Payment”) in addition to their Total Consideration or Tender Consideration, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, interest will cease to accrue on the Settlement Date for all Notes accepted in the Offers. Under no circumstances will any interest be payable to Holders because of any delay on the part of Global Bondholder Services Corporation, as the tender agent and information agent, The Depository Trust Company or any other party in the transmission of funds to Holders. See the Offer to Purchase for additional information. 

All Notes accepted in the Offers will be cancelled and retired and will no longer remain outstanding obligations of the relevant Offeror.
