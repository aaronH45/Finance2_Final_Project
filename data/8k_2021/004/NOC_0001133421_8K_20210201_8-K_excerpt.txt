On February 1, 2021, Northrop Grumman Corporation (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing that it has entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) to repurchase $2 billion of the Company’s common stock. The ASR agreement was entered into pursuant to the Company’s current share repurchase authorization. 

Approximately 5.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock to be repurchased under the transaction will be received by the Company on February 2, 2021. The final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the term of the transaction, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms of the ASR agreement, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. At settlement, Goldman Sachs may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to the Company, or, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to deliver shares of its common stock or may elect to make a cash payment to Goldman Sachs. 

A copy of the Company’s press release entitled “Northrop Grumman Announces $2 Billion Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement” is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
