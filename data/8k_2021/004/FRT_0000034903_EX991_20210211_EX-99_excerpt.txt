Certain matters discussed within this Supplemental Information may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained. These factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 11, 2021, and include the following:

•risks that our tenants will not pay rent, may vacate early or may file for bankruptcy or that we may be unable to renew leases or re-let space at favorable rents as leases expire;

•risks that we may not be able to proceed with or obtain necessary approvals for any redevelopment or renovation project, and that completion of anticipated or ongoing property redevelopment or renovation projects that we do pursue may cost more, take more time to complete or fail to perform as expected;

•risk that we are investing a significant amount in ground-up development projects that may be dependent on third parties to deliver critical aspects of certain projects, requires spending a substantial amount upfront in infrastructure, and assumes receipt of public funding which has been committed but not entirely funded; 

•risks normally associated with the real estate industry, including risks that occupancy levels at our properties and the amount of rent that we receive from our properties may be lower than expected, that new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected, that competition for acquisitions could result in increased prices for acquisitions, that costs associated with the periodic maintenance and repair or renovation of space, insurance and other operations may increase, that environmental issues may develop at our properties and result in unanticipated costs, and, because real estate is illiquid, that we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate;

•risks that our growth will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital;

•risks of financing on terms which are acceptable to us, our ability to meet existing financial covenants and the limitations imposed on our operations by those covenants, and the possibility of increases in interest rates that would result in increased interest expense;

•risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust, commonly referred to as a REIT, for federal income tax purposes, such as the existence of complex tax regulations relating to our status as a REIT, the effect of future changes in REIT requirements as a result of new legislation, and the adverse consequences of the failure to qualify as a REIT; and

•risks related to natural disasters, climate change and public health crises (such as the outbreak and worldwide spread of COVID-19), and the measures that international, federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and/or health authorities implement to address them, my precipitate or materially exacerbate one or more the above-mentioned risks, and my significantly disrupt or prevent us from operating our business in the ordinary course for an extended period.

Federal Realty Investment Trust Announces Operating Results for the Year and Quarter Ended 

December 31, 2020

NORTH BETHESDA, Md. (February 11, 2021) - Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) today reported operating results for its year and quarter ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net income available for common shareholders was $1.62 per diluted share and $4.61 per diluted share, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net income available for common shareholders was $1.22 per diluted share and $1.92 per diluted share, respectively. 

Key Highlights of the full year and quarter include:

•Signed leases for 449,783 square feet of comparable space in the fourth quarter at an average rent of $32.16 psf and achieved cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 1%. 

•Sold three properties for combined gross proceeds of $170 million in the fourth quarter.  

•Executed inaugural green offering, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.250% notes at an effective yield of 1.379%, maturing February 15, 2026.

•Ended the quarter with $798 million of cash on hand, $1.0 billion of availability on its revolving credit facility and no public bonds maturing until 2023. 

•Generated funds from operations available for common shareholders (FFO) per diluted share of $4.38 for the year ($4.52 excluding the $11.2 million early extinguishment of debt charge) compared to $6.17 in 2019 ($6.33 excluding the $11.9 million charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly). For the fourth quarter, generated FFO per diluted share of $0.99 ($1.14 excluding the early extinguishment of debt charge) compared to $1.58 for the fourth quarter 2019.

“While COVID certainly weighed on our quarterly and yearly results, the sheer volume of leasing and other transactions that we executed at the end of last year along with the continuing strong leasing demand for our real 

3

estate as evidenced by the many substantive discussions we’re having with prospective tenants today set us up extremely well for a post COVID recovery as vaccinations are delivered to a large segment of the population,” said Donald C. Wood, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe that Federal’s high-quality open-air shopping centers and mixed-use communities located in the first-tier suburbs of major metropolitan markets are the center of the bulls eye in terms of tenant desirability.”

Financial Results

For the full year 2020, Federal Realty reported net income available for common shareholders of $123.7 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.62, which includes the $50.7 million net impairment charge relating to The Shops at Sunset Place and the $11.2 million early extinguishment of debt charge. This compares to net income available for common shareholders of $345.8 million and earnings per diluted share of $4.61 for the full year 2019. Net income available for common shareholders was $92.7 million and earnings per diluted share was $1.22 for the fourth quarter 2020 which includes the $11.2 million early extinguishment of debt charge versus $145.3 million and $1.92, respectively, for the fourth quarter 2019. 

For the full year 2020, Federal Realty generated funds from operations available for common shareholders (FFO) of $333.8 million, or $4.38 per diluted share ($4.52 excluding the $11.2 million early extinguishment of debt charge). This compares to FFO of $465.8 million, or $6.17 per diluted share ($6.33 excluding the $11.9 million charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly) for the full year 2019. For the fourth quarter 2020, FFO was $75.1 million, or $0.99 per diluted share ($1.14 excluding the early extinguishment of debt charge), compared to $120.0 million, or $1.58 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2019.

The year-over-year decreases in net income and FFO were attributable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic with the primary driver being collectibility related impacts totaling $106.6 million, or $1.40 per share, which included a $12.7 million impact to straight-line rent for the full year 2020. For the fourth quarter 2020, collectibility related impacts totaled $18.9 million, or $0.25 per share, which included a $1.6 million impact to straight-line rent.

FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the Trust considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance.  A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.

Portfolio Results

The portfolio was 92.2% leased as of December 31, 2020, and the comparable portfolio was 92.1% leased. 

For the year 2020, Federal Realty signed 336 leases for 1.8 million square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), Federal Realty leased 1.7 million square feet at an average rent of $31.53 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $30.76 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases, representing a cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 3%, 12% on a straight-line basis.

During the fourth quarter 2020, Federal Realty signed 103 leases for 468,901 square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), Federal Realty leased 449,783 square feet at an average rent of $32.16 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $31.95 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases, representing a cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 1%, 11% on a straight-line basis.

COVID-19 Operational Update

All 101 properties remain open and operating. Approximately 98% of our retail tenants based on annualized base rent are open and operating as of January 31, 2021. Annualized base rent reflects the aggregate, annualized in-place contractual (defined as rents billed on a cash basis without taking the impact of rent abatements into account) minimum rent for all occupied commercial spaces. 

As of January 31, 2021, the Company has collected approximately 89% of total fourth quarter 2020 billed recurring rents. 

With $798 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, Federal Realty has approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity in cash and undrawn availability under its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. 

Additional information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business to date is available in a presentation posted on the Investor section of Federal Realty’s website.

Notes:

1)See Glossary of Terms.

2)Impairment charge relates to The Shops at Sunset Place and was recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Amount is net of the allocation to noncontrolling interests.

3)For the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, dividends on our Series 1 preferred stock were not deducted in the calculation of FFO available to common shareholders, as the related shares were dilutive and included in "weighted average common shares, diluted."

4)For the three months ended December 31, 2020, income attributable to operating partnership units is not added back in the calculation of FFO available to common shareholders, as the related shares are not dilutive and are not included in "weighted average common shares, diluted" for this period. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, the weighted average common shares used to compute FFO per diluted common share include operating partnership units that were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. Conversion of these operating partnership units is dilutive in the computation of FFO per diluted share but anti-dilutive for the computation of dilutive EPS for these periods.

5)FFO available for common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $11.2 million charge related to early extinguishment of debt, and for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes an $11.9 million charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly Row Marketplace. If these charges were excluded, our FFO, FFO per diluted share, and dividend payout ratio as a percentage of FFO at each respective year end would have been:

COVID-19 Related Impacts

December 31, 2020

The following provides supplemental information regarding our collectibility related impacts resulting from COVID-19 for the three months ended December 31, 2020. The primary drivers of our collectibility impacts in the quarter are from tenants who we account for on a cash basis or converted to a cash basis of accounting during the quarter, as we did not receive full contractual rent payments, as well as COVID-19 related rent abatements. We change a tenant to a cash basis of accounting when we determine collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is not considered probable; revenue is then limited to the lesser of revenue recognized under accrual accounting or cash received. Our full revenue recognition policy with respect to leases can be found in Note 2 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Collectibility Impacts for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2020

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

1)Approximately 85% of this impact is from restaurants, fitness, and entertainment tenants.

2)This balance reflects rent abatements granted as a result of COVID-19, as well as changes in assumptions of collectibility primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. Approximately 55% of the impact is due to tenants where we do not believe it is probable we will collect the remaining contractual lease payments.

16

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

1)Mortgages payable does not include our share of debt on our unconsolidated real estate partnerships. At December 31, 2020, our share of unconsolidated debt was approximately $53.3 million, of which $25.2 million was repaid on January 4, 2021 when we acquired our partner's 20% interest in our joint venture arrangement related to the Pike & Rose hotel. See page 22 for additional information on this transaction. At December 31, 2020, our noncontrolling interests' share of mortgages payable was $47.8 million.

2)This mortgage loan was repaid prior to its original maturity date on February 5, 2021, at par.

3)We have two interest rate swap agreements that fix the interest rate on the mortgage loan at 3.67%.

4)The interest rates on these mortgages range from 3.91% to 5.00%.

5)This mortgage loan has a fixed interest rate, however, the rate resets every five years until maturity. The current interest rate is fixed until July 1, 2022 and the loan is prepayable at par anytime after this date.

6)During the three months ended December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings on our revolving credit facility.

7)The weighted average remaining term on our mortgages payable, notes payable, and senior notes and debentures, is 9 years.

8)The weighted average effective interest rate includes the amortization of any debt issuance costs and discounts and premiums if applicable, except as described in Note 9. 

9)The weighted average effective interest rate excludes $0.6 million in quarterly financing fees and debt fee amortization on our revolving credit facility.

10)Fixed charges consist of interest on borrowed funds (including capitalized interest), amortization of debt discount/premium and debt costs, and the portion of rent expense representing an interest factor. EBITDAre is reconciled to net income in the Glossary of Terms. 

11)The ratio of EBITDAre to combined fixed charges and preferred share dividends for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes the $11.9 million charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly Square Marketplace. Excluding the $11.9 million charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly Square Marketplace in 2019, our ratio of EBITDAre to combined fixed charges and preferred share dividends would have been 4.24x.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

1)On May 6, 2020, we entered into a $400.0 million unsecured term loan, which matures on May 6, 2021. We have the option to extend the loan maturity one year to May 6, 2022.

2)The total debt maturities differs from the total reported on the consolidated balance sheet due to the unamortized net premium/discount and debt issuance costs on certain mortgage loans, note payable, and senior notes as of December 31, 2020.

3)The weighted average rate reflects the weighted average interest rate on debt maturing in the respective year. 

4)The weighted average rate excludes $0.6 million in quarterly financing fees and debt fee amortization on our revolving credit facility, which had no balance outstanding at December 31, 2020. Our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility matures on January 19, 2024, plus two six month extensions at our option.

Notes:

(1) There is no guarantee that the Trust will ultimately complete any or all of these opportunities, that the Projected Return on Investment (ROI) or Projected Costs will be the amounts shown or that stabilization will occur as anticipated. The projected ROI and Projected Cost are management's best estimate based on current information and may change over time. 

(2) Projected ROI for redevelopment projects generally reflects only the deal specific cash, unleveraged incremental Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the redevelopment and is calculated as Incremental POI divided by incremental cost. Incremental POI is the POI generated by the redevelopment after deducting rent being paid or management's estimate of rent to be paid for the redevelopment space and any other space taken out of service to accommodate the redevelopment. Projected ROI for redevelopment projects does NOT include peripheral impacts, such as the impact on future lease rollovers at the property or the impact on the long-term value of the property. 

(3) Stabilization is generally the year in which 90% physical occupancy of the redeveloped space is achieved. Economic stabilization may occur at a later point in time. 

(4) All subtotals and totals reflect cost weighted-average ROIs. 

(5) Project formerly known as Jordan Downs Plaza. Cost to date and projected cost are net of the proceeds we will receive from our New Market Tax Credit structure. See Note 3 of our December 31, 2019 Form 10-K for additional information. Stabilization has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Notes:

(1)Anticipated opening dates, total cost, and projected return on investment (ROI) are subject to adjustment as a result of factors inherent in the development process, some of which may not be under the direct control of the Company. Refer to the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for other risk factors.

(2)Projected ROI for development projects reflects the unleveraged Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the development and is calculated as POI divided by cost.

(3)Projected costs for Assembly Row and Pike & Rose include an allocation of infrastructure costs for the entire project. Phase I of Santana West includes an allocation of infrastructure for the Santana West site.

(4)Federal Realty Investment Trust is leasing 45,000 square feet of office space at a market rent in Pike & Rose Phase III, which delivered in August 2020. Revenue related to this rent will be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Glossary of Terms

EBITDA for Real Estate ("EBITDAre"): EBITDAre is a non-GAAP measure that the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines as: net income computed in accordance with GAAP plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of real estate, impairments of real estate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. We calculate EBITDAre consistent with the NAREIT definition. As EBITDA is a widely known and understood measure of performance, management believes EBITDAre represents an additional non-GAAP performance measure, independent of a company's capital structure, that will provide investors with a uniform basis to measure the enterprise value of a company. EBITDAre also approximates a key performance measure in our debt covenants, but it should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDAre for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Excluding the charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly Square Marketplace, our EBITDAre would have been $611.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Funds From Operations (FFO): FFO is a supplemental measure of real estate companies' operating performances. NAREIT defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with GAAP plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on sale of real estate, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity REIT in order to recognize that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. However, FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to pay dividends. We consider FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 

Property Operating Income: Rental income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes.

Overall Portfolio: Includes all operating properties owned in reporting period.

Comparable Properties: Represents our consolidated property portfolio other than those properties that distort comparability between periods in two primary categories: (1) assets that were not owned for the full quarter in both periods presented and (2) assets currently under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment. Comparable property growth statistics are calculated on a GAAP basis. 

Annualized Base Rent (ABR): Represents aggregate, annualized in-place contractual (defined as rents billed on a cash basis without taking the impact of rent abatements into account) minimum rent for all occupied spaces as of the reporting period. 

Retail Leasing Summary - Lease Rollover Calculation: The rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed for retail space in arms-length transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period. The comparison between annual rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances, projections of first lease year percentage rent, to be paid on the new lease. In atypical circumstances, management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of rents reported in this calculation. As a result of accommodations made to certain tenants to help them to stay open during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, we have found it necessary to exercise more judgement in 2020 than in prior years in order to appropriately reflect the comparability of rents in the calculation. The change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates, location, individual tenant creditworthiness, use of space, market conditions when the expiring lease was signed, capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure. Rent abatement and short term rent restructuring agreements that are a result of COVID-19 impacts are not included in this calculation.

Tenant Improvements and Incentives: Represents not only the total dollars committed for the improvement (fit-out) of a space as it relates to a specific lease and, except for redevelopments, may also include base building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements. Costs related to redevelopments require judgment by management in determining what reflects base building cost and thus, is not included in the "tenant improvements and incentives" amount.
