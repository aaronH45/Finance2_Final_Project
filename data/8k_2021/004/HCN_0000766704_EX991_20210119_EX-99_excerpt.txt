Recent Developments Seniors Housing Operating (SHO) Portfolio Update (1) • Total SHO portfolio occupancy declined approximately 220 basis points (bps) during 4Q2020 from 78.4% to 76.2%. Month-to-date, occupancy has declined an additional 85bps, with occupancy of 75.3% as of January 15, 2021 • Occupancy remains pressured by a decline in move in activity resulting from the continued increase in COVID-19 cases and implementation of shelter in place orders across many of our geographies (2) • As expected, higher than anticipated COVID expenses, particularly those related to labor, PPE, and sanitation have resulted in 4Q2020 operating margins in the low-20% range . Operating margins will likely deteriorate further in 1Q2021, owing to the likelihood of further occupancy losses, elevated COVID-related expenses, and seasonal factors Rent Collections Update • Triple-Net Portfolio: Collected 97% of rent due in 4Q2020 (3) • Outpatient Medical (OM): Collected or approved short-term deferrals for over 99% of rent due in 4Q2020, consisting of 97% cash collections and 2% short-term deferrals COVID-19 Vaccine Update • Distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in seniors housing communities across the US commenced during the week of December 21, 2020.
