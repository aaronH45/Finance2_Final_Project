At the conclusion of this press release is a reconciliation of reported-to-adjusted results, including a description of the significant items.

Andrew Meslow, Chief Executive Officer of L Brands, stated, “Following on our record third quarter results, the exceptional efforts and execution of our team enabled us to deliver another record performance in the fourth quarter. We experienced consistent strength at Bath & Body Works along with continued significant improvement in performance at Victoria’s Secret. Looking forward, we remain focused on our strategy to deliver compelling merchandise and experiences to our customers while maintaining a safe environment. At the same time, we continue to move ahead in our plans to separate our two businesses. As a result of the collective initiatives underway, the company is well positioned to continue driving value for our shareholders.” 

First Quarter 2021 Outlook

The company is forecasting first quarter earnings per share between $0.35 and $0.45, which represents substantial growth compared to last year when stores were closed for the majority of the quarter. Due to the continued uncertainty in the environment, as well as the impending separation of the Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret businesses, targeted to occur in August 2021, the company is not providing earnings guidance for the full year 2021.

The Adjusted Financial Information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Further, the Company’s definition of adjusted income information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. While it is not possible to predict future results, management believes the adjusted information is useful for the assessment of the ongoing operations of the Company because the adjusted items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. Additionally, management uses adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. The Adjusted Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the Company’s historical financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K.
