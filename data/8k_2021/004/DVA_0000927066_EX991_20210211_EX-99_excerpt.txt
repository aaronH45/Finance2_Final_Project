DaVita Inc. 4th Quarter 2020 Results

Denver, Colorado, February 11, 2021 — DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) announced financial and operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2020. For the full year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $6.39, an increase of 38.9% from the prior year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $7.26, an increase of 34.4% from the prior year. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.67 was impacted by the challenges of responding to COVID-19, with an estimated net impact on operating income of approximately $(60) million. This impact was primarily driven by higher patient mortality, fewer offsets in the fourth quarter including higher health benefit expenses, and higher direct costs related to COVID-19.

“Throughout the pandemic, including the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases across the United States, our teammates continue to respond with a focus on the health and safety of 240,000 patients receiving high quality, life-sustaining care,” said Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita. “Over the past six weeks, we have begun providing vaccinations to our front-line caregivers, and we are now beginning the process of providing COVID-19 vaccinations to our patients.” 

Financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2020:

•Consolidated revenues of $2.905 billion and $11.551 billion for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. 

•Operating income of $382 million or 13.1% operating margin for the three months ended December 31, 2020. Operating income of $1.695 billion or 14.7% operating margin and adjusted operating income of $1.746 billion or 15.1% adjusted operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2020.

•Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.67 for the three months ended December 31, 2020. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.39 and $7.26, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

•Operating cash flow and free cash flow, both from continuing operations, of $485 million and $210 million, respectively for the three months ended December 31, 2020. Operating cash flow and free cash flow, both from continuing operations, were $1.979 billion and $1.188 billion, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2020.

U.S. dialysis metrics:

Volume: Total U.S. dialysis treatments for the fourth quarter of 2020 were 7,574,217, or an average of 95,876 treatments per day, representing a per day decline of (0.9)% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Normalized non-acquired treatment growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was (0.3)%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Primary drivers of the changes in the table above were as follows: 

Revenue: The quarter change was primarily due to increases in government revenue per treatment and in hospital inpatient dialysis services revenue due to normal seasonality and COVID-19, partially offset by a decline in calcimimetics revenue. The annual change was primarily due to an increase in Medicare rates due to a base rate increase in 2020, the temporary suspension of Medicare sequestration, as well as an increase in hospital inpatient dialysis services revenue per treatment, partially offset by a decline in calcimimetics reimbursement.

Patient care costs: The quarter change was primarily due to increases in COVID-19-related costs, including compensation expense, medical supplies and teammate reimbursement and benefit program expenses. In addition, there were increases in health benefit expenses, labor costs and other direct dialysis center operating expenses partially offset by a decrease in pharmaceutical intensity. The annual change was primarily due to decreases in pharmaceutical unit costs as well as travel expenses, partially offset by an increase in labor costs and COVID-19-related costs, including compensation expenses, medical supplies and teammate relief reimbursement and benefit program expenses.

General and administrative: The quarter change was primarily due to decreases in advocacy costs to counter union policy efforts, including a California ballot initiative and contributions to DaVita's charitable foundation partially offset by an increase in professional fees. The annual change was primarily due to increases in advocacy costs as described above, contributions to DaVita's charitable foundation, labor costs and COVID-19-related costs, including compensation expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in travel expenses and long-term incentive compensation expense.

Certain items impacting the quarter: 

Share repurchases: During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 4,193,401 shares for $417 million, at an average cost of $99.55 per share.

Subsequent to December 31, 2020 through February 10, 2021, the Company has repurchased 1,063,000 shares of our common stock for $123 million at an average cost of $115.98 per share.

Center activity: As of December 31, 2020, we provided dialysis services to a total of approximately 240,400 patients at 3,137 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,816 centers were located in the United States and 321 centers were located in ten countries outside of the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we opened a total of 14 new dialysis centers and closed seven dialysis centers in the United States. We also acquired 30 dialysis centers outside of the United States, including entering a new country, the United Kingdom, during the fourth quarter of 2020.

Outlook:

The following forward-looking measures and the underlying assumptions involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those described below, and actual results may vary materially from these forward-looking measures. In particular, the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to generate significant risk and uncertainty, and as a result, our future results could vary materially from the guidance provided below. We do not provide guidance for operating income, diluted net income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita Inc., effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations or free cash flow from continuing operations on a basis consistent with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) nor a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These non-GAAP financial measures do not include certain items, including foreign currency fluctuations, which may be significant. Our effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. also excludes the amount of third party owners' income and related taxes attributable to non-tax paying entities.

DaVita undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changed circumstances, new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Actual future events and results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things:

•the continuing impact of the dynamic and evolving COVID-19 pandemic, including, without limitation, on our patients, teammates, physician partners, suppliers, business, operations, reputation, financial condition and results of operations; the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic; the availability, acceptance, impact and efficacy of COVID-19 treatments, therapies and vaccines; further spread or resurgence of the virus, including as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus; the continuing impact of the pandemic on our revenue and non-acquired growth due to lower treatment volumes; the consequences of an extended economic downturn resulting from the impacts of COVID-19, such as a potential negative impact on our commercial mix, which may persist even after the pandemic subsides; and continuing COVID-19-related costs, such as costs to procure equipment and clinical supplies and higher salary and wage expense. The aforementioned risks and uncertainties may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties discussed below; 

•the concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number or percentage of our patients under such plans, including, without limitation, as a result of restrictions or prohibitions on the use and/or availability of charitable premium assistance, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients, or our making incorrect assumptions about how our patients will respond to any change in financial assistance from charitable organizations;

•noncompliance by us or our business associates with any privacy or security laws or any security breach by us or a third party involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information;

•the extent to which the ongoing implementation of healthcare reform, or changes in or new legislation, regulations or guidance, enforcement thereof or related litigation result in a reduction in coverage or reimbursement rates for our services, a reduction in the number of patients enrolled in higher-paying commercial plans or that are enrolled in or select Medicare Advantage plans or other material impacts to our business; or our making incorrect assumptions about how our patients will respond to any such developments;

•a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare End Stage Renal Disease program or other government-based programs and the impact of the Medicare Advantage benchmark structure;

•risks arising from potential changes in laws, regulations or requirements applicable to us, such as potential and proposed federal and/or state legislation, regulation, ballot, executive action or other initiatives, including those related to healthcare and/or labor matters, such as AB 290 in California;

•the impact of the political environment and related developments on the current healthcare marketplace and on our business, including with respect to the future of the Affordable Care Act, the exchanges and many other core aspects 

4

of the current healthcare marketplace, as well as the composition of the U.S. Supreme Court and the new presidential administration and congressional majority;

•our ability to successfully implement our strategies with respect to home-based dialysis, value-based care and/or integrated kidney care, including maintaining our existing business and further developing our capabilities in a complex and highly regulated environment;

•changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, reimbursement and payment policies and processes, or pharmaceutical pricing, including with respect to hypoxia inducible factors;

•legal and compliance risks, such as our continued compliance with complex government regulations;

•continued increased competition from dialysis providers and others, and other potential marketplace changes;

•our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates, such as accountable care organizations, independent practice associations and integrated delivery systems;

•our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might announce or be considering, on terms favorable to us or at all, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, or to successfully expand our operations and services in markets outside the United States, or to businesses outside of dialysis;

•the variability of our cash flows, including without limitation any extended billing or collections cycles; the risk that we may not be able to generate or access sufficient cash in the future to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; and the risk that we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, on terms favorable to us or at all;

•factors that may impact our ability to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and the timing of any such stock repurchases, as well as our use of a considerable amount of available funds to repurchase stock;

•risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements;

•impairment of our goodwill, investments or other assets; and

•uncertainties associated with the other risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as updated by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2020, and as may be further updated by the risks and uncertainties discussed in any subsequent reports that we file or furnish with the SEC from time to time.

The financial information presented in this release is unaudited and is subject to change as a result of subsequent events or adjustments, if any, arising prior to the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Note 1: Calculation of the Leverage Ratio

Under our senior secured credit facilities (the Credit Agreement) dated August 12, 2019, the leverage ratio is defined as (a) all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued, minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) not to exceed $750 divided by (b) “Consolidated EBITDA.” The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its Term Loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of “Consolidated EBITDA,” as of the end of the reported period and pro forma for acquisitions or divestitures that occurred during the period, and “Consolidated net debt” at the end of the reported period, each as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company’s management believes the presentation of “Consolidated EBITDA” is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the Company’s leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement. The leverage ratio calculated by the Company is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a substitute for the ratio of total debt to operating income, determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s calculation of its leverage ratio might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures of other companies.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Certain columns or rows may not sum or recalculate due to the presentation of rounded numbers.

(1)The net income measure presented is our net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc., since the Credit Agreement requires divestitures to be reflected on a pro forma basis for our leverage ratio calculation, and this measure of net income already excludes our discontinued operations divested.

(2)The debt amounts as of December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 presented exclude approximately $77.7, $80.9, and $72.8, respectively, of debt discount and other deferred financing costs related to our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes in effect at that time.

(3)This excludes amounts not readily convertible to cash related to the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans for all periods presented. The Credit Agreement limits the amount deducted for cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments, to the lesser of all unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Company or $750.

RECONCILIATIONS FOR NON-GAAP MEASURES

(unaudited)

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures

As used in this press release, the term “adjusted” refers to non-GAAP measures as follows, each as reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure as presented in the non-GAAP reconciliations in the notes to this press release: (i) for income measures, the term “adjusted” refers to operating performance measures that exclude certain items such as impairment charges, (gain) loss on ownership changes, restructuring charges, accruals for legal matters and debt prepayment and refinancing charges; and (ii) the term “effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc.” represents the Company’s effective tax rate excluding applicable non-GAAP items and noncontrolling owners’ income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities.

These non-GAAP or “adjusted” measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered alternatives to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. 

Specifically, management uses adjusted operating income, adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. and adjusted diluted net income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita Inc. to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe these non-GAAP measures also are useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. Furthermore, we believe these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. As a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normalized prior period results.

In addition, the effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities. 

The effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income and certain non-deductible and other charges which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results. Accordingly, we believe these adjusted effective income tax rates are useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to DaVita Inc.

Finally, free cash flow from continuing operations represents net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions to noncontrolling interests and all capital expenditures (including development capital expenditures, routine maintenance and information technology); plus contributions from noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the sale of self-developed properties. Management uses this measure to assess our ability to fund acquisitions and meet our debt service obligations and we believe this measure is equally useful to investors and analysts as an adjunct to cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations and other measures under GAAP.

It is important to bear in mind that these non-GAAP "adjusted" measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, nor as substitutes for, their most comparable GAAP measures. 

The following Notes 2 through 5 provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release to their most comparable GAAP measures.
