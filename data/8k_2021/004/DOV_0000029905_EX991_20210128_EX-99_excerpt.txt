MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY:

Dover’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard J. Tobin, said, “Dover delivered solid results in the fourth quarter despite lingering economic and operational effects of the pandemic. Our efficiency and productivity initiatives drove improvement in segment margins and cash flow metrics despite lower revenue for the full year. We advanced our operational priorities with 

notable progress in the center-led digital, operational, and shared back office and engineering capabilities. These initiatives have contributed to our recent results and will continue to drive improvement ahead. Our strong execution was complemented by disciplined capital allocation, including several strategic bolt-on acquisitions that enhance our businesses with new capabilities and attractive end-market exposures.

“Improving market conditions coupled with a robust demand backlog enable us to look into 2021 with constructive optimism. With continued progress in our ongoing productivity and cost initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver robust top-line growth, margin expansion and EPS accretion in 2021. We also enter the year with a healthy balance sheet that will continue to support organic and inorganic capital deployment to continue enhancing our portfolio.”

“We are pleased to have 2020 in the rear view mirror for all the obvious reasons. On behalf of Dover Corporation’s Board of Directors, I would like to thank our entire team for their extraordinary efforts in the past 12 months. We were given a unique opportunity to demonstrate the resilience of the Dover team and our business portfolio in 2020, and we can all be proud of the results we achieved together.” 

FULL YEAR 2021 GUIDANCE:

In 2021, Dover expects to generate GAAP EPS in the range of $5.42 to $5.62 (adjusted EPS of $6.25 to $6.45), based on full year revenue growth of 8% to 10% (5% to 6% on an organic basis). A full reconciliation between forecasted GAAP and forecasted adjusted measures is included as an exhibit herein.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2020

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Acquisitions

During the fourth quarter of 2020 the Company completed the acquisition of Innovative Control Systems, Inc. ("ICS") within the Fueling Solutions segment for a total consideration of $77.0 million, net of cash acquired. For the full year 2020, the Company acquired six businesses in separate transactions for total consideration of $335.8 million, net of cash acquired. The businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Engineered Products, Fueling Solutions, Imaging & Identification and Pumps & Process Solutions segments.

Discontinued and Disposed Businesses

The Company did not dispose of any businesses during the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year 2020, the Company completed the sale of the Chino, California branch of The AMS Group ("AMS Chino"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which generated total cash proceeds of $15.4 million. This sale resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of $5.2 million included within the Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment. The sale does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. 

Rightsizing and Other Costs

During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020, rightsizing activities included restructuring charges of $18.1 million and $44.5 million, respectively, and other costs of $2.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively. For the full year 2020, restructuring expense was comprised primarily of new actions executed in response to lower demand driven by COVID-19 as well as continuing broad-based selling, general and administrative expense reduction initiatives and broad-based operational efficiency initiatives focusing on footprint consolidation, and operational optimization and IT centralization. Other costs were comprised primarily of charges related to restructuring actions and asset charges, principally due to a $3.6 million write off of assets, partially offset by a $1.7 million gain on sale of assets in our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment as a result of restructuring actions. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 * Totals may be impacted by rounding.

Tax Rate

The effective tax rate was 17.4% and 14.7% for the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a full year basis, the effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 18.8% and 19.6%, respectively. The 2020 tax rate was primarily driven by the release of reserves due to the statute of limitations expiration and the tax deduction for share-based awards. The 2019 tax rate was primarily driven by the tax deduction for share-based awards and other favorable discrete items, partially offset by the exclusion of capital losses on a disposition of a business under local tax law.

Quarterly Cash Flow

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Quarterly Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)

* FY 2020 cash flow from operating activities reflects benefits from permitted deferrals of tax payments, most significantly in Q2, Q3, and Q4 and advanced payments on contracts, most significantly in Q3.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, Management also discloses non-GAAP information that Management believes provides useful information to investors. Adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted net earnings per share, total segment earnings (EBIT), adjusted EBIT by segment, adjusted EBIT margin by segment, adjusted EBITDA by segment, adjusted EBITDA margin by segment, net debt, net capitalization, net debt to net capitalization ratios, free cash flow, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow as a percentage of earnings, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, 

IS - 11

diluted net earnings per share, debt or equity, cash flows from operating activities, or revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Adjusted net earnings represents net earnings adjusted for the effect of acquisition-related amortization, rightsizing and other costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on assets held for sale and gain/loss on disposition. We exclude after-tax acquisition-related amortization because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions the Company consummates. We exclude the other items because they occur for reasons that may be unrelated to the Company's commercial performance during the period and/or Management believes they are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period. 

Adjusted diluted net earnings per share represents adjusted net earnings divided by average diluted shares. 

Total segment earnings (EBIT) is defined as net earnings before income taxes, net interest expense and corporate expenses. Total segment earnings (EBIT) margin is defined as total segment earnings (EBIT) divided by revenue.

Adjusted EBIT by Segment is defined as net earnings before income taxes, net interest expense, corporate expenses, rightsizing and other costs, a 2019 loss on assets held for sale and a 2020 gain/loss on disposition. Adjusted EBIT Margin by Segment is defined as adjusted EBIT by segment divided by segment revenue.

Adjusted EBITDA by Segment is defined as adjusted EBIT by segment plus depreciation and amortization, excluding depreciation and amortization included within rightsizing and other costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin by Segment is defined as adjusted EBITDA by segment divided by segment revenue.

Management believes these measures are useful to investors to better understand the Company’s ongoing profitability as it will better reflect the Company's core operating results, offer more transparency and facilitate easier comparability to prior and future periods and to its peers.

Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. Net debt to net capitalization ratio equals net debt divided by net capitalization. Management believes the net debt to net capitalization ratio is useful to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity. 

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings equals free cash flow divided by net earnings. Management believes that free cash flow and free cash flow ratios are important measures of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock. 

Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, provides a useful comparison of our revenue and bookings performance and trends between periods.

Performance Measures Definitions

Bookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends. 

Organic bookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisition and dispositions. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends. 

Backlog represents an estimate of the total remaining bookings at a point in time for which performance obligations have not yet have satisfied. This metric is useful as it represents the aggregate amount we expect to recognize as revenue in the future. 

We use the above operational metrics in monitoring the performance of the business. We believe the operational metrics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in assessing the performance of our segments.
