Notable items

•Continuation of productivity initiatives: $133 million of repositioning charges in 4Q20 expected to drive savings of approximately $150 million in 2021(e) due to automation of processes and organizational simplification enabling workforce rationalization, as well as real estate footprint optimization.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(e) As previously announced, we temporarily suspended reduction in force actions in 2020 as a result of the global pandemic. Expected FY2021 savings reflect the impact of those actions previously suspended as well as those announced this quarter.

(f) A cash tender offer was completed in 4Q19 of approximately $297 million of our $800 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2047, resulting in a gain of approximately $44M.

Stock purchases may be made using various types of transactions, including open-market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing of stock purchases, type of transaction and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including market conditions and State Street’s capital position, its financial performance, the amount of common stock issued as part of employee compensation programs, investment opportunities and the potential for regulatory limitations on capital actions. The common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.

REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Servicing fees increased 1% compared to 4Q19, primarily driven by higher average market levels, partially offset by normal pricing headwinds, softness in recent sales, and client activity/adjustments. Servicing fees were relatively flat compared to 3Q20, as higher average market levels and moderate net new business offset client activity/adjustments and normal pricing headwinds.

Management fees(i) increased 3% compared to 4Q19, primarily due to higher average market levels and ETF inflows, partially offset by net institutional and timing of cash outflows. Management fees increased 3% compared to 3Q20, primarily driven by higher average market levels, partially offset by net institutional and timing of cash outflows.

Net interest income (NII) decreased (22)% compared to 4Q19, primarily due to lower market rates, partially offset by growth in deposits, the investment portfolio and loan balances, and episodic market-related benefits in 4Q20. NII increased 4% compared to 3Q20, mainly driven by the absence of a 3Q20 true-up of $(20) million(c), growth in deposits, the investment portfolio and loan balances, and episodic market-related benefits in 4Q20, partially offset by the impact of low market rates.

Total revenues were positively impacted by FX translation when compared to 4Q19 and 3Q20 by $38 million and $12 million, respectively.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net provisions for credit losses, calculated under the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting standard, was nil in both 4Q20 and 3Q20, reflecting relatively stable economic forecasts and limited negative credit migrations.

EXPENSES 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compensation and employee benefits decreased (1)% compared to 4Q19, primarily driven by lower repositioning charges, lower headcount in high cost locations and contractor spend, partially offset by higher headcount in global hubs. Compensation and employee benefits was up 6% compared to 3Q20, primarily reflecting the 4Q20 repositioning charges and higher medical costs, partially offset by lower contractor spend and incentive compensation. Excluding repositioning charges, Compensation and employee benefits was flat compared to 4Q19 and decreased (1)% as compared to 3Q20(k).

Information systems and communications increased 9% compared to 4Q19, mainly reflecting higher software costs and technology infrastructure investments. Information systems and communications was flat compared to 3Q20.

Transaction processing services increased 6% compared to 4Q19 and 10% compared to 3Q20 primarily due to higher market data volumes and sub-custody balances.

(k) Compensation and benefits expenses in 4Q20 and 4Q19 included notable items related to repositioning charges of $82 million and $98 million, respectively. Excluding these notable items, 4Q20 adjusted Compensation and benefits of $1,047 million was flat compared to 4Q19 adjusted Compensation and benefits of $1,047 million and down (1)% compared to 3Q20 Compensation and benefits of $1,062 million.

Excluding repositioning charges, Occupancy was down (3)% as compared to 4Q19 and up 2% as compared to 3Q20(l).

Other expenses decreased (41)% compared to 4Q19, mainly driven by the absence of 4Q19 notable items, and lower marketing and travel spend, partially offset by higher professional fees. Other expenses were up 15% compared to 3Q20, mainly due to higher marketing and professional fees.

The effective tax rate in 4Q20 increased to 16.1% from 11.6% in 4Q19. The lower 4Q19 tax rate was primarily due to foreign legal entity restructuring and the associated impact on our deferred tax position. Compared to 3Q20, the effective tax rate decreased from 18.5% primarily due to increased realization of foreign tax benefits.

Total expenses were adversely impacted by FX translation when compared to 4Q19 and 3Q20 by $24 million and $12 million, respectively.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY

The following table presents preliminary estimated regulatory capital ratios for State Street Corporation.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Standardized capital ratios were binding for the period. The standardized CET1 ratio increased to 12.3% as compared to 11.7% in 4Q19 primarily due to higher retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in risk weighted assets primarily due to higher client lending activity. Compared to 3Q20, the CET1 ratio was relatively flat. 

The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 6.4% as compared to 6.9% in 4Q19 mainly due to an increase in adjusted average assets driven by higher deposits, partially offset by higher retained earnings. Compared to 3Q20, the Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 0.2% points.

IN THIS NEWS RELEASE:

•Expenses and other measures are sometimes presented excluding notable items. This is a non-GAAP presentation. See the Addendum to this News Release for an explanation and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures. 

•New asset servicing mandates, including announced front-to-back investment servicing clients, may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals. New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and is not yet installed. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with State Street, which from time to time may be significant. 

•New business in assets to be serviced is reflected in our AUC/A after we begin servicing the assets, and new business in assets to be managed is reflected in our AUM after we begin managing the assets. As such, only a portion of any new asset servicing and asset management mandates may be reflected in our AUC/A and AUM as of any particular date specified. Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. We provide a range of services to our clients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration and middle office services, and the nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees. The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients. The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins or new servicing business yet to be installed, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A can vary materially. Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM and differ based upon the nature, type and investment strategy of the investment product. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.

•CRD annual recurring revenue (ARR) is calculated by annualizing current quarter revenue and includes annualized amount of most software-enabled revenue, including revenue generated from Software-as-a-service, maintenance and support revenue, revenue from the Charles River Network's FIX Network Service (CRN), and value-added services, which are all expected to be recognized ratably over the term of client contracts. ARR excludes software-enabled brokerage revenue. ARR of $190 million, $213 million, and $223 million in 4Q19, 3Q20, and 4Q20, respectively, includes annualized intercompany revenues of approximately $8 million, $15 million, and $21 million, respectively.

•CRD revenue derived from affiliate agreements is eliminated in consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For 4Q20, on a consolidated basis, CRD revenue contributed $106 million, including $103 million in Software and processing fees and $3 million in FX trading services.

•Revenue and pre-tax income reflects the application of ASC 606. Revenue recognition under ASC 606 results in the acceleration of a significant portion of revenues for on-premises software agreements when a client goes live or renews their contract with us. The amount of revenue recognized in any given quarter will be driven in large part by client activity, including agreements that renew or are installed in that quarter.

•Unless otherwise noted, all capital ratios referenced on this News Release and elsewhere in this presentation refer to State Street Corporation, or State Street, and not State Street Bank and Trust Company, or State Street Bank. The lower of capital ratios calculated under the Basel III advanced approaches and under the Basel III standardized approach are applied in the assessment of our capital adequacy for regulatory purposes. Standardized ratios were binding for 4Q20. Refer to the Addendum included with this News Release for additional information. All capital ratios are estimated as of January 19, 2021. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is a preliminary estimate based on a quarterly daily average.

•All earnings per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share.

•Return on average common shareholders' equity is determined by dividing annualized net income available to common equity by average common shareholders' equity for the period.

•Quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) is a sequential quarter comparison. Year-on-year (YoY) is the current period compared to the same period a year ago.

•"AUC/A" denotes Assets Under Custody and/or Administration; "AUC" denotes Assets Under Custody; "AUM" denotes Assets Under Management; "nm" denotes not meaningful; "EOP" denotes end of period.

•"FTE" denotes fully taxable-equivalent basis; NIM is presented on an FTE-basis. Refer to the Addendum for reconciliations of our FTE-basis presentation.

•Industry data is provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to reflect State Street's or its clients' activity and is indicative of only selected segments of the entire industry.

◦Data providers for North America and EMEA industry flows were changed to Morningstar from other providers in 3Q20 for consistency across regions and other efficiency considerations. Data collection and tabulation methodologies among data providers differ. All periods presented reflect data sourced from Morningstar. Prior period data therefore differs from data previously presented, which was sourced from other data providers. Industry data is provided for illustrative purposes only.

◦Morningstar data includes long-term mutual funds, ETF’s and Money Market funds. Mutual fund data represents estimates of net new cash flow, which is new sales minus redemptions combined with net exchanges, while ETF data represents net issuance, which is gross issuance less gross redemptions. Data for Fund of Funds, Feeder funds and Obsolete funds were excluded from the series to prevent double counting. Data is from the Morningstar Direct Asset Flows database.

◦The long-term fund flows reported by Morningstar in North America are composed of US domiciled Market flows mainly in Equities, Allocation and Fixed Income asset classes. 4Q20 data for North America (US domiciled) includes Morningstar actuals October and November and Morningstar estimates for December 2020.

◦The long-term funds flows reported by Morningstar direct in EMEA are composed of the European market flows mainly in Equities, Allocation and Fixed Incomes asset classes. 4Q20 data for Europe is on a rolling three month basis for September 2020 through November 2020, sourced by Morningstar.

•We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on January 1, 2020, Allowance for Credit Losses. Prior to 2020, we recognized an allowance for loan losses under an incurred loss model.

◦Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the provision for unfunded commitments was recorded within other expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 in 1Q20, the entire provision for credit losses is recorded within provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. For purposes of this presentation on a like-for-like basis, the provision for credit losses includes $3 million of unfunded commitments in 4Q19 included within other expenses. See Allowance for credit losses within the Addendum to this News Release.

◦The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments is included within Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Condition.
