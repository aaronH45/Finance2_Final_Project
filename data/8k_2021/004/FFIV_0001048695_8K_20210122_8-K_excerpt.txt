  Item 2.01   Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.    

As previously disclosed, on January 5, 2021, F5 Networks, Inc., a Washington corporation (“F5”) entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Volterra, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Volterra”), Voyager Merger Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of F5 (“Merger Sub”) and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as security holder representative. The transaction closed on January 22, 2021. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the transaction was structured as a merger of Merger Sub with and into Volterra (the “Merger”), with Volterra surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of F5. 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at or around the effective time of the Merger, F5 paid or will pay an aggregate amount of consideration worth approximately $440,000,000 in cash and approximately $60,000,000 in deferred consideration and assumed unvested incentive compensation to founders and employees, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement, for all of the shares of Volterra (excluding shares (i) owned by Volterra or any subsidiary of Volterra and (ii) held by Volterra shareholders who perfect their dissenters’ rights with respect to the Merger) and all of the other outstanding equity securities of Volterra (the “Merger Consideration”). F5 also assumed all unvested and outstanding Volterra options, restricted stock units and restricted share awards held by continuing employees of Volterra, with restricted share awards converted into deferred cash awards. All unvested and outstanding Volterra options and restricted stock units held by non-continuing employees of Volterra were cancelled without consideration. All unvested and outstanding shares of Volterra restricted stock held by non-continuing employees of Volterra were repurchased by Volterra at the cost such non-continuing employee paid for such share of Volterra restricted stock. 

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 7, 2021 and is incorporated by reference herein.
