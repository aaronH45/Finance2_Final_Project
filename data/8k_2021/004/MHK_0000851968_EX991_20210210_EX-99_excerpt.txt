Net earnings excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges were $631 million and EPS was $8.83. For the 2020 twelve-month period, net sales were $9.6 billion, a decrease of 4.2% versus prior year as reported or 3.9% on a constant currency and days basis.

Commenting on Mohawk Industries’ fourth quarter performance, Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum, Chairman and CEO, stated, “Our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations as we posted our highest ever quarterly sales. All of our markets saw strengthening residential purchases, with laminate, LVT and sheet vinyl outperforming other flooring categories. Commercial activity remains weak and impacted sales and margins in the businesses where we have significant participation. Our results improved with higher volumes, restructuring initiatives and leverage on costs, while being adversely affected by lower runs and inventory, higher absenteeism and labor shortages in some operations. We are also seeing greater inflationary pressures in many product categories, and we are increasing prices to recover. We are mitigating the spread of Covid among our employees and customers by utilizing best practices across the business, including testing and tracking employees with potential contacts.

“Through the fourth quarter we have achieved about $50 million of the projected $100 to $110 million in anticipated savings from our restructuring initiatives. We continue to assess some projects based on changing market conditions. Our free cash flow for the period was about $250 million after capital investments of approximately $160 million, and for the year our record free cash flow exceeded $1.3 billion. After paying off our short-term debt and prefunding our longer-term maturities in the second quarter, our net debt leverage is at a historical low. Our strong financial position gives us flexibility to pursue additional opportunities, including internal investments, acquisitions and stock purchases. Since the third quarter, we have acquired approximately one million shares of our stock for $130 million as part of our stock repurchase plan.

“For the quarter, our Flooring Rest of the World Segment’s sales increased 20% as reported and 13% on a constant currency and days basis. The segment’s operating income grew over 60% with a margin of 17.5% as reported and 18.2%, excluding restructuring costs due to higher volumes and better productivity as well as favorable material costs. Sales and margins were strong in most categories and geographies with most of our plants operating near capacity. Raw material costs began to rise in many of our product categories, and we are taking pricing actions to respond to the increases. Laminate, the segment’s largest flooring category, delivered significant growth across most of our markets. Our margins increased as higher volumes drove greater absorption, while increased productivity and better throughputs enhanced our results. Our LVT sales increased substantially, led by accelerated growth of our rigid collections. Both our LVT margins and profitability improved due to increased volume, lower production costs and SG&A absorption. We are introducing new collections with enhanced visuals and exclusive water-tight joints that better prevent water damage. Our sheet vinyl business rebounded as our retailers re-opened their shops and our export markets picked up. Our greenfield Russian sheet vinyl plant’s volume has grown to a level that its margins are in line with our other businesses. Our wood panels business performed well in the period, with sales limited by our capacity and low inventories. We are expanding our capacity and increasing efficiency in melamine products to further improve our margins. In insulation, volume was good, with margins impacted by significant material inflation due to supply constraints. Our sales in Australia and New Zealand were strong, and margins improved with higher volume and lower material cost given their longer supply chain. We enhanced our market position with more aggressive sales initiatives and by providing more consistent service under difficult circumstances. 

“For the quarter, our Global Ceramic Segment’s sales increased 7% as reported and 6% on a constant currency and days basis. The segment had an operating margin of 8.7% as reported and 9.5%, excluding restructuring cost. Operating income increased by over 50% as reported versus prior year and by 65%, excluding restructuring charges, primarily due to improved productivity, increased volume and lower shutdown cost, partially offset by unfavorable price and mix. Our U.S. business delivered strong residential sales growth while commercial sales remain challenged as businesses defer investments. Our service centers are experiencing improved customer traffic due to higher home sales and remodeling activity. We have announced price increases across most collections to pass through higher transportation costs. Our plant productivity and costs improved during the period due to higher volumes and continued process improvements. We expect to complete our planned plant consolidations by the end of the first quarter. Sales of our quartz products are growing significantly, and we are increasing our mix with higher stylized products. Our Brazilian and Mexican businesses delivered record quarterly sales and expanded margins even with inflationary headwinds and capacity constraints. In both markets, margins improved due to higher productivity, and we have implemented price increases to cover rising inflation. We are investing to further upgrade our Brazilian manufacturing assets this year. Our European sales and profitability improved with residential sales stronger and lower commercial sales negatively impacting our mix and margins. Our service levels improved with the plants operating at higher rates though inventories remained low due to higher demand. Our Russian ceramic business delivered strong results, even with inflation and currency headwinds. Sales rose significantly in all channels and were led by new residential construction. We are successfully ramping up our premium sanitaryware manufacturing to expand our product offering in our owned and franchised stores.

“During the quarter, our Flooring North America Segment’s sales increased 3% as reported and were flat on a constant days basis. The segment had an operating margin of 8.6% as reported and 9.5%, excluding restructuring cost. Operating income increased by over 25% excluding restructuring charges, primarily due to productivity, increased volume and lower material costs, partially offset by unfavorable price and mix. The segment had strong growth in the residential channel, offset by lower commercial which improved from its low base in the prior periods. Our service levels improved as we increased production, though high demand required allocating shipments of some products. Due to higher demand and Covid disruptions in our plants, our inventories did not grow as we anticipated. We are taking pricing actions in most products due to rising material, labor and transportation costs. We have executed a large part of our restructuring initiatives, which is benefiting our results with some of the savings flowing through inventory in future periods. Demand for our residential carpet grew as comfort and noise reduction have become more important to consumers. Our laminate business is growing substantially in all channels as our unique visuals and waterproof technology have become desirable alternatives to natural wood and LVT. Our laminate plants are running at capacity to meet the exceptional demand, and by the end of the year a new line should be operational with additional capabilities. We have repurposed a plant to manufacture a waterproof wood flooring with dramatically improved scratch, dent and wear resistance. Sales of our LVT and sheet vinyl increased substantially, and we are introducing updated residential and commercial LVT collections with our water tight technology that will improve our mix and margins. Engineers from our European business are working in our U.S. LVT operations to implement demonstrated improvements to increase output, reduce material cost and enhance product visuals and performance.

“Our fourth quarter sales and operating performance were much stronger than we anticipated. We ran our plants around the world at high levels during the period, but fell short of the inventory build we anticipated. Our operations are taking actions to optimize throughput and reach our desired service levels. Given present trends, the momentum of our residential businesses should remain strong, while the commercial channel should slowly improve from its trough. We will benefit from structural improvements in our costs and innovative new products that will enhance our mix. Most of the Covid restrictions around the world have not directly impacted the sales or installation of our products. Continued government subsidies and low interest rates should support economic recoveries, new home construction and residential remodeling. We are seeing increasing inflation in most of our product categories and are raising prices in response. Assuming current conditions continue, we anticipate our first quarter adjusted EPS to be $2.69 to $2.79, excluding restructuring charges.

“The strength of our organization was demonstrated by our management of last year’s historic decline in sales and the subsequent spike in demand while protecting our employees and customers. Our strategies and initiatives remain flexible to adapt to economic changes. With improving sales and cash flows and a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities.”

(a)During the second quarter of 2020, the Company revised the methodology it uses to estimate and allocate corporate general and administrative expenses to its operating segments to better align usage of corporate resources allocated to the Company segments. The updated allocation methodology had no impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. This change was applied retrospectively, and segment operating income for all comparative periods has been updated to reflect this change.

(1)In September 2019, the US commerce department imposed a 104% countervailing duty on top of the 25% general tariffs on all ceramic produced in China. As a consequence, ceramic purchases from China would dramatically decline and Mohawk took a $60 million write off to our investment in a Chinese manufacturer and distributor.

(2)In 2019, the Company implemented select operational, administrative and financial restructurings that centralized certain business processes and intangible assets in various European jurisdictions into a new entity. The restructurings resulted in a current tax liability of $136 million, calculated by measuring the fair value of intangible assets transferred. The Company offset the tax liability with the utilization of $136 million of deferred tax assets from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards. The restructurings also resulted in the Company recording a $136 million deferred tax asset, and a corresponding deferred tax benefit, related to the tax basis of the intangible assets transferred.

As required by the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the tables above present a reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measure. Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to the comparable US GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures, when reconciled to the corresponding US GAAP measure, help its investors as follows: Non-GAAP revenue measures that assist in identifying growth trends and in comparisons of revenue with prior and future periods and non-GAAP profitability measures that assist in understanding the long-term profitability trends of the Company's business and in comparisons of its profits with prior and future periods.

The Company excludes certain items from its non-GAAP revenue measures because these items can vary dramatically between periods and can obscure underlying business trends. Items excluded from the Company’s non-GAAP revenue measures include: foreign currency transactions and translation and the impact of acquisitions.

The Company excludes certain items from its non-GAAP profitability measures because these items may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the Company’s core operating performance. Items excluded from the Company’s non-GAAP profitability measures include: restructuring, acquisition and integration-related and other costs, acquisition purchase accounting, including inventory step-up, release of indemnification assets and the reversal of uncertain tax positions.
