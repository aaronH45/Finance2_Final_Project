Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

As previously announced, Marc N. Casper, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the “Company”), will present virtually today at the 39th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Among other topics, Mr. Casper will provide the Company’s current perspective on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and an update on expected revenue growth. Based on currently available information, the Company now expects fourth quarter reported and organic revenue1 growth of approximately 50%, compared to the expected fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 40% that the Company provided on December 1, 2020, when Mr. Casper participated in a virtual fireside chat at the Evercore ISI HealthCONx Conference. This would translate to full year 2020 reported and organic revenue growth of approximately 25%, compared to the expected full year 2020 organic revenue growth of approximately 22% that the Company also provided on December 1, 2020. Details will be provided on the Company’s earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 on February 1, 2021.

The information contained in Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Current Report on Form 8-K and today’s presentation contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including statements about fourth quarter revenue and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are set forth in the Company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available in the “Investors” section of its Website under the heading “SEC Filings.” Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the need to develop new products and adapt to significant technological change; implementation of strategies for improving growth; general economic conditions and related uncertainties; dependence on customers' capital spending policies and government funding policies; the effect of economic and political conditions and exchange rate fluctuations on international operations; use and protection of intellectual property; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; and the effect of laws and regulations governing government contracts, as well as the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions may not materialize as expected. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change and, therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

1 Organic revenue is reported revenue excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation. We are unable to reconcile organic revenue to reported revenue because the timing and amount of these items are uncertain and could be material to Thermo Fisher’s reported results.
