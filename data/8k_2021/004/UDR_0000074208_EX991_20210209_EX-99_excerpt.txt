“2020 proved to be a challenging but also gratifying year for UDR. Despite the economic realities brought on by the pandemic, our business and operating results have remained resilient due to ongoing advancements from our Next Generation Operating Platform, our diversified portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and the phenomenal dedication from all UDR associates,” said Tom Toomey, UDR’s Chairman and CEO. “2021 has started with signs of stability, including occupancy above 96 percent, higher levels of traffic, and concessions starting to ease. However, increased and extended regulatory actions, the timing and efficacy of widespread vaccinations, and the unknown cadence of the full reopening of the nation’s economy continue to pose risks to our business. Nevertheless, UDR has a strong team with a proven ability to execute our strategy, and the Company is well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities as demonstrated by our accretive capital recycling efforts. I commend our associates for their engagement and the compassion they have demonstrated with our residents during 2020 and look forward to a successful 2021.”

Recent Operating Trends

The table below is a summary of third quarter 2020, fourth quarter 2020, and January 2021 residential operational trends. “I am encouraged by our January results, which continue to demonstrate stable billed revenue, increasing occupancy, and improving effective blended lease rate growth,” said Mike Lacy, UDR’s Senior Vice President of Operations. “Despite a slight seasonal deterioration in collections, which has historically occurred every year during the months of November, December, and January, we remain confident in our ability to collect residential rent payments in the high-90 percent range of billed revenue.”

Additional assumptions for the Company’s first quarter and 2021 outlook can be found on Attachment 15 of the Company’s related quarterly Supplemental Financial Information. A reconciliation of FFO per share, FFOA per share, and AFFO per share to GAAP Net Income per share can be found on Attachment 16(E) of the Company’s related quarterly Supplemental Financial Information.

​

Fourth Quarter 2020 Operations

In the fourth quarter, total revenue decreased by ($2.4) million year-over-year, or (0.8) percent, to $302.4 million. This decrease was primarily attributable to declines in revenue from mature communities. The fourth quarter annualized rate of turnover increased by 120 basis points versus the prior year period to 41.1 percent. Please refer to the table on page 1 of this Press Release for additional details on fourth quarter Combined Same-Store growth results.

24.6 percent of the Company’s fourth quarter 2020 Combined Same-Store NOI came from communities located in New York, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Boston. YOY rent growth and occupancy in the suburban areas of these markets remained stable during the fourth quarter, but operating results in the urban areas of these markets remained challenged due to delayed re-openings of the cities, resulting in elevated concessionary activity and lower physical occupancy versus the prior year period.
