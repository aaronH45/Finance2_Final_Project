Outlook 

The Company stated that forecasting continues to be challenging given the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and ensuing impact to the global economic environment. Management cautions that market dynamics and impacts related to COVID-19 are fluid and changes to the business environment can happen quickly. The estimates include significant uncertainty and management acknowledges that market conditions are subject to change. 

Based on today's assessment of market conditions, management anticipates local currency sales growth in 2021 will be in the range of 5% to 7%, and Adjusted EPS is forecasted to be in the range of $29.20 to $29.80, an increase of 14% to 16%. This compares with previous guidance of Adjusted EPS in the range of $27.50 to $28.30.

For the first quarter of 2021, based on current market conditions, the Company anticipates that local currency sales growth will be in the range of 11% to 13% and Adjusted EPS is forecasted to be $5.55 to $5.70, a growth rate of 39% to 43%. 

While the Company has provided an outlook for local currency sales growth and Adjusted EPS, it has not provided an outlook for reported sales growth or EPS as it would require an estimate of currency exchange fluctuations and non-recurring items, which are not yet known. 

Conclusion

Filliol concluded, "In 2020, we strengthened our franchise with our ability to support our customers, while prioritizing on the safety of our employees and customers. We differentiated from competition by leveraging and quickly adjusting our digital sales and marketing and Go-to-Market approaches to identify and pursue pockets of growth and effectively engage with customers. Our agility in responding to the unprecedented market conditions led to further share gains that would not have been possible without our Spinnaker sales and marketing foundation, excellent product portfolio, world-class service organization and strong culture of execution. We are in a strong position to capitalize on growth as customer demand improves throughout the world. While uncertainty remains surrounding the ultimate impact to the economy from COVID-19, we will continue to focus on serving our customers and driving our growth and margin initiatives. We will remain agile and adapt to changes in market conditions as necessary. We have good momentum as we enter 2021 and believe we are well positioned to continue to gain share and deliver strong results."
