EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY 

“In 2020, Zoetis delivered another year of strong growth and market leadership thanks to our diverse and durable portfolio, our commitment to continuous innovation and the essential nature of our business,” said Kristin Peck, Chief Executive Officer of Zoetis. “We grew revenue 9% operationally, which is once again above market growth in a competitive, global sector. We also grew our adjusted net income faster than revenue, at 10% operationally."

"Looking forward, we believe this momentum sets us up for a strong 2021, even amidst ongoing COVID-19 uncertainty. We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in 2021 driven by continued strength in petcare; ongoing expansion in markets outside the U.S., most notably China; and acceleration of our diagnostics portfolio penetration. As a result, we are guiding to full-year operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue," said Peck.

QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS 

Zoetis organizes and manages its commercial operations across two regional segments: the United States (U.S.) and International. Within these segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for companion animals and livestock tailored to local trends and customer needs. In the fourth quarter of 2020: 

•Revenue in the U.S. segment was $952 million, an increase of 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Sales of companion animal products increased 30% driven primarily by growth in Simparica Trio®, the recently launched triple combination parasiticide for dogs, as well as the company’s key dermatology portfolio across both the Apoquel® and Cytopoint® brands. The diagnostic portfolio also contributed to growth based on the continued recovery of veterinary clinic business following the impact of social distancing restrictions earlier in the year and the acquisition of a number of regional diagnostic

reference labs in late 2019. Sales of livestock products decreased 15% in the quarter. Sales of cattle products declined as a result of an earlier fall cattle run than the same period in the prior year, supply constraints on vaccines and generic competition. Sales of both swine and poultry products also declined in the quarter due to unfavorable market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

•Revenue in the International segment was $832 million, an increase of 5% on a reported basis and an increase of 7% operationally compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Sales of companion animal products grew 17% on a reported and operational basis. Growth resulted from increased sales across the broader in-line portfolio and with key accounts. Also contributing to growth in the quarter was the Simparica® franchise, including Simparica Trio, which was recently launched in Australia, the European Union (EU) and Canada, as well as the company’s key dermatology portfolio across both the Apoquel and Cytopoint brands. Sales of livestock products decreased 2% on a reported basis and increased 2% operationally. Sales of swine products grew in China as a result of expanding herd production in key accounts and increased biosecurity measures in the wake of African Swine Fever. In other key global swine markets, vaccine sales increased as a result of favorable market conditions including increased production and export opportunities. Growth in the company’s fish portfolio was driven primarily by increased market share for salmon vaccines and the acquisition of Fish Vet Group. The company’s cattle portfolio remained flat, while poultry product sales decreased versus the same period due to rotation programs and COVID-19 restrictions.

INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH

Zoetis continues to pave the way in the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies to treat osteoarthritis (OA) pain in dogs and cats. Since its last quarterly earnings announcement, the company received approval in the EU, Brazil, Canada and Switzerland for Librela® (bedinvetmab), the first injectable mAb licensed for alleviation of pain associated with OA in dogs. Similarly, Zoetis received approval in Switzerland for Solensia® (frunevetmab), the first injectable mAb for the treatment of pain associated with OA in cats, a condition that is vastly underdiagnosed and treated in felines today.

In other companion animal product advancements, the company gained approval in the EU for an extended claim for Cytopoint (lokivetmab), an injectable monoclonal antibody therapy for dogs. The new claim, which is already approved in the U.S., includes the treatment of pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis, in addition to the original claim of clinical manifestations of atopic dermatitis. Zoetis also expanded the geographic reach of key parasiticide products, with approvals of Simparica Trio (sarolaner, moxidectin, pyrantel chewable tablets) for dogs in Latin America and Revolution Plus® (selamectin and sarolaner topical solution) for cats in Asia. 

In livestock, Zoetis received approval in the EU for CircoMax® Myco (also known as Fostera® Gold PCV MH outside of the EU), a one-shot vaccine for pigs that offers the longest lasting combined protection on the EU market against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections. In poultry, the company expanded its line of recombinant vector vaccines with the approval

of Poulvac® Procerta™ HVT-IBD in the U.S., which provides early protection against the contemporary infectious bursal disease (IBD) viruses in chickens.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Zoetis expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A further list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, including in the sections thereof captioned “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results” and “Item 1A.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and operational results (which exclude the impact of foreign exchange), to assess and analyze our results and trends and to make financial and operational decisions.

The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release should not be considered alternatives to measurements required by GAAP, such as net income, operating income, and earnings per share, and should not be considered measures of liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release and are posted on our website at www.zoetis.com.

2021 GUIDANCE 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January 2021.

Reconciliations of 2021 reported guidance to 2021 adjusted guidance follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Operational growth (a non-GAAP financial measure) excludes the impact of foreign exchange.

(b) Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. GAAP net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted R&D expenses, and adjusted interest expense and other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. 

(c) We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted net income operational growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP reported financial measure because we are unable to calculate with reasonable certainty the foreign exchange impact of unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, potential future asset impairments and other certain significant items, without unreasonable effort. The foreign exchange impacts of these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period. 

(d) Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to acquisitions and other charges.
