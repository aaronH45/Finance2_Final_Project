ALLIANT ENERGY ANNOUNCES 2020 RESULTS

MADISON, Wis. - February 18, 2021 - Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: LNT) today announced U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP consolidated unaudited earnings per share (EPS) for 2020 and 2019 as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“Despite the events of an unprecedented year, we once again delivered strong earnings growth through solid execution of our purpose-driven strategy. In 2020, we completed our historic wind expansion and announced plans to invest in over 1,400 megawatts of solar, continuing to be one of the industry leaders in the advancement of renewable energy,” said John Larsen, Alliant Energy Chairman, President and CEO. “Consistent with our 5 to 7% long-term earnings growth goal, our 2020 temperature normalized non-GAAP earnings per share increased 7% over calendar year 2019.”

Utilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy’s Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $2.36 per share of GAAP EPS in 2020, which was $0.14 per share higher than 2019. The primary driver of higher EPS was higher earnings resulting from Interstate Power and Light Company’s (IPL’s) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company’s (WPL’s) increasing rate base. This item was partially offset by higher depreciation expense, lower allowance for funds used during construction, equity dilution, and higher WPL electric fuel-related costs, net of recoveries.

Earnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for 2020 excludes $0.02 per share related to credit loss adjustments on a guarantee for an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum Corporation (Whiting Petroleum) and $0.02 per share related to a tax valuation allowance adjustment, both for Alliant Energy’s Non-utility and Parent. Non-GAAP EPS for 2019 excludes earnings of $0.02 per share related to ATC return on equity (ROE) reserve adjustments due to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision in the fourth quarter of 2019 regarding Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. transmission owners’ authorized ROE. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.

Temperature Impacts to Non-GAAP EPS - The estimated net impacts of temperatures on retail electric and gas sales were $0.01 per share and $0.05 per share gains in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS was $2.42 per share and $2.26 per share for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Details regarding GAAP EPS variances between 2020 and 2019 for Alliant Energy are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Higher revenue requirements primarily due to increasing rate base - In March 2019, IPL filed a request with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric and gas customers, based on a 2020 forward-looking test period. An interim retail electric rate increase was implemented effective April 2019. The IUB approved settlement agreements to increase retail gas and electric rates, which were implemented on January 10, 2020 and February 26, 2020, respectively. IPL recognized $0.40 per share increase due to higher revenue requirements from increasing rate base. Increasing rate base at IPL is primarily attributed to its new wind generation projects. These investments have also increased depreciation expense and reduced fuel costs.

In December 2018, WPL received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approving WPL’s proposed settlement for its retail electric and gas rate review covering the 2019/2020 Test Period. Under the settlement, WPL’s retail electric and gas base rates did not change from 2018 levels through the end of 2020. The retail electric revenue requirement increase, resulting from increasing investments in rate base, was offset by federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 benefits and lower fuel-related costs. WPL recognized a $0.22 per share increase in 2020 due to higher revenue requirements from increasing rate base. Increasing rate base at WPL is primarily attributed to its West Riverside expansion project. This investment has also increased depreciation expense and reduced fuel costs.

Net temperature impact of retail electric and gas sales - Alliant Energy’s retail electric and gas sales increased in 2020 and 2019 due to impacts of temperatures on customer demand.

WPL’s 2019 retail electric and gas rate orders included an earnings sharing mechanism whereby WPL must defer a portion of its earnings and return this amount to its retail electric and gas customers if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 10.25%. As a result, a portion of the higher margins recognized at WPL due to the temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales in 2019 is expected to be returned to customers in a future year.

A portion of Alliant Energy’s incentive pay is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales in 2019 was offset by higher incentive pay expense. Alliant Energy’s estimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales, net of the WPL earnings sharing mechanism and the portion of incentive pay associated with temperature impacts on earnings, was estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in earnings in 2019. In 2020, no adjustments were made to the temperature impact of electric and gas sales. 

Credit loss adjustment on guarantee for affiliate of Whiting Petroleum - A wholly-owned subsidiary of Alliant Energy continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under multiple general partnership agreements it maintains within the oil industry. The partnership obligations include costs associated with the future abandonment of certain facilities owned by the partnerships. Whiting Petroleum completed its bankruptcy proceedings in the third quarter of 2020. Alliant Energy estimates a decrease in the current expected credit loss related to the guarantees and has recognized $0.02 per share of earnings in 2020. 

Tax valuation allowance adjustment - In prior years, valuation allowances related to certain tax credit carryforwards were recorded, since it was expected they would expire before utilized. Based on updated taxable income projections, it was determined that a portion of these credits would be utilized before they expire. Alliant Energy recognized a $0.02 per share increase of earnings in 2020 as a result of reversing a portion of the valuation allowance.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy’s financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include the use of (1) income and EPS for year ended December 31, 2020 excluding credit loss adjustments on a guarantee for an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum and a tax valuation allowance adjustment; (2) income and EPS for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020 excluding a tax valuation allowance adjustment; and (3) income and EPS for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019 excluding the ATC ROE reserve adjustments. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy’s management also uses income, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation.

In addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL; Corporate Services; Utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Holdings; and Non-utility and Parent EPS for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.

This press release references year-over-year variances in utility electric margins and utility gas margins. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures that will be reported and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, in our 2020 Form 10-K.

This press release also includes temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because the measure facilitates period-to-period comparison of Alliant Energy’s operating performance and provides investors with information on a basis consistent with measures that management uses to assess Alliant Energy’s earnings growth rate.

The tax impact adjustments represent the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the estimated consolidated statutory tax rate.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings summaries that follow, and in the case of temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS, in the press release above.

Note: Unless otherwise noted, all “per share” references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.
