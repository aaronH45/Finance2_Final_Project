•Q3 Revenue of $7.8 Billion Increased 0.8% as Reported and Decreased 1.0% Organically

•Q3 GAAP Diluted EPS of $0.94; Q3 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS of $1.29

DUBLIN – Feb. 23, 2021 – Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2021, which ended January 29, 2021. 

The company reported third quarter worldwide revenue of $7.775 billion, an increase of 0.8 percent as reported and a decrease of 1.0 percent on an organic basis, which adjusts for the $136 million benefit of foreign currency translation. Unless otherwise stated, all revenue growth rates in this press release are stated on an organic basis, which adjusts for the impact of foreign currency translation. There were no acquisitions made in the last year that had a significant impact on the company’s or any individual segment’s third quarter revenue growth.

As reported, third quarter GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $1.270 billion and $0.94, respectively. As detailed in the financial schedules included through the link at the end of this release, third quarter non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS were $1.753 billion and $1.29, respectively, both decreases of 10 percent. Adjusting for the negative 6 cent impact from foreign currency, third quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased 6 percent.

Third quarter U.S. revenue of $3.939 billion represented 51 percent of company revenue and decreased 2 percent. Non-U.S. developed market revenue of $2.522 billion represented 32 percent of company revenue and increased 6 percent as reported and was flat organic. Emerging Markets revenue of $1.314 billion represented 17 percent of company revenue and was flat as reported and increased 1 percent organic.

“Our Q3 results reflect that our business is well on the way to returning to growth, with sequential improvements in both revenue and earnings, despite the impact of the COVID resurgence on procedure volumes in late December and January. We’re outperforming our end markets, as new products are driving share gains in an increasing number of our businesses,” said Geoff Martha, Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer. “Looking ahead, we’re positioning ourselves for long-term success as we implement our new operating model and execute on a number of large opportunities to win share and create and disrupt big markets.”

Cardiac and Vascular Group

The Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG) includes the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH), and Aortic, Peripheral & Venous (APV) divisions. CVG third quarter revenue of $2.707 billion decreased 4.0 percent as reported and 5.9 percent organic. CVG’s revenue reflected the impact of the COVID-19 resurgence on procedure volumes in the third quarter in late December and January. CVG’s organic performance reflected mid-single digit declines in CRHF, high-single digit declines in CSH, and mid-single digit declines in APV.

•Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure third quarter revenue of $1.371 billion decreased 1.6 percent as reported and decreased 3.7 percent organic. Arrhythmia Management revenue declined in the mid-single digits. This included mid-sixties growth globally and mid-seventies growth in the United States in Leadless Pacemakers, on the continued global adoption of the company’s Micra™ transcatheter pacing systems. Heart Failure declined low-single digits, as low-single digit declines in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemakers (CRT-Ps) 

2

and mid-twenties declines in Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) were partially offset by low-single digit growth in cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-Ds) from the recent launch of Cobalt™ and Crome™.

•Coronary & Structural Heart third quarter revenue of $873 million decreased 7.9 percent as reported and 9.5 percent organic, reflecting low-double digit declines in drug-eluting stents (DES). The company experienced a continued impact to DES sales in China as a result of the national tender announcement in mid-October. While transcatheter aortic valves (TAVR) declined mid-single digits versus the prior year, the company estimates it gained share sequentially.

•Aortic, Peripheral & Venous third quarter revenue of $463 million decreased 3.1 percent as reported and 5.0 percent organic. Aortic declined in the low-single digits, Peripheral declined in the mid-single digits, and Venous declined in the low-double digits. Sales of the company’s IN.PACT™ drug-coated balloons increased high-single digits.

Minimally Invasive Therapies Group

The Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG) includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions. MITG third quarter revenue of $2.313 billion increased 6.3 percent as reported and 4.6 percent organic. MITG’s revenue reflected the increased demand for COVID-19 related diagnostics and therapies, offset by the impact of the COVID-19 resurgence on procedure volumes in late December and January. RGR’s mid-twenties organic growth was partially offset by SI’s mid-single digit organic decline.

•Surgical Innovations third quarter revenue of $1.423 billion decreased 3.5 percent as reported and 5.3 percent organic. Advanced Surgical declined mid-single digits and General Surgery declined in the high-single digits, both reflecting the deceleration of worldwide surgical procedure recovery due to the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

3

•Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal third quarter revenue of $890 million increased 26.8 percent as reported and 25.4 organic. Respiratory Interventions increased mid-seventies organic, with sales of ventilators increasing nearly three-fold to meet global demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient Monitoring increased in the low-double digits on strength of the company’s Nellcor™ pulse oximetry products.

Restorative Therapies Group

The Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) includes the Cranial and Spinal Technologies, Specialty Therapies, and Neuromodulation divisions. RTG third quarter revenue of $2.126 billion increased 0.7 percent as reported and decreased 0.8 percent organic. RTG’s revenue reflected the impact of the COVID-19 resurgence on procedure volumes in the third quarter in late December and January, partially offset by growth from new products. RTG’s organic performance this quarter included mid-single-digit declines in Cranial and Spinal Technologies and low-single digit organic growth in Specialty Therapies and Neuromodulation.

•Cranial and Spinal Technologies third quarter revenue of $1.081 billion decreased 3.2 percent as reported and 4.5 percent organic, including mid-single digit declines in Spine and low-single digit declines in Enabling Technology.

•Specialty Therapies third quarter revenue of $618 million increased 5.1 percent as reported and 3.2 percent organic. Neurovascular increased in the mid-single digits and Pelvic Health increased in the mid-teens, partially offset by mid-single digit declines in ENT. 

•Neuromodulation third quarter revenue of $426 million increased 4.9 percent as reported and 3.4 percent organic, with new products driving low-single digit growth in Pain Therapies and mid-single digit growth in DBS.

Diabetes Group

Diabetes Group third quarter revenue of $630 million increased 3.3 percent as reported and 0.8 percent organic. Diabetes Group revenue performance reflected mid-single digit growth in durable pumps and CGM due to the launch of MiniMed™ 780G in international markets and the MiniMed™ 770G launch in the U.S.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This press release contains financial measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, and organic revenue, which are considered “non-GAAP” financial measures under applicable SEC rules and regulations. References to quarterly figures increasing, decreasing or remaining flat are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2020.

Medtronic management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the company’s underlying operational performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the med tech industry.

Medtronic generally uses non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management’s review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and investors are cautioned that Medtronic may calculate non-GAAP financial measures in a way that is different from other companies. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.
