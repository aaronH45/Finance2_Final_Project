•Full year revenues of $19.8 billion; GAAP1 Net Income of $1.8 billion

•EBITDA for the full year was 15.7 percent of sales; Diluted EPS of $12.01

COLUMBUS, IND. - Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) today reported results for the fourth quarter of 2020.

Fourth quarter revenues of $5.8 billion increased 5 percent from the same quarter in 2019. Sales in North America were flat while international revenues increased 12 percent driven by strong demand in China truck and construction markets as well as the growth in new product sales in India. 

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the fourth quarter were $837 million (14.4 percent of sales), compared to $682 million (12.2 percent of sales) excluding restructuring a year ago. Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million of expenses associated with reorganization activities and facility closures primarily driven by transformation initiatives in our Distribution segment.

Net income attributable to Cummins in the fourth quarter was $501 million ($3.36 per diluted share) compared to $390 million ($2.56 per diluted share) excluding restructuring in 2019. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 19.7 percent.

Revenues for the full year were $19.8 billion, 16 percent lower than 2019. Sales in North America declined 21 percent and international revenues declined 7 percent. Sales declined in all major regions except China, where demand for trucks and construction equipment reached record levels. 

“We faced many challenges in 2020 driven by the severe global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” said Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger. “I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication to our company and our customers as they adjusted to the unprecedented slowdown in the global economy and then responded as demand accelerated sharply in the second half of the year, all while facing significant disruption to their daily routines at work and home.” 

EBITDA for the year was $3.1 billion (15.7 percent of sales) compared to $3.7 billion (15.8 percent of sales) excluding restructuring in 2019.

Net income attributable to Cummins for the full year was $1.8 billion ($12.01 per diluted share), compared to net income of $2.4 billion ($15.05 per diluted share) excluding restructuring in 2019. The tax rate for 2020 was 22.5 percent. 

2021 Outlook:

Based on the current forecast, Cummins projects full year 2021 revenues to be up 8 to 12 percent, and EBITDA to be in the range of 15.0 and 15.5 percent of sales. We expect revenues to increase in all regions and major markets except China where we expect demand to moderate after a record year in 2020. 

“Current indicators point to improving demand in a number of key regions and markets in 2021. However, significant uncertainty remains, requiring continued strong focus on managing costs and cash flow as our markets continue to recover around the world. We are still operating under a pandemic with extreme safety measures in place and our suppliers and customers are doing the same. This is presenting challenges to global supply chains as our industry responds to rising demand across multiple end markets. Having effectively managed through an extremely challenging 2020, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders.” said Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger. 

The company plans to return 75 percent of Operating Cash Flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

2020 Highlights:

•The Company announced the creation of the Cummins Advocates for Racial Equity Group to focus on police reform, criminal justice, social justice, and economic empowerment of Black people in the United States.

•Cummins increased its cash dividend for the 11th straight year and returned a total of $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

•In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company used its filter technology to provide 146 tons of filtration media to mask manufacturers across the globe, which has been used to produce more than 108 million masks.

•The Company established a joint venture called NPROXX to provide hydrogen storage tank solutions to customers in multiple applications including rail, truck, bus, and other on-highway applications to advance the adoption of hydrogen-based technologies.

•In November of 2020, Cummins was named to the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for North America, one of the premier measures of corporate sustainability, for a 15th consecutive year.

•Cummins is one of 21 companies named a “Culture Champion” in October 2020 by a partnership between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Glassdoor, one of the world’s leading recruiting websites. The Company receives high marks for creating cultures of integrity and respect while ranking first in the study’s category for promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace culture.

INCOME TAXES

Our effective tax rate for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was 19.7 percent and 22.5 percent, respectively. 

The three months ended December 31, 2020, contained favorable discrete items of $1 million, or $0.01 per share, consisting of $9 million of favorable changes of provision to return adjustments relating to tax returns filed for 2019, almost offset by $8 million of unfavorable net other discrete items.

The twelve months ended December 31, 2020, contained $26 million, or $0.17 per share, of unfavorable net discrete tax items, primarily due to $33 million of unfavorable changes in tax reserves and $10 million of withholding tax adjustments, partially offset by $15 million of favorable changes due to the India Tax Law Change. The India Tax Law Change eliminated the dividend distribution tax and replaced it with a lower rate withholding tax as the burden shifted from the dividend payor to the dividend recipient for a net favorable income statement impact of $35 million.

The India Tax Law Change resulted in the following adjustments to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income in the year ended December 31, 2020:

FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP

(Unaudited)

Reconciliation of Non GAAP measures - Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and noncontrolling interests (EBITDA)

We believe EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors.

EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. It should be considered supplemental data; however, the amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are derived from amounts included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income. Below is a reconciliation of “Net income attributable to Cummins Inc.” to EBITDA for each of the applicable periods:
