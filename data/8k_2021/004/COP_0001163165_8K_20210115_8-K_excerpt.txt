 Item 2.01.Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. 

On January 15, 2021, ConocoPhillips, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), completed its previously announced acquisition of Concho Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Concho”), in connection with the merger of Falcon Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), with and into Concho (the “Merger”), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 18, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), among the Company, Merger Sub and Concho. At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock of Concho, par value $0.001 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding certain Excluded Shares and Converted Shares (each as defined in the Merger Agreement)) was converted into the right to receive 1.46 (the “Exchange Ratio”) shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “Merger Consideration”). 

At the Effective Time: (1) each outstanding award of restricted common stock of Concho (other than an award that fully vested by its terms at the Effective Time) was converted into an award in respect of a number of shares of restricted common stock of the Company equal to the product of the number of shares of common stock of Concho subject to the award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded to the nearest whole share; (2) each outstanding award of restricted common stock of Concho that fully vested by its terms at the Effective Time vested and was converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share subject to the award; (3) each outstanding award of performance units (other than any such award granted following the execution of the Merger Agreement) vested (applicable performance goals were deemed satisfied at 200% of target (which is two-thirds of maximum performance) for active employees and any former employee who, as of the Effective Time, serves on the Concho board, and based on actual performance for former employees) and was converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the value of the Merger Consideration in respect of each share subject to the award; and (4) each outstanding award of performance units granted following the execution of the Merger Agreement was converted into a time-vesting award in respect of a number of shares of restricted common stock of the Company equal to the product of the target number of shares of common stock of Concho subject to the award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded to the nearest whole share. 

The issuance of shares of common stock of the Company in connection with the Merger was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-250183), declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 10, 2020.
