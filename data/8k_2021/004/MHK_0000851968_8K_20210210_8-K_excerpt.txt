Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

The information in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed “filed” for purpose of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

On February 11, 2021, Mohawk Industries, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release to report the Company’s earnings for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2020, which is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On February 10, 2021, the Company announced the appointment of James F. Brunk as Chief Financial Officer, effective April 1, 2021. 

“I have worked with Jim for many years, and I am confident that he will do an excellent job as our chief financial officer,” said Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk’s chairman and chief executive officer. “He has a deep understanding of our global operations and will positively influence our performance. His expertise in financial planning and analysis, mergers and acquisitions, accounting and investor relations has been exhibited throughout his three-decade career.”

Since May 2009, Brunk, 55, has served as Mohawk’s corporate controller and chief accounting officer. He joined the Company in 2006 as chief financial officer of the Mohawk Home division. Before becoming part of the Company, Brunk held finance and operations roles of progressively greater responsibility with major manufacturing companies.

“I’m honored to take on the CFO position at Mohawk, where I’ve had the opportunity to grow personally and professionally over the past fifteen years,” said Brunk. “I’ve had the privilege to partner with a finance team comprised of talented experts in many disciplines, focused both on protecting and delivering results for the business. I look forward to leading our finance team and partnering with our management team and board of directors as we identify new initiatives to strengthen the Company.”

Since returning to Mohawk as chief financial officer in April 2020, Frank H. Boykin has worked closely with Brunk to ensure a smooth transition and will retire as planned in April this year. Boykin previously served as Mohawk’s chief financial officer from January 2005.

In connection with Brunk’s appointment, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved an annualized base salary of $575,000 and participation in the Company’s annual cash bonus and equity incentive plans on similar terms as our other senior executives, and a time-vesting equity award of equal to $500,000 of restricted stock units. The retention equity award will vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment.

Effective April 1, 2021, Steven H. Lee (age 50) has been promoted to the position of Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Controller of the Company, succeeding Brunk in such positions. Lee joined the Company in July 2012 as Senior Director, Assistant Corporate Controller, then served as Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer of the Company’s European Ceramic business from July 2015 to September 2018 and has served as Vice President – Assistant Controller since September 2018.
