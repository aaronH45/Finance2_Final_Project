“We closed out 2020 on a high note and our results for the year demonstrate the power of Masco’s differentiated portfolio of leading repair and remodel brands, strong cash generation capabilities, and most of all, the commitment of our people,” said Allman. “In an ever-changing environment, our employees continued to meet the needs of our customers and deliver value for our shareholders. Thanks to their dedicated efforts, we surpassed our previously guided expectation of achieving $2.80 – $3.00 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021, a full year earlier than planned.”

“We anticipate the demand for our products will remain strong in 2021,” said Allman. “The key housing fundamentals that drive our business, such as home price appreciation and existing home turnover, improved during the second half of 2020, and consumers are clearly viewing the value of their homes more favorably in light of the pandemic. Given these dynamics, we anticipate 2021 adjusted earnings per share to range from $3.25 to $3.45 per share.”

Dividend and Share Repurchase Authorization

Masco’s Board of Directors announced its intention to increase the Company’s annual dividend to $0.94 per share from $0.56 per share, a 68 percent increase, beginning in the second quarter of 2021. 

The Board also approved a new $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization effective February 10, 2021, replacing the existing authorization. 

“The anticipated dividend increase we’ve announced today, along with the new $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization, underscores our strong financial position and the Board’s confidence in our future,” concluded Allman.
