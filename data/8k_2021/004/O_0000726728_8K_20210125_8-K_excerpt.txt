In addition, the Committee approved, effective as of the Appointment Date, a restricted stock grant under the Company’s 2012 Incentive Award Plan with a value of $100,000, 25% of which will vest on each of the four anniversaries of the grant date, subject to Ms. Bushore’s continued employment with the Company on the applicable vesting dates.

On January 25, 2021, in connection with Ms. Bushore’s appointment as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Counsel, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, the Committee designated Ms. Bushore as a participant in the Severance Plan, effective as of the Appointment Date, and Ms. Bushore and the Company entered into a participation agreement under the Severance Plan (the “Participation Agreement”), which will be effective upon the Appointment Date, in each case subject to the commencement of Ms. Bushore’s employment as Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company. Pursuant to the Severance Plan and the Participation Agreement, following the commencement of Ms. Bushore’s employment as Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, if Ms. Bushore’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without “cause” or by Ms. Bushore due to a “constructive termination” (each as defined in the Severance Plan), then, subject to her execution and non-revocation of a severance agreement and general release of claims, Ms. Bushore will be entitled to receive:

•a lump-sum cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (x) one (or, in the event of a termination within 12 months following a change in control of the Company, two), and (y) the sum of (i) Ms. Bushore’s then-current annual base salary, plus (ii) the average annual cash bonus earned by Ms. Bushore for the previous three years (or, if Ms. Bushore was not previously eligible to earn an annual cash bonus, her target annual cash bonus);

•continued group health insurance coverage at the Company’s expense during the 12 month period (or, in the event of a termination within 12 months following a change in control of the Company, the 18 month period) following Ms. Bushore’s termination date or until Ms. Bushore becomes covered under another group health insurance plan, whichever occurs first; and

•each outstanding and unvested time-vesting restricted stock and restricted stock unit award held by Ms. Bushore will vest in full as of her termination date, and each outstanding and unvested performance-vesting equity award held by Ms. Bushore will be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan and award agreement governing such award. 

If Ms. Bushore’s employment with the Company is terminated by reason of her death or disability, then, each outstanding and unvested time-vesting restricted stock and restricted stock unit award held by Ms. Bushore will fully vest as of such termination date.

Ms. Bushore’s right to receive and retain the severance benefits payable under the Severance Plan is conditioned on her continued compliance with any restrictive covenants with respect to which she is bound and her timely return of all Company property in her possession following her termination date. The Participation Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that will apply to Ms. Bushore, including a confidentiality covenant that extends indefinitely.

The foregoing descriptions of the Severance Plan and the Participation Agreement are not complete and are subject to and qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Severance Plan and Form of Participation Agreement previously filed as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on January 18, 2019, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
