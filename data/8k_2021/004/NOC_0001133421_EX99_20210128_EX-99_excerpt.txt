MTM-adjusted Net Earnings and EPS

Net earnings for both the fourth quarter and 2020 were reduced by a $774 million after-tax MTM expense. Excluding this expense, fourth quarter 2020 MTM-adjusted net earnings1 increased 16 percent and 2020 MTM-adjusted net earnings1 increased 10 percent. MTM-adjusted earnings1 and EPS1 are the measures the company uses to compare performance to prior periods and for EPS guidance.

The table below reconciles net earnings and diluted EPS to MTM-adjusted net earnings1 and MTM-adjusted diluted EPS1:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Non-GAAP measure — see definitions at the end of this earnings release.

2 

MTM expense is expected to be deductible on our future state tax returns. The deferred state benefit was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 5.25 percent in 2020 and 4.50 percent in 2019 and included in Unallocated corporate expense within operating income. 

3 MTM expense is expected to be deductible on our future federal tax returns. The federal tax benefit in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax benefit from MTM expense and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate.

4 Fourth quarter 2019 diluted EPS excludes the dilutive effect of awards granted to employees under stock-based compensation plans as such awards would be antidilutive. 2019 MTM-adjusted diluted EPS is calculated using weighted-average diluted shares outstanding of 169.3 million.

Sales

Fourth quarter 2020 sales increased $1.5 billion, or 17 percent, and 2020 sales increased $3.0 billion, or 9 percent, due to higher sales at all four sectors and includes a $444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer at Aeronautics Systems.

Operating Income and Margin Rate 

Fourth quarter 2020 operating income increased $16 million, or 1 percent, primarily due to an increase in segment operating income, partially offset by higher unallocated corporate expense and a lower net FAS (service)/ CAS pension adjustment. Operating margin rate declined to 11.3 percent from 13.0 percent, principally due to a lower segment operating margin rate, higher unallocated corporate expense and lower net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment. 

2020 operating income increased $96 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to an increase in segment operating income, partially offset by higher unallocated corporate expense and a lower net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment. 2020 operating margin rate declined to 11.0 percent from 11.7 percent principally due to a lower segment operating margin rate, higher unallocated corporate expense and lower net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment.

Segment Operating Income and Margin Rate

Fourth quarter 2020 segment operating income1 increased $89 million, or 8 percent, principally due to higher operating income at Space Systems, Defense Systems and Aeronautics Systems. Segment operating margin rate1 decreased to 11.2 percent from 12.1 percent principally due to lower operating margin rates at Mission Systems, Aeronautics Systems and Space Systems, partially offset by a higher operating margin rate at Defense Systems.

2020 segment operating income1 increased $210 million, or 5 percent, and reflects higher operating income at all four sectors. Segment operating margin rate1 decreased to 11.4 percent from 11.8 percent principally due to a lower operating margin rate at Aeronautics Systems.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, certain unallowable compensation and other costs previously included in segment operating results are now reported in Unallocated corporate expense within operating income as the company no longer considers these costs as part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance. This change, which had no impact on total operating income, increased fourth quarter and full year 2020 segment operating income by $23 million and $48 million, respectively, and has been applied retrospectively. Recast results are presented in Schedule 7.

Federal and Foreign Income Taxes

The fourth quarter 2020 effective tax rate decreased to (8.2) percent from 28.1 percent in the prior year period. MTM expense reduced the fourth quarter 2020 effective tax rate by 22.3 percentage points and increased the fourth quarter 2019 effective tax rate by 10.7 percentage points.

The 2020 effective tax rate increased to 14.5 percent from 11.8 percent in 2019. MTM expense reduced the 2020 effective tax rate by 1.3 percentage points and the 2019 effective tax rate by 3.7 percentage points.

Guidance

 Financial guidance, as well as outlook, trends, expectations and other forward looking statements provided by the company for 2021 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on the information available to the company at the time of this release. The company’s 2021 financial guidance and outlook beyond 2021 reflect what the company currently anticipates will be the impacts on the company from the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, based on what the company understands today and what the company has experienced to date. However, the company cannot predict how the pandemic will evolve or what impact it will continue to have, and there can be no assurance that the company’s underlying assumptions are correct. As discussed more fully in the company’s Form 10-K, and among other factors, disruptions to the company’s operations (or those of its customers or supply chain), additional costs and liabilities, disruptions in the market, and impacts on programs or payments relating to the global COVID-19 pandemic, today and as it may evolve, can be expected to affect the company’s ability to achieve guidance or meet expectations. In addition, the government budget, appropriations and procurement priorities and processes can impact our customers, programs and financial results. These priorities and processes, including the timing of appropriations and the occurrence of an extended continuing resolution and/or prolonged government shutdown, as well as a breach of the debt ceiling, or changes in support for our programs or in federal corporate tax rates, can impact the company's ability to achieve guidance or meet expectations.

On Dec. 7, 2020, Northrop Grumman announced that it had reached a definitive agreement with Peraton Inc., a Veritas company, for the sale of the company’s IT and mission support services business, for approximately $3.4 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The transaction is expected to close very soon, subject to government approvals and customary closing conditions. In 2020, this business generated $2.3 billion in revenue, $1.6 billion of which is in the Defense Systems sector, $0.5 billion of which is in the Mission Systems sector and the remaining $0.2 billion in the Space Systems sector. The company expects to use the sale proceeds primarily to fund share repurchases, to offset dilution from the transaction, and for debt retirement. The company's 2021 financial guidance contemplates completion of the transaction very soon, excluding gain on sale, transaction costs and make-whole provisions.

Northrop Grumman Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Financial Results21

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Disclosure: This earnings release contains non-GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) financial measures, as defined by SEC Regulation G and indicated by a footnote in the text of the release. Definitions for the non-GAAP measures are provided below and reconciliations are provided in the body of the release, except that reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP measures are not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and financial impact of certain items, including, but not limited to, the impact of any mark-to-market pension adjustment. Other companies may define these measures differently or may utilize different non-GAAP measures.

MTM-adjusted net earnings: Net earnings excluding MTM expense and related tax impacts. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. This measure is also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of MTM accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. MTM-adjusted net earnings is reconciled in the “MTM-adjusted Earnings and EPS” table within the body of this release.

MTM-adjusted diluted EPS: Diluted earnings per share excluding the per share impact of MTM expense and related tax impacts. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance per share by presenting the company’s diluted earnings per share results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. MTM-adjusted diluted EPS is reconciled in the “MTM-adjusted Earnings and EPS” table within the body of this release.

Segment operating income and segment operating margin rate: Segment operating income, as reconciled in the “Consolidated Operating Results” table within the body of this release, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) reflect total earnings from our four segments, including allocated pension expense we have recognized under CAS, and excluding unallocated corporate items and FAS pension expense. These measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP. 

Cash provided by operating activities before after-tax discretionary pension contributions: Cash provided by operating activities before the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Cash provided by operating activities before after-tax discretionary pension contributions has been provided for consistency and comparability of financial performance and is reconciled in the "Cash Flows" table within the body of this release.

Adjusted free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from sale of equipment to a customer (not otherwise included in net cash provided by operating activities) and the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction. It also includes the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance. This measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and share repurchases. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative
