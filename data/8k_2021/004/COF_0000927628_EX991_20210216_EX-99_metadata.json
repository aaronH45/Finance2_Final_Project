        "(5)Includes the impact of COVID-19 customer assistance programs. For domestic card customers enrolled in short-term payment deferrals, delinquency status is generally frozen at the time of enrollment and upon exiting the program, resumes to the status at the time of enrollment. For auto customers enrolled in short-term payment extensions, the contractual term of the loan is extended by the length of the short-term payment extension and the delinquency status is updated to reflect the revised terms of the loan. For auto customers that were delinquent at the time of enrollment, their delinquency status is reduced commensurate with the length of the short-term payment extensions."
