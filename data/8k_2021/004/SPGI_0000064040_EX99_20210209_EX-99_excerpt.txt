New York, NY, February 9, 2021 – S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) today reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results. The Company reported fourth quarter 2020 revenue of $1.87 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2019 with growth in all four businesses. 

Fourth quarter net income decreased 16% to $454 million and diluted earnings per share decreased 15% to $1.88 as the Company took a number of lease impairment and restructuring charges aimed at improving future financial performance. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $654 million due to revenue growth, productivity improvements, and a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased investment spending. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $2.71 benefiting from a 2% decrease in the average diluted shares outstanding. Pre-tax adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $247 million primarily due to office lease and equipment impairments, and restructuring charges all intended to improve future financial performance. Additional pre-tax adjustments included IHS Markit merger costs, deal-related amortization, and Kensho retention-related expenses. 

For the full year, revenue increased 11% to $7.44 billion. 2020 net income increased 10% to $2.34 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $9.66. 2020 adjusted net income increased 20% to $2.83 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $11.69.

“The markets turned to our essential intelligence more than ever, during a very tumultuous 2020, as we experienced a significant increase in demand for our benchmarks, data, ratings, and research. Our indices helped inform investors as they navigated complex equity markets. Our ratings helped fixed income investors understand rapidly changing credit quality. Platts benchmarks informed commodity markets regarding drastic changes in oil and LNG prices. S&P Global Market Intelligence provided unique data to help customers quickly understand company-specific and market changes,” said Douglas L. Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer of S&P Global. He added, “These very strong financial results in 2020 are a testament to the caliber of our employees who persevered throughout the pandemic to meet, and exceed, the demands of our customers. During 2020 we also showcased our technology expertise with innovative new products like Marketplace, Kensho Scribe, Kensho Link, ProSpread™, RiskGauge, Platts high-speed Market-on-Close, and the S&P Kensho Moonshot Index. With a solid base business and the continued launch of new products I am very encouraged about the future of S&P Global, and the pending merger with IHS Markit will create an even better future.” 

IHS Markit Merger Update:  The Company's Form S-4 became effective January 22, 2021. Both companies have established a record date of January 19, 2021 for the respective shareholder votes which will take place on March 11, 2021. The Company is also seeking regulatory approval in several countries and that process is underway. 

Profit Margin: For the full year, the Company’s operating profit margin improved by 40 basis points to 48.6% as revenue gains and productivity improvements were partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt, impairments, and restructurings. The adjusted operating profit margin improved by 310 basis points to 53.3% in 2020.

Return of Capital: The Company returned $1.8 billion to shareholders in 2020 with $1.2 billion in share repurchases and $645 million in dividends. Share repurchases drove a 2% reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding during 2020. 

Dividend: On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of S&P Global approved a 15% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s common stock. The quarterly dividend will increase from $0.67 to $0.77 per share. The next dividend is payable on March 10, 2021, to shareholders of record on February 24, 2021. The new annualized dividend rate is $3.08 per share and has increased at an average compound annual growth rate of 10.2% since 1974. The Company has paid a dividend each year since 1937 and is one of fewer than 25 companies in the S&P 500 that has increased its dividend annually for at least the last 48 years.

S&P Dow Jones Indices:

S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC is a majority-owned subsidiary. The consolidated results are included in S&P Global’s income statement and the portion related to the 27% noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 

Industry inflows into exchange-traded funds reached $726 billion in 2020 with approximately half going into equities and the remaining going into fixed income and commodity/other ETFs. During 2020, $83 billion of inflows went into ETFs associated with our indices. Year-end 2020 ETF AUM based on our indices increased 18% from year-end 2019 to $2.0 trillion as a result of both price appreciation and fund inflows. Market volatility was higher in 2020 than 2019 resulting in increased revenue associated with exchange-traded derivatives. 

Page 2

4th Quarter, 2020: Revenue increased 10% to $257 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Revenue improved primarily due to increased asset-linked fees.

Operating profit increased 3% to $163 million. Operating profit margin decreased 400 basis points to 63.4% primarily due to restructuring expense and lease impairments.

Ratings: 

4th Quarter, 2020: Revenue increased 7% to $881 million. Organic revenue grew 5%. Non-transaction revenue increased 15% to $451 million during the quarter due to increased activity associated with surveillance, frequent issuer programs, Rating Evaluation Service, and new entity ratings as well as revenue from the acquisitions of Greenwich Associates by CRISIL and the ESG Ratings Business from RobecoSAM. Transaction revenue was relatively unchanged at $430 million in the fourth quarter as increases in bank loan ratings revenue were offset by a decrease in bond issuance compared to a very strong fourth quarter in 2019. 

Operating profit decreased 3% to $465 million and operating profit margin decreased 550 basis points to 52.8% in the quarter primarily due to restructuring expense, technology related impairments, and increased incentive compensation.

2020: Revenue increased 16% to $3.61 billion and organic revenue increased 15% primarily due to increased global corporate bond issuance offset partially by lower structured finance bond issuance and bank loan rating revenue.

improved 420 basis points to 61.6%. Adjusted operating profit increased 25% to $2.25 billion compared to 2019 and adjusted operating profit margin improved 460 basis points to 62.4%. 

Platts:

4th Quarter, 2020: Reported revenue increased 5% to $223 million with growth in the core subscription business partially offset by decreased Global Trading Services activity. Operating profit decreased 9% to $100 million and operating profit margin decreased 680 basis points to 44.8% primarily due to restructuring expense.

Corporate Unallocated Expense:

4th Quarter, 2020:  This expense increased by 209% to $192 million primarily due to lease impairments and restructuring expense. Adjusted Corporate Unallocated expense decreased by 21% to $35 million due to lower professional fees, a reduction in the Company's real estate footprint, and the timing of charitable contributions.

2020: This expense increased by 50% to $319 million primarily due to lease impairments and restructuring charges. Adjusted Corporate Unallocated expense decreased by 12% to $128 million primarily due to a reduction in the Company's real estate footprint, lower professional fees, and lower T&E expenses.

Provision for Income Taxes: The Company’s effective tax rates in 2020 and 2019 were relatively unchanged at 21.5% and 21.4%, respectively. The adjusted effective tax rates in 2020 and 2019 were also relatively unchanged at 21.5% and 21.7%, respectively.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow: Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2020 were $4.1 billion. For full-year 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion. Free cash flow was $3.3 billion, an increase of $779 million from 2019. Free cash flow, excluding tax audit settlements, tax on gains from divestitures, and the after-tax payments associated with legal settlements, was $3.3 billion, an increase of $714 million over 2019. 

Outlook:  The Company is not providing 2021 GAAP guidance because given the inherent uncertainty around the merger, management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of GAAP measures. The Company is providing adjusted guidance on a stand-alone basis that excludes anticipated merger expenses, the potential revenue and expense impact from consolidating IHS Markit following the merger, and amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions. 2021 reported revenue is expected to increase mid single-digits. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.25 to $12.45. Free cash flow excluding certain items is expected to be in a range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion.

Comparison of Adjusted Information to U.S. GAAP Information: The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company also refers to and presents certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted net income, adjusted operating profit and margin, organic revenue, adjusted Corporate Unallocated, adjusted effective tax rates, adjusted diluted EPS guidance, free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items. The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP on Exhibits 5 and 7. Reconciliations of certain forward looking non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are not available due to the challenges and impracticability with estimating some of the items. The Company is not able to provide reconciliations of such forward looking non-GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Because of those challenges, reconciliations of such forward looking non-GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.

The Company’s non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that, in the case of non-GAAP financial measures other than free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items, enables investors to better compare the Company’s performance across periods, and management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its business, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management and that such measures are useful in evaluating the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and repurchase stock. However, investors should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports.
