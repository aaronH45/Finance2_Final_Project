OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION AND BASIS FOR PRESENTATION

The Company defines its operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the operating segments based on the Company's management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee.

In fourth quarter 2020, Wells Fargo & Company (“the Company”) reorganized its management reporting into four reportable operating segments: 

•Consumer Banking and Lending which offers diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses with annual sales generally up to $5 million. These financial products and services include checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards, as well as home, auto, personal, and small business lending.

•Commercial Banking which provides financial solutions to private, family owned and certain public companies. Products and services include banking and credit products across multiple industry sectors and municipalities, secured lending and lease products, and treasury management.

•Corporate and Investment Banking which delivers a suite of capital markets, banking and financial products and services to corporate, commercial real estate, government and institutional clients globally. Products and services include corporate banking, investment banking, treasury management, commercial real estate lending and servicing, equity and fixed income solutions, as well as sales, trading, and research capabilities.

•Wealth and Investment Management which provides personalized wealth management, investment and retirement products and services to clients across U.S.-based businesses including Wells Fargo Advisors, The Private Bank, Abbot Downing, and Wells Fargo Asset Management. We serve clients’ brokerage needs, and deliver financial planning, private banking, credit and fiduciary services to high-net worth and ultra-high-net worth individuals and families.

All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in a Corporate category. Corporate includes corporate treasury and staff functions, net of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, liquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable operating segments, as well as our investment portfolio and affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships. Corporate also includes certain lines of business that management has determined are no longer consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company. In addition, Corporate includes results for previously divested businesses.

Our management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP with specific adjustments, such as for funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, for shared revenues and expenses, and tax-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, selected business metrics for each operating segment are used by management in assessing performance and trends. 

Corporate treasury activities include the administration of a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics and results in a funding charge or credit in net interest income based on the composition of operating segment assets and liabilities. In addition, reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and revised.

The Company has also updated its revenue sharing and expense allocation methodologies. When operating segments jointly serve customers, the operating segment that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee or allocation of costs to the other operating segment. The Company’s management reporting process reflects the results of operating segments on a taxable-equivalent basis with income tax credits related to low-income housing and renewable energy investments and tax-exempt income on certain loans and securities included as revenue. These tax credits and benefits are eliminated to reconcile to the Company's consolidated financial results. 

Prior period reportable operating segment results have been revised to reflect this reorganization. The reorganization did not impact the previously reported consolidated financial results of the Company.
