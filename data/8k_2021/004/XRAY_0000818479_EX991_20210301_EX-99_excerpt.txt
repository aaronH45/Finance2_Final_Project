Charlotte, N.C., March 1, 2021 - DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (“Dentsply Sirona” or the "Company") (Nasdaq: XRAY), The Dental Solutions Company, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020.

Fourth quarter net sales of $1.08 billion decreased 2.6%, compared to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $99 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $102 million, or $0.46 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis Non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share grew 19.2% to $0.87 compared to $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2019. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to earnings per share calculated on a GAAP basis is provided in the attached table. 

Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer, commented “Our fourth quarter results reflect the continued focus on disciplined execution and the gradual recovery in global dental markets. Our team delivered strong operational performance, exceeding our expectations across most metrics including operating margin expansion, healthy EPS growth and cash flow generation. We capped off the year with the strategic acquisition of Byte, a rapidly growing direct-to-consumer, doctor-directed clear aligner company. This acquisition is key to accelerating our growth in the clear aligner space. While uncertainty remains on the timing and extent of a full recovery in the dental market, our 2021 outlook reflects our confidence in our portfolio and our commitment to driving growth through strategic investments.”

Q4 20 and FY 20 Summary Results (Non-GAAP)[1]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[1] Organic sales growth, Non-GAAP operating income, and Non-GAAP EPS are Non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items. Please refer to "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for a description of these measures and to the tables at the end of this release for a reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP measures. 

Segment Results

Consumables

Fourth quarter 2020 net sales were $449 million, up 1.6% versus prior year. Currency favorably impacted sales by 1.8%, while divestitures and discontinued products negatively impacted sales by 1.3%. On an organic basis, net sales increased by 1.1%. Sales of Restorative and Preventive consumables rebounded in the quarter but were partially offset by declines in Lab.

Technologies & Equipment

Fourth quarter 2020 net sales were $633 million, down 5.4% versus prior year. Currency favorably impacted sales by 3.0%, while divestitures and discontinued products decreased sales growth by 2.2%. On an organic basis, net sales declined by 6.2% as compared to prior year. The decline in organic sales was driven by the difficult CAD/CAM comp in 2019, partially offset by growth in clear aligners. 

Cash Flow and Liquidity

Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $263 million, as compared to $299 million in the prior year. Full year 2020 operating cash flow was consistent with full year 2019. In the fourth quarter, the Company paid $22 million in dividends, bringing a total of $228 million returned to shareholders in 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $438 million of cash available on its balance sheet.

Fiscal Year 2021 Outlook

We expect fiscal year 2021 revenue in the range of $4.0B to $4.3B, up 20% to 30% on a reported basis and up 15% to 25% on an organic basis1. We expect adjusted operating income margin2 of at least 20%. FY2021 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.80. 

Further 2021 planning assumptions are included in the Q4 FY2020 Earnings Presentation posted at www.dentsplysirona.com. The Company does not provide forward-looking estimates on a GAAP basis as certain information is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated.

Please refer to "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for a description of these measures and to the tables at the end of this release for a reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP measures.

2 Dentsply Sirona does not provide GAAP figures for these financial measures on a forward-looking basis, because the Company believes it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. These reconciling items include the impact of prospective acquisitions, acquisitions announced but not yet closed and other non-GAAP items, including restructuring costs and various other factors, many of which are difficult to predict.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”) the Company provides certain measures in this press release, described below, which are not calculated in accordance with US GAAP and therefore represent Non-GAAP measures. These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The Company discloses these measures to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and which may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating results including net sales, operating income, and net income.

Organic Sales

The Company defines "organic sales" as the increase or decrease in net sales excluding: (1) net sales from acquired and divested businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition or divestiture, (2) net sales attributable to discontinued product lines in both the current and prior year periods, and (3) the impact of foreign currency translation, which is calculated by translating current period sales using the comparable prior periods currency conversion rates. Organic sales is an important internal measure for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes organic sales and the performance of the Company is measured on this metric along with other performance metrics.

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted Common Share

The adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona consists of net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona adjusted to exclude the following:

(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to consummating and integrating acquired businesses, as well as net gains and losses related to the disposed businesses. In addition, this category includes the subsequent impact roll-off to the consolidated statements of operations which results from fair value adjustments related to business combinations, except for amortization expense of purchased intangible assets noted below. Although the Company is regularly engaged in activities to find and act on opportunities for strategic growth and enhancement of product offerings, the costs associated with these activities may vary significantly between periods based on the timing, size and complexity of acquisitions and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company. They are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends.

(2) Restructuring program related costs and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives as well as certain other costs. These costs can include, but are not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract termination costs and related professional service costs, duplicate facility and labor costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives. Other costs include legal settlements and impairments of assets. The Company's restructuring programs usually require several years to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. While restructuring charges are recurring, they are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur. 

9

(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting. Although these costs contribute to revenue generation and will recur in future periods, their amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions.

(4) Credit risk and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include both the cost and income impacts of adjustments in certain assets and liabilities including the Company’s pension obligations, that are recorded through net income which are related to the changes in fair value and credit risk. Although this non-service component of pension expense is a recurring item, it is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, global financial markets (including stock market returns and interest rate changes), plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances. These items can be variable and driven more by market conditions than the Company’s operating performance. 

(5) Income tax related adjustments. These adjustments include both income tax expenses and income tax benefits that are representative of income tax adjustments mostly related to prior periods, as well as the final settlement of income tax audits, and discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation. Income tax related adjustments may also include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate. These adjustments are irregular in timing the variability in amounts may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.

Both adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS are important internal measures for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS. The performance of the Company is measured on these metrics along with other performance metrics.

Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Margin

In addition to reporting operating income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted operating income (loss) and margin. The Company defines "adjusted operating income (loss)" as operating income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP excluding certain items noted above which are excluded on a pre-tax basis to arrive at adjusted operating income (loss), a Non-GAAP measure. The adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income (loss) by net sales. Both adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating margin are important internal measures for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted operating income (loss) and margin. The performance of the Company is measured on these metrics along with the adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS metrics noted above as well as other performance metrics.
