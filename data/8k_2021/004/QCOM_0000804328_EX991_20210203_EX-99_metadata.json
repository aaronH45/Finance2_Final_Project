        "(2) At fiscal year end, the quarterly tax provision for each column equals the annual tax provision (benefit) for each column computed in accordance with GAAP. In interim quarters, the sum of these provisions (benefits) may not equal the total GAAP tax provision, and this difference is included in the tax provision (benefit) in the “Other Items” column. Tax benefit in the “Other Items” column included $78 million of foreign currency gains related to a noncurrent receivable resulting from our refund claim of Korean withholding taxes paid in prior periods, a $19 million tax benefit from the effects of the new U.S. Treasury regulations on prior periods, a $7 million tax benefit for the tax effect of acquisition-related charges and a $1 million tax benefit from the combined effect of other items in EBT, partially offset by a $6 million charge to reconcile the tax provision of each column to the total GAAP tax provision for the quarter."
