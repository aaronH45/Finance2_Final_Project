Management Commentary

William J. Stromberg, president and chief executive officer, commented: “Markets entered 2020 on solid footing but, as the extent of the coronavirus pandemic grew, economic activity slowed to a crawl and risk assets of all kinds quickly fell into bear market territory. The economic recession and associated bear market wound up being the shortest on record as unprecedented government and central bank stimulus programs, along with an easing of lockdowns, led to a rapid recovery of economic activity and asset prices. For the year, revenues grew 10.5% due to the strong recovery in global markets and full-year positive net flows were $5.6 billion. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 15.2%, adjusted diluted earnings per common share grew 18.7%, and we returned $2.0 billion to stockholders through the annual dividend and the repurchase of 10.9 million shares at an average price of $109.30.

“After a choppy start in October, the fourth quarter saw strong market gains with the approval of coronavirus vaccines and clarity on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Positive Q4 net flows of $2.2 billion were driven by international equity and U.S. fixed income, while U.S. equity and target date experienced outflows. EMEA and APAC continued to perform well with positive net flows predominately to equity in both regions. Highlights for the quarter include:

▪The announcement of our plan to establish T. Rowe Price Investment Management (TRPIM), a separate U.S.-based SEC-registered investment advisor, to support the firm’s continued focus on generating strong investment results for clients. Longer term, having two distinct investment platforms with independent research teams will allow the firm to generate new capacity while retaining its scale benefits.

▪The approval of our business license for our wholly foreign owned enterprise, T. Rowe Price Investment Consulting (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. This is a critical step of our plans to open a Shanghai investment office in 2021 to expand our research coverage of Chinese companies. 

▪The hiring of a new global head of diversity and inclusion, an important step in our commitment to attracting, developing, and retaining diverse talent and creating an ever more inclusive workplace. 

“I am exceptionally proud of our associates around the world who rose to the occasion to meet the unforeseen challenges of 2020. They have worked tirelessly to deliver for our clients and support each other while staying true to our values.” 

Assets Under Management

During Q4 2020, assets under management increased $160.1 billion to $1.47 trillion. Net cash inflows were 

$2.2 billion, and clients transferred $2.5 billion in net assets from the U.S. mutual funds primarily to collective investment trusts and other investment products, of which $.9 billion transferred into the retirement date trusts. The components of the change in assets under management, by vehicle and asset class, are shown in the tables below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The underlying assets under management of the multi-asset portfolios have been aggregated and presented in this category and not reported in the equity and fixed income columns.

(2) Includes distributions not reinvested.

Assets under management in the firm's target date retirement products, which are reported as part of the multi-asset column in the table above, were $332.2 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $296.6 billion at 

September 30, 2020, and $292.4 billion at December 31, 2019. These portfolios experienced net cash outflows of 

$1.5 billion in Q4 2020 and $6.5 billion in 2020. 

Investors domiciled outside the United States accounted for 9.3% of the firm's assets under management at December 31, 2020 and 6.9% at December 31, 2019.

The firm provides participant accounting and plan administration for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the firm's U.S. mutual funds and collective investment trusts, as well as funds outside of the firm's complex. As of 

December 31, 2020, the firm's assets under administration were $239 billion, of which nearly $148 billion are assets we manage. 

3

In recent years, the firm began offering non-discretionary advisory services through model delivery, which are managed accounts where portfolio holdings and trades in the portfolio are provided to sponsor platforms to implement for their clients. The firm records the revenue earned on these services in administrative fees. The assets under advisement in these portfolios, predominantly in the United States, were $2.8 billion at December 31, 2020.

Financial Results

Net revenues earned in Q4 2020 were $1.7 billion, up 18.0% from Q4 2019. Average assets under management in Q4 2020 were $1.39 trillion, an increase of 20.0% from Q4 2019. The firm voluntarily waived money market advisory fees in Q4 2020 of $11.3 million to maintain positive yields for investors. We expect to continue to waive fees in 2021.

▪Investment advisory revenues earned in Q4 2020 from the firm's U.S. mutual funds were $1.0 billion, an increase of 11.9% from Q4 2019. Average assets under management in these funds increased 14.6% to $758.2 billion in Q4 2020 from Q4 2019. 

▪Investment advisory revenues earned in Q4 2020 from subadvised funds, separate accounts, collective investment trusts and other investment products were $601.1 million, an increase of 33.6% from Q4 2019. Average assets under management for these products increased 27.1% to $635.8 billion in Q4 2020 from Q4 2019. The fourth quarter of 2020 revenue includes $20.4 million in performance-based fees.

▪The annualized effective fee rate of 45.7 basis points in Q4 2020 was down slightly from 45.9 basis points earned in Q4 2019 as the impact of client transfers to lower fee vehicles or share classes within the complex over the last twelve months and money market fee waivers were largely offset by performance-based fees earned during the 2020 quarter. The performance-based fees earned in Q4 2020 are also the primary reason for the increase in the annualized effective fee rate in Q4 2020 compared to the 45.2 basis points earned in Q3 2020. Over time, the firm's effective fee rate can be impacted by market or cash flow related shifts among asset and share classes, price changes in existing products, and asset level changes in products with tiered-fee structures. 

▪Administrative, distribution, and servicing fees in Q4 2020 were $130.7 million, an increase of 5.4% from Q4 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher transfer agent servicing activities provided to the T. Rowe Price mutual funds. 

Operating expenses in Q4 2020 were $977.0 million, an increase of 10.0% compared to Q4 2019. The increase in the firm's operating expenses from the 2019 quarter was primarily due to a $45.1 million increase in expense related to the supplemental savings plan from higher market returns, and secondarily to higher compensation expenses. These higher expenses were offset in part by lower general and administrative costs, primarily lower travel-related 

4

expenses. The expense related to the supplemental savings plan was largely offset by the non-operating gains earned on the investments used to economically hedge the related liability. 

On a non-GAAP basis, the firm's operating expenses in Q4 2020 were $908.5 million, a 5.2% increase over 

Q4 2019. The firm's non-GAAP operating expenses do not include the impact of the supplemental savings plan and consolidated sponsored products. 

▪Compensation and related costs were $640.4 million in Q4 2020, an increase of 21.2% compared to 

Q4 2019. This increase was primarily related to the $45.1 million in higher expense for the supplemental savings plan, as strong market returns in Q4 2020 increased the liability compared with the impact of market returns in Q4 2019. Also contributing to the increase in 2020 costs were higher annual bonuses, salaries and benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. The firm's average staff size in Q4 2020 increased 5.2% over prior year and we employed 7,678 associates at December 31, 2020, an increase of 4.2% from the end of 2019. 

▪Distribution and servicing costs were $77.3 million in Q4 2020, an increase of 15.0% from 

the $67.2 million recognized in Q4 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher distribution costs as a result of continued inflows and market appreciation in the firm's international products, including the Japanese Investment Trusts.

▪Advertising and promotion expenses were $31.2 million in Q4 2020, a decrease of 18.5% over Q4 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower media costs and fewer conference and promotional events as a result of cancellations due to the coronavirus pandemic.

▪Technology, occupancy, and facility costs were $112.5 million in Q4 2020, a decrease of 4.5% from the $117.8 million recognized in Q4 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the absence in Q4 2020 of nonrecurring office facility costs that were recognized in Q4 2019. This decrease was partially offset by the ongoing investment in the firm's technology capabilities, including related depreciation and hosted solution licenses, and higher office lease costs. 

▪General, administrative, and other costs were $78.1 million in Q4 2020, a decrease of 21.3% compared with the $99.3 million recognized in Q4 2019. The decrease was due to lower travel-related expenses, professional fees, and other administrative expenses. 

For 2020, operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased 7.1% compared to 2019, and 6.1% on a non-GAAP basis. 

5

The firm has increased its 2021 non-GAAP operating expense growth range to 8%-12%, from the 6%-9% provided in October as sharp market returns in Q4 2020 and current AUM levels have increased the firm's expectations for AUM-related expenses. The firm could elect to further adjust its expense growth should unforeseen circumstances arise, including significant market movements. 

Non-operating income. Non-operating income was $390.1 million in Q4 2020, as compared to non-operating income of $170.0 million in Q4 2019. The firm's consolidated investment products and supplemental savings plan hedge portfolio comprised about 77% of the net gains recognized during Q4 2020. The cash and discretionary investment portfolio added net investment gains of $42.5 million during Q4 2020. The components of non-operating income for Q4 2020 and Q4 2019 are included in the tables at the end of this release. 

Income taxes. The firm's effective tax rate was 18.9% in Q4 2020 and 20.8% in Q4 2019. For the full year, the firm's effective tax rate was 22.2% in 2020 compared with 23.2% in 2019. The following reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to the firm's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2020 and 2019:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) State income tax benefits are reflected in the total benefits for net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and stock-based compensation plans activity.

(2) Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest represents the portion of earnings held in the firm's consolidated investment products, which are not taxable to the firm despite being included in pre-tax income..

The firm's non-GAAP tax rate primarily adjusts for the impact of the consolidated investment products, including the net income attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interests. The firm's non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.8% for Q4 2020 and 23.3% for the full year 2020. For both periods, the rates were impacted by a lower effective state tax rate as we continue to see the phased-in benefit of the 2018 Maryland state tax legislation and higher discrete tax benefits associated with the settlement of stock-based awards given the rise in our stock price in 2020. Based on information currently available, the firm expects that the 2018 Maryland state tax legislation will reduce our effective state tax rate over the five-year phase-in period to less than 3%.

The firm estimates that its effective tax rate for the full year 2021, on a GAAP basis, will be in the range of 22% to 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, the range is 23% to 25%.

Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation

The firm believes the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about its core operating results. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating the firm's core business, for comparing current results with prior period results, and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers. However, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) These non-GAAP adjustments remove the impact that the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products have on the firm's U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, the firm adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products. The adjustment to operating expenses represents the operating expenses of the consolidated products, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group represents the net income of the consolidated products, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. Management believes the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products may impact the reader’s ability to understand the firm's core operating results.

(2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense impact from market valuation changes in the supplemental savings plan liability and the related net gains (losses) on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by participants. The firm uses T. Rowe Price investment products to economically hedge the exposure to these market movements. Management believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income (loss) realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and to increase comparability period to period.

(3) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the other non-operating income (loss) and the net gains (losses) earned on the firm's non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the supplemental savings plan liability, and that are not part of the cash and discretionary investment portfolio. Management retains the investment gains recognized on the non-consolidated cash and discretionary investments as these assets and related income (loss) are considered part of the firm's core operations. Management believes adjusting for these non-operating income (loss) items helps the reader’s ability to understand the firm's core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, management does not emphasize the impact of the portion of non-operating income (loss) removed when managing and evaluating the firm's performance.

(4) The income tax impacts were calculated in order to achieve an overall year-to-date non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23.3% for 2020 and 24.0% for 2019. As such, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for both the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 21.8%. The firm estimates that its effective tax rate for the full-year 2021 on a non-GAAP basis will be in the range of 23% to 25%.

(5) This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution. The calculation of adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders is as follows:
