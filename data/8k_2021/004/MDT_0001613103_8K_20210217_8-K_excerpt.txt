Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure

On February 17, 2021, Medtronic plc (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing its voluntary global recall of its Valiant Navion™ Thoracic Stent Graft System. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. 

The Company is providing the following additional details related to its voluntary global recall of its Valiant Navion™ Thoracic Stent Graft System. Medtronic does not expect this voluntary global recall to have a material impact on its total company financials. The company’s Valiant Navion™ revenue, prior to this recall, represented less than 0.5% of total Company revenue.

As a substitute for the Valiant Navion™, Medtronic is working to ramp production of its previous generation product, the Valiant Captivia™ Thoracic Stent Graft System, over the coming weeks and resume selling this product in markets globally. The Company expects to have Valiant Captivia™ inventory available in most markets in late March or early April and expects to reach full production capacity in September.

The Company has booked a $19 million reserve to cover the estimated cost of scrapping its Valiant Navion™ inventory. This charge will appear in the company’s third quarter of fiscal year 2021 cost of products sold, which the company will report on February 23, 2021. The company does not expect to adjust its third quarter earnings for this charge.

While it is difficult to estimate the revenue impact of this global recall at this time, based on current assumptions, the Company estimates that its current quarter, the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, Aortic, Peripheral and Venous (APV) division revenue, which is reported within the Cardiac and Vascular Group, could be negatively affected by approximately $40 million. Similarly, based on current assumptions, the company also estimates that its APV revenue could be negatively affected by approximately $25 to $35 million per quarter in fiscal year 2022, decreasing through the fiscal year.

The information in this Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including risks related to, the impact COVID-19 has had and is expected to continue to have on our business, operations and production, as well as demand for our offerings, and on our employees, medical professional and the healthcare system, communities in which we operate, and our financial results and condition, competitive factors, difficulties and delays inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical products, government regulation and general economic conditions and other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s periodic reports on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission including the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
