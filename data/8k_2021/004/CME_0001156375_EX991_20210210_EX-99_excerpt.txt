 CHICAGO, February 10, 2021 - CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CME) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020.

On an adjusted basis, net income was $497 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.39.

 "As the ongoing global pandemic created an environment of extreme uncertainty and market volatility, we remained highly focused on helping our clients manage risk that was impacting their businesses," said CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy. "Despite the challenges, we achieved record international volume during full-year 2020 and saw strong, double-digit, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter across our Equity Index and Agricultural businesses. Since the start of 2021, we completed the migration of our BrokerTec business to CME Globex, unlocking additional value and cost efficiencies for our clients who can now access listed derivatives, cash and repo markets on a common platform. Looking ahead, we will continue to deliver innovative products that can address our clients' evolving needs, including Q1 launches for Ether futures, Global Emissions Offset futures and Japanese energy futures."

 Fourth-quarter 2020 average daily volume (ADV) was 16.2 million contracts. Non-U.S. ADV for full-year 2020 reached a record 5.3 million contracts.
