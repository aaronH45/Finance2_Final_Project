This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed in connection with the completion of the transactions contemplated by that certain Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Amended Merger Agreement”), dated as of October 28, 2020, by and among Tiffany & Co. (“Registrant”), LVMH Moët Hennessy-Louis Vuitton SE, a societas Europaea (European company) organized under the laws of France (“LVMH”), Breakfast Holdings Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of LVMH (“Holding”) and Breakfast Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Holding (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Registrant (the “Merger”), with Registrant continuing as the surviving company in the Merger and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of LVMH (the “Surviving Corporation”).  

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Registrant (“Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock owned by Registrant, LVMH or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, and shares of Common Stock owned by stockholders of Registrant who have properly demanded and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights under Delaware law) was converted into the right to receive $131.50 in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”).  

Prior to the Effective Time, Registrant’s executive officers and employees held various types of compensatory awards with respect to the Common Stock and Registrant’s non-employee directors held awards of restricted shares and stock options. The Amended Merger Agreement provided for the treatment with respect to such awards. For additional information regarding the Amended Merger Agreement’s treatment of these compensatory awards, please see Registrant’s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 27, 2020, which is incorporated herein by reference.
