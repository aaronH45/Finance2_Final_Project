“Our fourth quarter and full year results highlighted the value of our diversified business model, which allowed us to deliver industry-leading results for our shareholders despite the economic headwinds the entire banking industry faced. This was an extraordinary year that brought both challenges and opportunities. I’m proud of how we came together to support our customers and communities as they faced various individual obstacles brought on by COVID-19 and other global issues.

     U.S. Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2020 Results 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $1,519 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, which was 2.2 percent higher than the $1,486 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, and 3.9 percent lower than the $1,580 million for the third quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.95 in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $0.90 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $0.99 in the third quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2019 included $(0.18) per diluted common share of notable items related to restructuring charges including severance and certain asset impairments, and an increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the Company.  

The increase in net income year-over-year was primarily due to higher noninterest income as well as lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net interest income and higher provision for credit losses. The components of net income are being adversely impacted by the COVID-19 environment resulting in significantly lower interest rates and consumer and business spending activities as well as changes in credit quality. The provision for credit losses takes into account expected loss estimates considering various factors including the economic outlook, changing credit quality, ongoing new loan production and acquired loans. Net interest income decreased 0.9 percent on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to the impact of lower rates compared with a year ago, partially offset by the benefit of deposit and funding mix, loan growth and higher loan fees. The net interest margin declined from a year ago to 2.57 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily due to the impact of a lower yield curve, loan mix, decisions to maintain higher levels of liquidity, and higher premium amortization within the investment portfolio, partially offset by the net benefit of deposit repricing and funding composition. Noninterest income increased 4.7 percent compared with a year ago, driven by significant growth in mortgage banking revenue due to refinancing production and growth in commercial products revenue primarily due to commitment fees on unused lines. Growth in these fee categories was partially offset by a decline in payment services revenue and deposit service charges related to lower consumer and business spending. Excluding a prior year notable item in other noninterest income for a valuation charge of $140 million for an increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the Company, total noninterest income decreased 1.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Noninterest expense decreased 1.1 percent despite approximately $22 million of costs related to the COVID-19 environment and an increase in revenue-related production expenses of approximately $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding prior year notable items in other noninterest expense related to severance charges and other accruals of $200 million, total noninterest expense increased 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 reflecting business investments, COVID-19 costs and revenue-related expenses.

     U.S. Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2020 Results 

Net income decreased on a linked quarter basis primarily due to lower total net revenue, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses. The Company’s pre-provision income decreased 7.9 percent on a linked quarter basis, driven by lower total net revenue of 3.6 percent, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense of 0.2 percent on a linked quarter basis. Net interest income decreased 1.6 percent primarily due to a decline in average loan balances, higher premium amortization expense and lower reinvestment yields in the investment portfolio, partially offset by the benefit of deposit and funding mix as well as higher loan fees. The net interest margin decreased on a linked quarter basis, primarily reflecting the impact of higher cash balances and premium amortization. Noninterest income decreased 6.0 percent compared with the third quarter of 2020 driven by lower payment services revenue, deposit service charges, commercial products revenue and mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher other noninterest income driven by tax-advantaged investment syndication revenue in the fourth quarter. Noninterest expense decreased 0.2 percent on a linked quarter basis, reflecting lower personnel expense, mostly offset by continued business investment in digital capabilities and business development expense.

(a) Excludes unrealized gain (loss)  

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $3,201 million, a decrease of $30 million (0.9 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower rates compared with a year ago, partially offset by deposit and funding mix, loan growth and higher loan fees. Average earning assets were $57.7 billion (13.1 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting increases of $7.4 billion (2.5 percent) in average total loans, $11.8 billion (9.7 percent) in average investment securities, and $34.9 billion in average other earning assets including cash balances being maintained for liquidity given the current economic environment.  

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis decreased $51 million (1.6 percent) on a linked quarter basis primarily due to a decline in average loan balances, higher premium amortization expense and lower reinvestment yields in the investment portfolio, partially offset by the benefit of deposit and funding mix as well as higher loan fees. Average earning assets were $11.3 billion (2.3 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis, reflecting increases of $4.9 billion (3.8 percent) in average investment securities and $14.3 billion (37.1 percent) in average other earning assets, partially offset by a decrease of $8.7 billion (2.8 percent) in average total loans, primarily due to continued paydowns by corporate customers that accessed the capital markets during the year.  

The net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 2.57 percent, compared with 2.92 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2.67 percent in the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in the net interest margin from the prior year was primarily due to the impact of a lower yield curve and decisions to maintain higher cash balances for liquidity, partially offset by deposit and funding mix. The decrease in net interest margin on a linked quarter basis reflects the impact of higher cash balances and premium amortization in the investment portfolio, partially offset by favorable loan and deposit mix. The Company’s higher liquidity levels, on a linked quarter basis, were related to the acquisition of approximately $10 billion of deposit balances from State Farm Bank in the fourth quarter of 2020.  

The increase in average investment securities on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis was due to purchases of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and state and political securities net of prepayments and maturities.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average total loans for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $7.4 billion (2.5 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher total commercial loans (2.4 percent), including the impact of loans made under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program, along with growth in residential mortgages (9.9 percent) given the lower interest rate environment and GNMA buybacks, in addition to growth in other retail loans (7.2 percent) driven by growth in installment loans due to the COVID-19 impact on recreational vehicle sales. These increases were partially offset by lower credit card loans (9.0 percent) and home equity and second mortgages (15.8 percent).  

Average total loans were $8.7 billion (2.8 percent) lower than the third quarter of 2020 primarily driven by lower total commercial loans (7.9 percent), reflecting continued paydowns by corporate customers, partially offset by higher residential mortgages (1.3 percent) given the lower interest rate environment and GNMA buybacks.

     U.S. Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2020 Results 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $66.0 billion (18.5 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, including approximately $10 billion related to the acquisition of deposit balances from State Farm Bank in the fourth quarter of 2020. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $40.8 billion (55.0 percent) across all business lines. Average total savings deposits were $35.4 billion (14.8. percent) higher year-over-year driven by Consumer and Business Banking, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services. Average time deposits were $10.3 billion (23.8 percent) lower than the prior year quarter. Changes in time deposits are largely related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics.  

Average total deposits increased $16.9 billion (4.2 percent) from the third quarter of 2020, including the acquired deposit balances. On a linked quarter basis, average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.8 billion (5.3 percent) driven by Corporate and Commercial Banking. Average total savings deposits increased $12.4 billion (4.7 percent) compared with the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to increases in Consumer and Business Banking and Wealth Management and Investment Services. Average time deposits, which are managed based on funding needs, relative pricing and liquidity characteristics, decreased $1.3 billion (3.8 percent) on a linked quarter basis primarily within Corporate and Commercial Banking, partially offset by increases in Consumer and Business Banking.  

The growth in average noninterest-bearing deposits and total average savings deposits year-over-year was primarily a result of the actions by the federal government to increase liquidity in the financial system, customers maintaining balance sheet liquidity by utilizing existing credit facilities and government stimulus programs. The year-over-year increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits in Payment Services was driven by state unemployment distributions on prepaid debit cards.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth quarter noninterest income of $2,550 million was $114 million (4.7 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, other noninterest income included a valuation charge of $140 million for an increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the Company. Excluding this notable item, noninterest income decreased $26 million (1.0 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 reflecting lower payment services revenue, deposit service charges and other noninterest income, partially offset by strong growth in mortgage banking revenue and higher commercial products revenue. Payment services revenue decreased $146 million (15.4 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by lower consumer and business spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit and debit card revenue was lower by $16 million (4.2 percent) due to lower net interchange revenue related to sales volumes, partially offset by higher prepaid fees as a result of government stimulus programs in 2020. Also impacting payment services revenue, corporate payment products revenue decreased $32 million (20.3 percent) and merchant processing services revenue deceased $98 million (24.0 percent) primarily due to lower sales volume. Deposit service charges decreased $66 million (28.6 percent) primarily due to lower consumer spending activities. Other noninterest income, excluding the prior year notable item, decreased $67 million (24.1 percent) driven by higher equity investment income in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by higher retail leasing end of term residual gains and tax-advantaged investment syndication revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. Partially offsetting these decreases, mortgage banking revenue experienced strong growth of $224 million (91.8 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 due to higher mortgage production driven by refinancing activities and stronger gain on sale margins, partially offset by the unfavorable net impact of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities. Commercial products revenue increased $13 million (5.8 percent) primarily due to higher commercial loan and commercial leasing fees.  

Noninterest income was $162 million (6.0 percent) lower in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the third quarter of 2020, reflecting lower payment services revenue, commercial products revenue and mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher other noninterest income and gains on the sale of securities. Payment services revenue decreased $61 million (7.1 percent) compared with the third quarter of 2020, in part due to seasonality. The decline was driven by $26 million (6.7 percent) lower credit and debit card revenue, primarily due to the timing of stimulus payments through prepaid card processing in the third quarter of 2020, and lower merchant processing services revenue of $36 million (10.4 percent) due to the impact of economic shutdowns in Europe and certain domestic regions and sales volumes. Commercial products revenue decreased $64 million (21.1 percent) primarily due to lower capital markets activities, partially offset by stronger commercial loan and commercial leasing fees. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $85 million (15.4 percent) due to lower production volume and related gain on sales as well as the unfavorable net impact of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities. Other noninterest income increased $24 million (12.8 percent) primarily due to higher tax-advantaged investment syndication revenue.

Fourth quarter noninterest expense of $3,364 million was $37 million (1.1 percent) lower than the fourth quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, other noninterest expense included notable items related to severance charges and other accruals of $200 million. The current quarter included approximately $118 million of incremental costs related to the prepaid card business ($44 million), expenses related to COVID-19 ($22 million) and revenue-related expenses ($52 million) primarily due to higher mortgage production in addition to business investments, including digital capabilities. Excluding the impact of the prior year notable items, noninterest expense increased $163 million (5.1 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 reflecting higher compensation expense, technology and communications expense and other noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net occupancy and equipment expense, professional services expense and marketing and business development expense. Compensation expense increased $46 million (2.9 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 due to merit and variable compensation related to business production in mortgage banking. Technology and communications expense increased $71 million (24.4 percent) primarily due to the impact of increased call center volume related to prepaid cards and capital expenditures supporting business technology investments. Other noninterest expense, excluding the prior year notable items, increased $98 million (28.7 percent) which reflected higher expenses for revenue-related costs and COVID-19, merger-related costs related to acquired deposits and higher state franchise taxes, partially offset by lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects. These increases were partially offset by lower net occupancy and equipment expense of $17 million (5.9 percent) due to branch optimization initiatives, lower professional services expense of $16 million (11.5 percent) primarily due to fewer initiatives in the current year and lower marketing and business development expense of $12 million (10.3 percent) due to a reduction in travel as a result of COVID-19.  

Noninterest expense decreased $7 million (0.2 percent) on a linked quarter basis reflecting lower compensation and employee benefits expense, mostly offset by higher professional services expense, marketing and business development expense and technology and communications expense. Compensation expense decreased $44 million (2.6 percent) primarily due to lower business incentives while employee benefits expense decreased $33 million (9.9 percent) primarily due to lower medical claims expense. Partially offsetting these decreases, professional services expense increased $21 million (20.6 percent) primarily due to seasonally higher spending on business investments. Marketing and business development expense increased $33 million (45.8 percent) due to the timing of marketing campaigns supporting business development, and technology and communications expense increased $28 million (8.4 percent) driven by increased call center volume related to prepaid debit cards and software license expense.  

Provision for Income Taxes  

The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in a tax rate of 21.6 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis (effective tax rate of 20.6 percent), compared with 20.2 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis (effective tax rate of 19.2 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2019, and a tax rate of 19.0 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis (effective tax rate of 18.0 percent) in the third quarter of 2020.

The Company’s provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $441 million, which was $194 million lower than the prior quarter and $46 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2020, economic conditions continued to moderate in line with management’s expectations. Economic projections for both the gross domestic product and unemployment levels improved from the third quarter. In addition to these factors, expected loss estimates consider various factors including potential mitigating effects of government stimulus, estimated duration and severity of the health crisis, customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies and the impact of industry-wide loan modification efforts designed to limit long term effects of the pandemic, among other factors.  

Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $441 million, compared with $515 million in the third quarter of 2020, and $385 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The net charge-off ratio was 0.58 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with 0.66 percent in the third quarter of 2020 and 0.52 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net charge-offs decreased $74 million (14.4 percent) compared with the third quarter of 2020 mainly due to lower total commercial and credit card net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $56 million (14.5 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 primarily due to higher total commercial and total commercial real estate net charge-offs, partly offset by lower credit card and other retail net charge-offs. The year-over-year increase in retail leasing net charge-offs reflects the inclusion of end of term losses on residual lease values as of January 1, 2020.  

The allowance for credit losses was $8,010 million at December 31, 2020, and at September 30, 2020, compared with $4,491 million at December 31, 2019. The increase year-over-year was due to the impact of the change in accounting principle on January 1, 2020, which added $1.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses, along with the reserve build driven by the potential economic impact of COVID-19. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.69 percent at December 31, 2020, compared with 2.61 percent at September 30, 2020, and 1.52 percent at December 31, 2019. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 654 percent at December 31, 2020, compared with 678 percent at September 30, 2020, and 649 percent at December 31, 2019.  

Nonperforming assets were $1,298 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $1,270 million at September 30, 2020, and $829 million at December 31, 2019. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.44 percent at December 31, 2020, compared with 0.41 percent at September 30, 2020, and 0.28 percent at December 31, 2019. The year-over-year increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to increases in total commercial and total commercial real estate nonperforming loans. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due were $506 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $461 million at September 30, 2020, and $605 million at December 31, 2019. The Company expects credit quality metrics, including nonperforming assets, to remain elevated and volatility in net charge-offs given current economic conditions.

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $53.1 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $52.6 billion at September 30, 2020, and $51.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Beginning in March and continuing through the remainder of 2020, the Company suspended all common stock repurchases except for those done exclusively in connection with its stock-based compensation programs. This action was initially taken to maintain strong capital levels given the impact and uncertainties of COVID-19 on the economy and global markets. Due to continued economic uncertainty, the Federal Reserve Board implemented measures beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and extending through the first quarter of 2021, restricting capital distributions of all large bank holding companies, including U.S. Bancorp. These restrictions include capping common stock dividends at existing rates and limiting the aggregate amount of common stock dividends and share repurchases to an amount not exceeding the average net income of the four preceding calendar quarters. Based on the results of the December 2020 Federal Reserve Stress Test the Company announced its Board of Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of its common stock beginning January 1, 2021.  

All regulatory ratios continue to be in excess of “well-capitalized” requirements. The common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.7 percent at December 31, 2020, compared with 9.4 percent at September 30, 2020, and 9.1 percent at December 31, 2019. The Company’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the current expected credit losses methodology was 9.3 percent at December 31, 2020, compared with 9.0 percent at September 30, 2020.

Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting U.S. Bancorp, its customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the ultimate extent of the impacts on its business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity, and prospects is uncertain. Continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions or turbulence in domestic or global financial markets could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities, reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions, lead to a tightening of credit, and increase stock price volatility. In addition, changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or practices could affect U.S. Bancorp in substantial and unpredictable ways. U.S. Bancorp’s results could also be adversely affected by changes in interest rates; further increases in unemployment rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of its investment securities; legal and regulatory developments; litigation; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; civil unrest; changes in customer behavior and preferences; breaches in data security; failures to safeguard personal information; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management’s ability to effectively manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and reputation risk.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

   •    

Tangible common equity to tangible assets    

   •    

Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets    

   •    

Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the current expected credit losses methodology, and    

   •    

Return on tangible common equity.    

These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are subject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily exclude the impact of 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the current expected credit losses methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the Company’s capital adequacy.  

The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.  

There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures.

Lines of Business  

The Company’s major lines of business are Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Business line results are derived from the Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s diverse customer base. During 2020, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.

Corporate and Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital markets services, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients.  

Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $394 million of the Company’s net income in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $403 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total net revenue decreased $25 million (2.6 percent) due to a decrease of $35 million (4.5 percent) in net interest income, partially offset by an increase of $10 million (5.1 percent) in total noninterest income. Net interest income decreased primarily due to loan mix and the impact of declining interest rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by deposit mix with higher noninterest-bearing balances and stronger loan fees. Total noninterest income increased year-over-year primarily due to higher commercial loan and commercial leasing fees. Total noninterest expense declined $9 million (2.3 percent) compared with a year ago primarily driven by lower production incentives, partially offset by higher other noninterest expense driven by legal costs. The provision for credit losses decreased $4 million (9.3 percent) primarily due to a favorable change in the reserve allocation driven by reduced funded exposures, partially offset by credit risk rating downgrades.

Consumer and Business Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM processing and mobile devices. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking and indirect lending, as well as mortgage banking.  

Consumer and Business Banking contributed $737 million of the Company’s net income in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $550 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total net revenue increased $244 million (11.1 percent) due to an increase in net interest income of $70 million (4.4 percent) and an increase of $174 million (28.2 percent) in total noninterest income. Net interest income reflects strong growth in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposit balances, loan growth, and higher loan fees, driven in part by loans made under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program and GNMA buybacks, in addition to favorable loan spreads. These favorable changes are partially offset by the impact of declining interest rates on deposit spreads. Total noninterest income increased primarily due to growth in mortgage banking revenue driven by higher mortgage production and stronger gain on sale margins, partially offset by the unfavorable net impact of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities. Other noninterest income increased primarily due to higher retail leasing end of term residual gains. These increases in noninterest income were partially offset by lower deposit service charges primarily due to lower volume. Total noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 increased $72 million (5.3 percent) primarily due to business investments, higher variable compensation related to strong mortgage banking origination activities, and higher other noninterest expense due to higher mortgage loan processing costs. The provision for credit losses decreased $77 million (82.8 percent) due to a favorable change in the reserve allocation primarily reflecting a reduction in end of period outstanding balances in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 and improved collateral support in consumer portfolios.

Total net revenue decreased $50 million (6.7 percent) year-over-year reflecting a decrease in net interest income of $55 million (19.9 percent), partly offset by an increase of $5 million (1.1 percent) in noninterest income. Net interest income decreased year-over-year primarily due to the declining margin benefit of deposits, given lower interest rates, partially offset by higher noninterest-bearing deposits and favorable deposit mix. Total noninterest income increased primarily due to business growth on trust and investment management fees and the impact of favorable market conditions, partially offset by higher fee waivers related to money market funds. Total noninterest expense increased $24 million (5.1 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 reflecting increased technology development and higher other noninterest expense from litigation settlements partially offset by lower other noninterest expense due to a reduction in travel as a result of COVID-19. The provision for credit losses increased $8 million reflecting an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation primarily driven by stronger growth in outstanding loans in the fourth quarter of 2020 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019.

Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit and merchant processing.  

Payment Services contributed $276 million of the Company’s net income in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $385 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total net revenue decreased $142 million (8.9 percent) primarily due to a decline of $145 million (15.3 percent) in total noninterest income. Net interest income increased primarily due to higher deposit balances as a result of state unemployment programs utilizing prepaid debit cards and funding mix, mostly offset by lower loan volume and loan fees, and the declining margin benefit of deposits. Total noninterest income decreased year-over-year mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 on consumer and business spending volume in merchant processing services and corporate payment products. The decrease in credit and debit card revenue was due to lower net interchange revenue driven by lower credit card sales offset somewhat by stronger debit card spending volumes. This was partially offset by higher prepaid fees as a result of government stimulus programs in 2020. Total noninterest expense increased $68 million (8.4 percent) reflecting incremental costs related to the prepaid card business and higher marketing and business development expense due to the timing of certain marketing campaigns in support of business development. The provision for credit losses decreased $64 million (23.9 percent) due to slower loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by rising delinquency rates in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Total net revenue increased $57 million (36.3 percent) year-over-year due to an increase of $70 million (35.4 percent) in total noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income of $13 million (31.7 percent). Net interest income decreased primarily due to higher prepayment amortization and lower reinvestment yields within the investment portfolio compared with a year ago. Total noninterest income increased primarily due to the $(140) million fourth quarter of 2019 notable item for an increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the Company. Excluding this notable item, noninterest income decreased, driven by higher equity investment income in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by tax-advantaged investment syndication revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. Total noninterest expense decreased $192 million (53.5 percent) primarily due to the $200 million fourth quarter of 2019 notable items related to severance charges and other accruals. Excluding these notable items, noninterest expense increased which reflected higher expenses for COVID-19, increased expense due to the timing of marketing campaigns, higher merger-related costs, and higher state franchise taxes, partially offset by lower net shared services expense and lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects. The provision for credit losses increased $183 million reflecting the residual impact of changes in the allowance for credit losses being impacted by adverse economic conditions and the expected impact to credit losses within the Company’s loan portfolios due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.
