Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On February 5, 2021, our Board of Directors amended and restated the Company's Bylaws. The Bylaws include a new Section 1.7, which permits a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials director candidates constituting up to the greater of 2 nominees or 20% of the Board, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Bylaws. The advance notice provision of Section 1.5 of the Bylaws was amended and a new Section 1.6 was included to require that proposals of business and stockholder nominations submitted pursuant to the bylaws must include information regarding material interests in the proposals or nominations, voting agreements and derivative and short positions, among other information. Section 2.01 of the Bylaws was amended to clarify the voting standards for contested director elections and eliminate the need for directors to provide resignation letters in advance of their election in the event they do not receive majority support, while maintaining majority voting standards in uncontested director elections. 

The summary description of the changes to the Bylaws is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.ii, and is incorporated herein by reference.
