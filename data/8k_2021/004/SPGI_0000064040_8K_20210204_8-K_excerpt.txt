Other Events.  

On February 4, 2021, S&P Global Inc. (the “Company”) voluntarily withdrew its filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), related to the Company’s proposed all-stock merger with IHS Markit Ltd. (“IHS Markit”) in order to provide the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) with additional time to review the merger.  

In accordance with the regulations under the HSR Act, the Company plans to resubmit its HSR Act filing on or about February 8, 2021, commencing a new 30-day waiting period under the HSR Act. Withdrawing and refiling pre-merger notifications is a standard procedure in order to provide additional time for antitrust review of certain transactions. The Company and IHS Markit continue to work constructively with the Antitrust Division staff in the Antitrust Division’s review of the proposed merger and continue to expect to consummate the merger in the second half of 2021, subject to the approval of S&P Global and IHS Markit shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other specified closing conditions.

These forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about future business and operating results, the industry and markets in which S&P Global Inc. (“S&P Global”) and IHS Markit Ltd. (“IHS Markit”) operate and beliefs of and assumptions made by S&P Global management and IHS Markit management, involve uncertainties that could significantly affect the financial or operating results of S&P Global, IHS Markit or the combined company. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “will, ” “should,” “may,” “projects,” “could,” “would,” “target,” “estimates” or variations of such words and other similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature, but not all forward-looking statements include such identifying words. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, projections of earnings, statements of plans for future operations or expected revenues, statements about the benefits of the transaction involving S&P Global and IHS Markit, including future financial and operating results and cost and revenue synergies, the combined company’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to creating value for shareholders, benefits of the proposed transaction to shareholders, employees, customers and other constituents of the combined company, the outcome of contingencies, future actions by regulators, changes in business strategies and methods of generating revenue, the development and performance of each company’s services and products, integrating our companies, cost savings, the expected timetable for completing the proposed transaction, general conditions in the geographic areas where we operate and our respective effective tax rates, cost structure, dividend policy, cash flows or liquidity — are forward-looking statements.
