Compensation Committee Approves 2021 Base Salaries for Named Executive Officers  

On February 23, 2021, upon the recommendation of the senior management team, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) approved the annual rate for the 2021 base salaries for our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and other named executive officers, as provided below. Certain of Mr. Henderson’s compensation is included throughout this report because he is expected to be a named executive officer in the Company’s definitive proxy statement to be filed for the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders.

Perry E. Davis, former EVP, President – Residential Products & Industrial Products (SVP – Operations, 1/1/2020 through 2/7/2020) retired February 7, 2020. Prior to his retirement, Mr. Davis received a base salary at the annual base rate of $530,000. Matthew C. Flanigan, former EVP & CFO, retired December 31, 2019.  

 2   

The 2020 annual base salary rates were originally approved by the Committee on November 4, 2019. Because of various cost-cutting measures adopted by the Company in response to the economic downturn and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates were reduced, effective April 12, 2020, by 50%. On June 29, 2020, effective July 5, 2020, the annual base salary rates were reinstated to their original levels.  

Compensation Committee Sets 2021 Target Percentages under the Key Officers Incentive Plan  

Except as noted below, the named executive officers will be eligible to receive an annual cash incentive under the 2020 Key Officers Incentive Plan (the “KOIP”), which was filed February 19, 2020 as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Form 8-K. Each executive’s cash award is to be calculated by multiplying his annual base salary at the end of the KOIP plan year by a percentage set by the Committee (the “Target Percentage”), then applying the award formula adopted by the Committee for that year. The Award Formula in 2020 and 2021 established two performance criteria: (i) Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) (60% Relative Weight), and (ii) Cash Flow, or Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) for Mr. Henderson (40% Relative Weight). The Target Percentages for 2020 and 2021 for the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and other named executive officers are shown in the following table.

Perry E. Davis, former EVP, President – Residential Products & Industrial Products (SVP – Operations, 1/1/2020 through 2/7/2020) retired February 7, 2020. Matthew C. Flanigan, former EVP & CFO, retired December 31, 2019. Neither Mr. Davis nor Mr. Flanigan participated in the KOIP in 2020 or 2021.  

Attached and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 10.1 is the Company’s updated Summary Sheet of Executive Cash Compensation.  

Adoption of 2021 Award Formula under the Company’s Key Officers Incentive Plan  

Our executive officers earn an annual cash incentive paid under the KOIP, based on achieving certain performance objectives for the year. On February 23, 2021 the Committee adopted the 2021 Award Formula (the “2021 KOIP Award Formula”) under the KOIP. The 2021 KOIP Award Formula is applicable to the Company’s executive officers, including the named executive officers listed below. Under the 2021 KOIP Award Formula, an executive officer is eligible to receive a cash award calculated by multiplying his or her annual base salary at the end of the year by the Target Percentage, then applying weighted achievement percentages for the Performance Objectives. Corporate Participants and Profit Center Participants have separate award calculations based on factors defined in the 2021 KOIP Award Formula as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1  

Perry E. Davis and Matthew C. Flanigan have retired from the Company. As such, neither will participate under the 2021 KOIP Award Formula.  

Corporate Participants. Karl G. Glassman (Chairman & CEO), J. Mitchell Dolloff (President & COO, President – Bedding Products), Jeffrey L. Tate (EVP & CFO) and Scott S. Douglas (SVP – General Counsel & Secretary) are Corporate Participants. Awards for Corporate Participants are determined by the Company’s aggregate 2021 financial results. No awards will be paid for ROCE achievement below 30.5% or Cash Flow below $375 million. The maximum payout percentage for ROCE and Cash Flow achievement is capped at 150%.  

3   

Below are the 2021 Corporate Targets and Payout Schedule. Payouts will be interpolated for achievement levels falling between those in the schedule. Financial results from acquisitions are excluded from the calculations in the year of acquisition. Financial results from divestitures will be included in the calculations; however, the ROCE and Cash Flow targets relating to the divested businesses will be prorated to reflect only that portion of the year prior to the divestiture. Financial results from businesses classified as discontinued operations will be included in the calculations. Financial results will exclude (i) certain currency and hedging-related gains and losses; (ii) gains and losses from asset disposals; and (iii) items that are outside the scope of the Company’s core, on-going businesses.  

ROCE and Cash Flow are adjusted for all items of gain, loss or expense for the fiscal year, as determined in accordance with standards established under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (i) from non-cash impairments; (ii) related to loss contingencies identified in footnotes to the financial statements in the Company’s 2020 10-K; (iii) related to the disposal of a segment of a business; or (iv) related to a change in accounting principle.

Corporate Targets and Payout Schedule  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Profit Center Participants. Steven K. Henderson (EVP, President – Specialized Products & Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products) is a Profit Center Participant. Achievement for ROCE and FCF targets for Profit Center Participants is determined by aggregate 2021 financial results for the profit centers for which the participant is responsible. For Profit Center Participants, no awards are paid for achievement below 75% of the ROCE and FCF targets. The ROCE and FCF payouts are each capped at 150%.  

Below are the 2021 Profit Center Targets and Profit Center Payout Schedule for Mr. Henderson. Payouts will be interpolated for achievement levels falling between those in the schedule. Financial results for each profit center may include a critical compliance adjustment, ranging from a potential 5% increase for exceptional safety performance to a 20% deduction for critical compliance failures. Financial results from acquisitions are excluded from the calculations in the year of acquisition. Financial results from divestitures will be included in the calculations; however, the ROCE and FCF targets relating to the divested businesses will be prorated to reflect only the portion of the year prior to the divestiture. Financial results from businesses classified as discontinued operations will be included in the calculations.  

Financial results will exclude (i) results from non-operating branches, (ii) certain currency and hedging-related gains and losses, (iii) gains and losses from asset disposals, (iv) items that are outside the scope of the Company’s core, on-going business activities or relating to any other special events or change in business conditions, and (v) the impact of corporate allocations.  

ROCE and FCF are adjusted for all items of gain, loss or expense for the fiscal year, as determined in accordance with standards established under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (i) from non-cash impairments; (ii) related to loss contingencies identified in footnotes to the financial statements in the Company’s 2020 10-K; (iii) related to the disposal of a segment of a business; or (iv) related to a change in accounting principle.

Setting of Long-Term Incentive Award Multiples for Named Executive Officers  

Except as noted below, equity-based long-term incentive (“LTI”) awards were granted to our named executive officers and other executives of the Company on February 23, 2021. Each named executive officer has an LTI award multiple (set by senior management and approved by the Committee), which was allocated between performance stock units (“PSUs”) making up 67% of the overall 2021 LTI award and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) making up 33% of the overall 2021 LTI award. The number of PSUs and RSUs granted to each executive was determined by multiplying the executive’s 2021 annual base salary by his or her respective LTI award multiple and dividing this amount by the average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the 10 trading days following the 2020 fourth quarter earnings release, which was $42.585 per share. Except as noted, below are the 2020 LTI award multiples set by the Committee on November 4, 2019, and the 2021 LTI award multiples set by the Committee on February 23, 2021, for our named executive officers:

As previously reported, Perry E. Davis, Former EVP, President – Residential Products & Industrial Products (SVP – Operations, effective 1/1/2020 through 2/7/2020) retired February 7, 2020. Also, as previously reported, Matthew C. Flanigan, former EVP & CFO retired December 31, 2019. As such, neither Mr. Davis nor Mr. Flanigan received LTI awards in 2020 or 2021.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The PSUs were granted pursuant to the Company’s 2021 Form of Performance Stock Unit Award Agreement, attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 10.5. The RSUs were granted pursuant to the Company’s 2021 Form of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 10.6  

Amendments to the Company’s Form of Performance Stock Unit Award Agreement and Form of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement  

On February 23, 2021, the Compensation Committee amended the Company’s Form of Performance Stock Unit Award Agreement (the “2021 Form of PSU Award”) and the Company’s Form of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the “2021 Form of RSU Award”). 

Both the 2021 Form of PSU Award and 2021 Form of RSU Award contain the definition of “retirement.” If the executive’s termination is due to retirement, his or her PSU award will vest at the end of the three-year PSU performance period and will be prorated for the number of days during the performance period prior to termination. If the executive’s termination is due to retirement, his or her RSU award will continue to vest on each vesting date (the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date of the RSU award). If the executive’s employment is terminated for a reason other than retirement (or death or disability), the PSU awards terminate immediately, and the executive’s right to receive the unvested shares under the RSU award will terminate immediately.  

Prior to the amendment, the previous PSU Form of Award and previous RSU Form of Award also contained non-competition and non-solicitation covenants that restrict the executive from competitive activities during employment and for two years after payout (for the PSU award) or each vesting date (for the RSU award) where, if violated, the executive must repay to the Company the gain from the applicable award (in addition to any other equitable remedies the Company may have).  

The Committee:

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Grant of Performance Stock Units under the Company’s 2021 Form of PSU Award  

On February 23, 2021, the Committee granted a base award of PSUs to each of our named executive officers. A percentage of the base award will vest at the end of the three-year performance period (the “Performance Period”) and will be paid out by March 15 of the following year, subject to the achievement of two performance objectives discussed below.  

6   

The PSUs were granted to our named executive officers in the amounts shown below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1   

Because of their respective retirements, neither Perry E. Davis nor Matthew C. Flanigan were granted PSUs.  

 2   

If Relative TSR and EBIT CAGR are achieved at their respective thresholds, the weighted average payout would be 50%.  

The 2021 Form of PSU Award provides that PSUs vest at the end of the Performance Period, based upon two performance objectives:  

Relative TSR: Fifty percent (50%) of each PSU award will vest based upon the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) compared to a peer group consisting of all the companies in the Industrial, Consumer Discretionary and Materials sectors of the S&P 500 and S&P 400. TSR is calculated as:  

(Ending Stock Price – Beginning Stock Price + Reinvested Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price  

The “Beginning Stock Price” is the average closing share price of the Company’s stock for the last 20 trading days prior to the Performance Period. The “Ending Stock Price” is the average closing share price of the Company’s stock for the last 20 trading days within the Performance Period.  

EBIT CAGR: Fifty percent (50%) of each PSU award will vest based upon the Company’s (for Glassman, Dolloff, Tate, and Douglas) or the Specialized Products and Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products Segments (for Henderson) compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (“EBIT”) during the third fiscal year of the Performance Period compared to the Company’s (or applicable segments’) EBIT in the fiscal year immediately preceding the Performance Period. The calculation of EBIT CAGR will include results from businesses acquired during the Performance Period and will exclude results for any businesses divested during the Performance Period. EBIT CAGR will exclude (i) results from non-operating branches, (ii) certain currency and hedging-related gains and losses, (iii) gains and losses from asset disposals, (iv) items that are outside the scope of the Company’s core, on-going business activities, and (v) with respect to segments, all amounts relating to corporate allocations. EBIT CAGR will be adjusted to eliminate gain, loss or expense, as determined in accordance with standards established under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (i) from non-cash impairments; (ii) related to loss contingencies identified in footnotes to the financial statements in the Company’s Form 10-K relating to the fiscal year immediately preceding the Performance Period; (iii) related to the disposal of a segment of a business; or (iv) related to a change in accounting principle.  

7   

The PSU vesting schedules for Relative TSR and EBIT CAGR are as follows, with payouts interpolated for results falling between the levels shown:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Notwithstanding the foregoing Relative TSR vesting schedule, in the event that the Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is negative (Ending Stock Price plus Reinvested Dividends is less than Beginning Stock Price), the Relative TSR vesting percentage will be capped at 100%.  

The PSUs normally vest on the last day of the Performance Period. Generally, if the executive has a separation from service, other than for retirement, death, or disability, before the PSUs vest, they are immediately forfeited. In the event of retirement, the award will vest at the end of the Performance Period and will be prorated for the number of days employed during the Performance Period prior to termination. However, in the case of termination due to death or disability, the award will vest immediately at 100% of the base award. Retirement is defined as a termination other than for cause occurring on or after age 65, or the combination of the executive’s age and years of service being greater than or equal to 70 years.  

Fifty percent (50%) of the vested PSU award will be paid out in cash, and the Company intends to pay out the remaining fifty percent (50%) in shares of Company common stock, although the Company reserves the right, subject to Committee approval, to pay up to one hundred percent (100%) in cash. The awards will be paid following the end of the Performance Period. Cash will be paid equal to the number of vested PSUs multiplied by the closing market price of Company common stock on the last business day of the Performance Period. Shares will be issued on a one-to-one basis for vested PSUs. Both the amount of cash paid and number of shares issued will be reduced for applicable tax withholding. PSUs may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered, and have no voting or dividend rights.  

Under certain circumstances, if a change in control of the Company occurs and the executive’s employment is terminated, the PSU award will vest and the executive will receive a 200% payout. Also, if within 24 months of payment, the Company is required to restate previously reported financial results, the executive must repay any amounts paid in excess of the amount that would have been paid based on the restated financials. Finally, the PSU awards contain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants during employment and generally for one year after payout.  

The PSU awards are granted under the Company’s Flexible Stock Plan, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2020, filed March 31, 2020 as an Appendix to the Company’s Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Flexible Stock Plan”), which is incorporated by reference herein as Exhibit 10.7. All future awards of PSUs to our named executive officers are expected to be made pursuant to the attached 2021 Form of PSU Award. If the terms and conditions of future grants are materially changed, the Company will make a subsequent filing of the updated form at that time.

Grant of Restricted Stock Units under the Company’s 2021 Form of RSU Award  

On February 23, 2021, the Committee granted RSUs under the 2021 Form of RSU Award to our named executive officers in the amounts shown below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1   

Because of their respective retirements, neither Perry E. Davis nor Matthew C. Flanigan were granted RSUs.  

The RSUs vest, provided that the executive remains employed with the Company, in one-third (1/3) increments on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date. Upon vesting, each RSU is converted into one share of Company common stock and distributed, subject to reduction for tax withholding.  

Generally, if the executive has a separation from service, before the RSUs vest, they are immediately forfeited. However, if the executive’s employment ends due to death or disability, or in certain circumstances due to a Change of Control of the Company, the awards will become 100% vested immediately. In addition, if termination is due to retirement on or after age 65, or the date at which the combination of the executive’s age and years of service is greater than or equal to 70 years, the executive will continue to receive shares that will vest after the retirement date.  

The RSUs may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered, and have no voting or dividend rights. Also, the RSUs contain a non-solicitation covenant for one year after each vesting date. All future awards of RSUs to our named executive officers are expected to be made pursuant to the attached 2021 Form of RSU Award. If the terms and conditions of future grants are materially changed, we will make a subsequent filing of the updated form at that time.  

Compensation Committee Approves 2018-2020 Business Unit Profit Sharing Cash Award for Mr. Henderson  

In 2018, Mr. Henderson accepted the 2018-2020 Business Unit Profit Sharing Award Agreement granted by the Company (the “2018 BUPS Agreement”), which is attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 10.8. The 2018 BUPS Agreement provides that Mr. Henderson will receive a cash payment equal to 1.50% of the incremental EBIT, subject to certain adjustments and limitations, produced by the business units under his direction during the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2020. On February 23, 2021 the Committee approved a payment of $51,282 to Mr. Henderson pursuant to the 2018 BUPS Agreement. The 2018 BUPS Agreement contains a two-year non-competition and non-solicitation covenant from the payout.  

Mr. Henderson is also eligible to receive a cash payment based substantially on the same terms under the 2019-2021 Business Unit Profit Sharing Award Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.9.

The foregoing is only a brief description and summary of the terms and conditions of the KOIP, the 2021 KOIP Award Formula, the 2021 Form of PSU Award, the 2021 Form of RSU Award, the 2018 BUPS Agreement, and the 2019-2021 Business Unit Profit Sharing Award Agreement and each is qualified in its entirety by reference to these documents which are attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  

 Item 5.03  

Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On February 24, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company, on recommendation of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, approved an amendment to, and restatement of, the Company’s Bylaws, to be effective the same day. Prior to the amendment, the Bylaws provided that annual and special shareholder meetings may be held on such dates, at such times, and at such places, either within or without the State of Missouri as determined by the Board of Directors. In addition to the existing language, the Bylaws have been amended to provide that annual and special meetings of shareholders may also be held by means of remote communication, or by both in person meeting and by remote communication. The Bylaws were also amended to provide that notices to shareholders regarding annual or special meetings shall provide for the means of remote communication, if any.  

The preceding summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bylaws, as amended through February 24, 2021. The Bylaws, as amended, and a copy of the Bylaws marked to show changes from the prior provisions, are included as Exhibit 3.2.1 and Exhibit 3.2.2, respectively, to this Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
