Fiscal 2021 Third-Quarter Result Summary

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“McKesson continued to demonstrate its operational excellence and extensive healthcare supply chain expertise, as we began the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine doses to the entire U.S. in the third quarter,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “McKesson’s long history of serving as the centralized distributor for the Vaccines for Children program for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including during the H1N1 public health crisis, positions us well to distribute hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccines safely and efficiently to the right location, in the right quantity, and in the right condition. Our COVID-19 vaccine distribution has been highly successful, achieving all volume and timing requirements by the government, and I want to thank our 80,000 employees around the world for their tremendous efforts and dedication.”

“While the overall environment remains challenging due to the sustained impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased to report third-quarter adjusted earnings results ahead of our expectations. McKesson’s performance reflects strong execution and the benefits from our ongoing strategic investments in the growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. Based on our year-to-date progress and the successful execution of distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies in the U.S., we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2021 and now expect Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $16.95 to $17.25.”

Third-quarter revenues were $62.6 billion, up 6% from a year ago, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to market growth and higher specialty volumes, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.

Third-quarter Loss per diluted share of $(39.03) included a pre-tax $8.1 billion expense accrual related to opioid litigation and a pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charge of $115 million primarily related to McKesson’s retail pharmacy businesses in the International segment. Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share does not include these charges.

Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $4.60 compared to $3.81 a year ago, an increase of 21%, driven by a lower share count and growth in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, partially offset by a higher tax rate and the lapping of the prior year contribution from the company's now separated investment in Change Healthcare LLC ("Change Healthcare"). Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share also included pre-tax net gains of approximately $30 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, associated with McKesson Ventures’ equity investments.

For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $709 million of cash to shareholders via $500 million of common stock repurchases and $209 million of dividend payments. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $1.2 billion, and invested $427 million internally, resulting in Free Cash Flow of $745 million. 

Opioid-related charges

•In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, McKesson recorded a GAAP-only pre-tax charge of $8.1 billion, $6.7 billion post-tax, related to the estimated liability for opioid-related claims of governmental entities. The Company is in ongoing, advanced discussions with state attorneys general and plaintiffs’ attorneys regarding a settlement framework under which the Company would pay its portion of a broad settlement over a period of 18 years. A loss in this amount has now been deemed probable and reasonably estimable.

U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment

•Third-quarter revenues were $49.5 billion, up 7%, driven by market growth and higher specialty volumes, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.

•Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $635 million and operating margin was 1.28%. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $656 million, up 2% from a year ago, driven by growth in specialty, partially offset by higher operating expenses in support of the company’s strategic growth initiatives. Adjusted operating margin was 1.33%, down 5 basis points.

International Segment

•Third-quarter revenues were $9.3 billion, down 6% on a reported basis and down 10% on an FX-Adjusted basis, driven by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance.

•Third-quarter Segment Operating Loss was $(71) million and operating margin was (0.77)%, driven by a GAAP-only pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charge of $115 million primarily related to McKesson’s retail pharmacy businesses in Canada and Europe. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $158 million, up 9%. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $150 million, up 3%. Adjusted operating margin was 1.70%, up 23 basis points. On an FX-Adjusted basis, adjusted operating margin was 1.69%, up 22 basis points.

Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment

•Third-quarter revenues were $3.1 billion, up 43%, primarily driven by demand for COVID-19 tests in the Primary Care and Extended Care businesses.

•Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $260 million and operating margin was 8.51%. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $279 million, up 52%, driven by demand for COVID-19 tests and the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by inventory charges. Adjusted operating margin was 9.14%, up 55 basis points. 

Prescription Technology Solutions Segment

•Third-quarter revenues were $777 million, up 9%, driven by new brand support programs and higher volumes of existing brand support programs.

•Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $114 million and operating margin was 14.67%. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $131 million, up 27%, reflecting organic growth in the segment. Adjusted operating margin was 16.86%, up from 14.43% in the prior year. 

Company Updates 

•McKesson launched Ontada, an oncology technology and insights business within the U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment, designed to support innovation, acceleration and evidence generation to drive better outcomes for cancer patients.

•McKesson’s Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase program, demonstrating confidence in McKesson’s diversified capital allocation strategy. 

Recent Sustainability and ESG Highlights

•Dr. Kelvin A. Baggett joined McKesson in the newly created role of chief impact officer effective November 30, 2020.

•McKesson issued its FY20 Corporate Responsibility report highlighting its strategy and action towards better health for people and the planet and has joined the United Nations Global Compact initiative, a voluntary leadership platform for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices. 

•For the eighth consecutive year, McKesson was recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality” by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation, achieving 100 percent on the HRC’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index. 

Fiscal 2021 Outlook

McKesson raised and narrowed fiscal 2021 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance to $16.95 to $17.25 from the previous range of $16.00 to $16.50 to primarily reflect improved growth in the business and the contribution from McKesson’s successful distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies. Fiscal 2021 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance assumes $0.25 to $0.35 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution and $0.20 to $0.30 related to the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines. 

Fiscal 2021 guidance continues to assume that a full recovery of pharmaceutical prescription volumes and patient visits will not occur this fiscal year. 

Other remaining businesses

As a result of the segment realignment effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Other reflects equity earnings and charges for retrospective periods for the company's previous investment in Change Healthcare, which was separated from the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Equity Income from Change Healthcare, Adjusted Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.

Cautionary Statements 

Except for historical information contained in this press release, matters discussed may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in those statements. It is not possible to identify all such risks and uncertainties. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as financial performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “plans”, “estimates” or the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial trends, strategy, plans, assumptions or intentions may also include forward-looking statements. We encourage investors to read the important risk factors described in the company’s Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

These risk factors include, but are not limited to: we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes, including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might experience losses not covered by insurance; we from time to time record significant charges from impairment to goodwill, intangibles and other assets or investments; we experience cybersecurity incidents and might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches; we might experience significant problems with information systems or networks; we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy profitability; we might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-renewal; our contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks; we might be harmed by changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models; we might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply and we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and changes in pricing due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains; we might be adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely impacted by an economic slowdown (including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic) or recession and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access credit, increase our borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues (including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events and other catastrophic events; and we face uncertainties and risks related to vaccination distribution programs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.

(b)We calculate loss per diluted common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation (GAAP) for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended December 31, 2019 using a weighted average of 159.5 million, 161.2 million, and 183.1 million common shares, respectively, which excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effect when calculating a net loss per diluted share. We calculate adjusted earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended December 31, 2019 on a fully diluted basis, using a weighted average of 161.0 million, 162.5 million, and 184.0 million common shares, respectively. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a fully diluted basis, any footing differences in those items are due to different weighted average share counts. This methodology results in per share differences of $0.36, $0.26, and $0.01 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively.

(c)Adjusted earnings per diluted share on an FX-adjusted basis for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 was $4.58 and $12.15, respectively, which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.02 in both periods.

(1)Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles includes our proportionate share of loss from investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture within Other.

This charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables. In prior periods, this charge was included under other adjustments, net. 

(8)Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 includes pre-tax charges of $122 million ($90 million after-tax) representing settlement charges related to our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan, within Corporate expenses, net. This charge is included under "other income (expense), net" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(9)Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 includes a pre-tax charge of $1.2 billion ($864 million after-tax) representing an other-than-temporary impairment of McKesson’s investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture within Other.

(10)Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $69 million (pre-tax and after-tax) within International related to our European retail business, partially offset by the related indirect effect of $4 million benefit in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

(11)Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of $50 million ($37 million after-tax) related to our estimated liability under the New York ("NY") state Opioid Stewardship Act ("OSA") within U.S. Pharmaceutical for calendar years 2017 and 2018. In December 2018, a federal district court struck down the law as unconstitutional and NY replaced the OSA with an excise tax on opioid sales in the state of NY covering calendar year 2019 sales and beyond. In September 2020, an appellate court reversed on procedural grounds the district court’s decision. An amendment to the Act made clear that the OSA applies only to NY opioid sales or distributions for calendar years 2017 and 2018. To the extent that further court decisions do not strike down the law, we will face liability under the OSA and we believe the estimated OSA liability is one-time in nature because the liability is retroactively imposed on sales or distributions in 2017 and 2018, and is not indicative of future results. Inclusion of this accrual in our adjusted results would distort current period performance. This charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

Restructuring, impairment, and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from adjusted results.

Claims and litigation charges - Adjustments to certain of the Company’s reserves, including those related to estimated probable settlements for its controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred.

Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

Additionally, the Company's investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture's financial results are adjusted for the above noted items, except for the effect of potentially dilutive securities issued by the joint venture on our adjusted results per diluted share.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share on an FX-Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less payments for property, plant and equipment and capitalized software expenditures, as disclosed in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Management utilizes Non-GAAP financial measures when allocating resources, deploying capital, as well as assessing business performance, and determining employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP adjusted results and related Non-GAAP measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
