First quarter sales of $2.4 billion increased five percent on three percent favorable currency, two percent higher pricing and one percent higher energy pass-through. Volumes declined one percent, as new plants, acquisitions and increased sale-of-equipment activities were offset by lower demand from COVID-19 and a reduced contribution from the Lu'An gasification project in Asia ("Lu'An").

Commenting on the results, Air Products' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Seifi Ghasemi said, "The resilient, hard-working and focused Air Products team delivered higher adjusted EBITDA this quarter—as well as maintained adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 40 percent—despite the continued challenges of the global pandemic. From our position of financial strength, we continued to execute our growth strategy focused on industrial gas projects that address significant energy and environmental challenges. Meanwhile, we continue to create shareholder value through the dividend, with our latest 12 percent increase representing our 39th consecutive year of dividend payment increases.” 

Fiscal First Quarter Results by Business Segment 

•Industrial Gases - Americas sales of $933 million were flat versus the prior year. Three percent higher pricing and two percent higher energy pass-through were offset by five percent lower volumes, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. Operating income of $226 million decreased 12 percent, due to lower volumes and higher planned maintenance, partially offset by higher pricing. Operating margin of 24.2 percent decreased 330 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million decreased two percent, due to lower volumes and higher planned maintenance, partially offset by higher pricing and the acquisition of hydrogen assets. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 42.9 percent decreased 90 basis points.

Sequentially, sales increased two percent on five percent higher energy pass-through and one percent higher pricing, partially offset by four percent lower volumes, primarily driven by seasonality. 

•Industrial Gases - EMEA sales of $563 million increased 13 percent over the prior year. Volumes increased five percent, primarily driven by acquisitions and higher onsite volumes, partially offset by lower packaged gas demand from COVID-19. Three percent higher pricing and six percent favorable currency more than offset one percent lower energy pass-through. Operating income of $142 million increased 17 percent, primarily due to higher pricing, favorable currency and acquisitions, and operating margin of 25.1 percent increased 90 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA of $222 million increased 18 percent, primarily due to higher pricing, favorable currency and acquisitions, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 39.4 percent increased 170 basis points. 

Sequentially, sales increased 11 percent on six percent higher volumes, driven by modest COVID-19-related recovery in the merchant business, acquisitions and higher onsite volumes; two percent favorable currency; two percent higher energy cost pass-through; and one percent higher pricing.

•Industrial Gases - Asia sales of $718 million increased four percent from the prior year on six percent favorable currency and one percent each higher pricing and energy-pass through.

Adjusted EBITDA of $343 million decreased one percent, primarily due to Lu'An, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 47.7 percent decreased 240 basis points. 

Sequentially, sales increased one percent, as four percent favorable currency more than offset three percent lower volumes, including Lu'An.

Ghasemi added, "Despite continued, broad economic uncertainty in most of the world, we remain confident in the profitable growth strategy we are executing, providing innovative solutions for some of the world’s most significant energy and environmental challenges. With our strong portfolio, we are able to meet customers' and countries' drive for cleaner and more sustainable solutions. We see great opportunities ahead in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen for mobility, and we continue to develop and invest in strategic opportunities to drive our growth for decades to come. I continue to be as optimistic as ever about the future of Air Products.” 

Discontinued Operations

During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, Air Products recorded net income from discontinued operations of $10.3 million ($0.05 per share), primarily from the settlement of a state tax appeal related to the gain on the sale of the former Performance Materials Division in fiscal year 2017. This settlement did not have an impact on Air Products' statement of cash flows in the first quarter.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

(Millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for per share data)

We present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), on an "adjusted" or "non-GAAP" basis. On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted effective tax rate. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or "non-GAAP adjustments," have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of our business because such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. 

In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. 

When applicable, the tax impact on our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.

ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS

There were no non-GAAP adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 or 2020 that impacted diluted EPS from continuing operations.

When applicable, the table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance.

ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN

We define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance. Margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding. 

The tables below present consolidated sales and a reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to adjusted EBITDA and net income margin on a GAAP basis to adjusted EBITDA margin:

ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. There were no non-GAAP adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 or 2020 that impacted our effective tax rate.

When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense associated with each adjustment and is primarily dependent upon the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.
