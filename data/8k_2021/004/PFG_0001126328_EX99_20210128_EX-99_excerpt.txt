Segment Results

 ·Net revenue decreased $7.4 million as the benefits of higher equity markets and higher variable investment income were more than offset by the impact of the reduction in interest on excess reserve (IOER) rate. 

Retirement and Income Solutions - Spread 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ·Pre-tax operating earnings increased $58.4 million due to higher net revenue and expense management. 

 ·Net revenue increased $56.3 million due to growth in the business, higher variable investment income and more favorable reserve gains. 

4Pre-tax operating earnings = operating earnings before income taxes and after noncontrolling interest. 

5 Net revenue = operating revenues less benefits, claims and settlement expenses less dividends to policyholders. 

6 Pre-tax return on net revenue = pre-tax operating earnings divided by net revenue. 

Principal Global Investors 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ·Pre-tax operating earnings increased $7.9 million primarily due to growth in management fees and disciplined expense management. Prior year quarter benefited $12.1 million from an earnout liability reduction. 

 ·Operating revenues less pass-through expenses decreased $10.6 million as growth in management fees was offset by lower performance fees. 

Principal International 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ·Pre-tax operating earnings decreased $17.9 million due to lower combined net revenue (at PFG share). 

 ·Combined net revenue (at PFG share) decreased $24.7 million due to unfavorable impacts from inflation in Brazil and foreign currency translation, partially offset by improved encaje performance. 

7The company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures at the end of the release. The company has determined this measure is more representative of underlying operating revenues growth for PGI as it removes commissions and other expenses that are collected through fee revenue and passed through expenses with no impact to pre-tax operating earnings. 

8 Pre-tax return on operating revenues less pass-through expenses = pre-tax operating earnings, adjusted for noncontrolling interest divided by operating revenues less pass-through expenses. 

9 Combined net revenue (a non-GAAP financial measure): net revenue for all PI companies at 100% less pass-through commissions. The company has determined combined net revenue (at PFG share) is more representative of underlying net revenue growth for PI as it reflects our proportionate share of consolidated and equity method subsidiaries. In addition, using this net revenue metric provides a more meaningful representation of our profit margins.

Use of Non-GAAP financial measures 

The company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company’s financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.

Summary of Principal Financial Group, Inc. and Segment Results 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

*U.S. GAAP (GAAP) net income attributable to PFG versus non-GAAP operating earnings 

Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings, which is a financial measure that excludes the effect of net realized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments the company believes are not indicative of overall operating trends, for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts. Note: it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of non-GAAP operating earnings enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the company’s businesses.
