“We are pleased with our performance in 2020, especially in light of the uncertain economic environment caused by the pandemic,” said Jack Barnes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Full year financial and operating results were strong and reflect the resilience of People’s United, its employees and customers. Pre-provision net revenue of $827 million, on an operating basis, increased 12 percent from the prior year, reflecting the success of recent acquisitions and solid execution across core operations. Higher revenues and continued emphasis on controlling costs lowered the efficiency ratio 160 basis points to 54.2 percent, marking the seventh consecutive year of improvement. Asset quality remained excellent, indicative of the Company’s conservative approach to underwriting, diversified loan portfolio, and deep customer relationships. We are particularly pleased by the continued reduction in loan deferrals, which ended the year at $271 million or 0.6 percent of total loans, down from $1.6 billion or 3.5 percent of total loans at the close of the third quarter.”   

Barnes continued, “As consumer preferences evolve to more digitally-driven experiences, we have continually enhanced our technology capabilities to deliver value, provide convenience and create efficiencies. As a result, customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms for their banking needs. Given these accelerating digital banking trends and shifts in retail shopping behavior, we announced today the decision not to renew our existing in-store branch contracts with Stop & Shop in Connecticut and New York upon expiration in 2022. This decision enables us to further optimize our branch network, while providing the same level of personalized service across each of our channels.”  

“We concluded the year with a solid financial performance in the fourth quarter,” stated David Rosato, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Operating earnings of $147.7 million increased two percent linked-quarter and benefited from a lower provision, higher fee income and well-controlled expenses. Net interest margin of 2.84 percent was 13 basis points lower than the third quarter, primarily due to increased excess liquidity and lower yields in both the loan and securities portfolios. These headwinds were partially offset by our continued discipline managing deposit pricing as costs declined for the sixth consecutive quarter. The loan-to-deposit ratio at quarter-end was 84 percent as loans decreased nearly $1.4 billion or three percent from September 30, while deposits grew $2.5 billion or five percent. The decline in period-end loans was primarily driven by $715 million in lower retail balances, $289 million in forgiven PPP loans, and a combined $107 million reduction in our runoff portfolios. Conversely, we continued to achieve strong growth in our mortgage warehouse and LEAF businesses. Period-end deposit growth reflected a $1.8 billion increase in non-interest bearing balances, partially offset by the roll-off of higher cost time deposits.”

The Board of Directors declared a $0.18 per common share quarterly dividend payable February 15, 2021 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2021. Based on the closing stock price on January 20, 2021, the dividend yield on People’s United Financial common stock is 5.0 percent.

The Company is currently in the process of performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment. Additional time is necessary to complete the analysis given the complexities brought about by the macroeconomic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly the current and projected low interest rate environment and a decline in bank stock valuations last fall, including on the date of the Company’s annual assessment (October 1st). Any potential goodwill impairment charge could be material to reported earnings, but would represent a non-cash charge and have no effect on the Company’s cash balances, liquidity or tangible equity. In addition, because goodwill and other intangible assets are not included in the calculation of regulatory capital, the Company’s well-capitalized regulatory capital ratios would not be affected by this potential non-cash expense. The analysis will be completed prior to filing the Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP  

In addition to evaluating People’s United Financial Inc. (“People’s United”) results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible common equity ratios, tangible book value per common share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People’s United’s underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are used to analyze the relative strength of People’s United’s capital position.  

The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People’s United to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding operating lease expense, goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income, the netting of operating lease expense and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans and acquired loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People’s United generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.  

Operating earnings exclude from net income available to common shareholders those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People’s United’s results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to: (i) non-recurring gains/losses; (ii) merger-related expenses, including acquisition integration and other costs; (iii) writedowns of banking house assets and related lease termination costs; (iv) severance-related costs; and (v) charges related to executive-level management separation costs, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per common share (“EPS”) is derived by determining the per common share impact of the respective adjustments to arrive at operating earnings and adding (subtracting) such amounts to (from) diluted EPS, as reported. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average total assets. Operating return on average tangible common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible common equity. The operating common dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing common dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.  

Pre-provision net revenue is a useful financial measure as it enables an assessment of the Company’s ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle as well as providing an additional basis for comparing the Company’s results of operation between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods.  

The tangible common equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible common equity (total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the denominator). Tangible book value per common share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) common shares).  

In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People’s United for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.
