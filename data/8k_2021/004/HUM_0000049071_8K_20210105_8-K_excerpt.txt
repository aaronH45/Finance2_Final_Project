Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 

Members of Humana Inc.’s (the “Company”) senior management team are scheduled to meet with investors and analysts at industry conferences between January 5, 2021 and January 11, 2021. The date and time of these presentations to investors are available via the Investor Relations calendar of events on Humana’s web site at www.humana.com, and the Company’s presentations during the conferences are expected to be webcast. 

During the conferences, the Company intends to address its prospects and performance and intends to reaffirm its guidance range of $24.70 to $24.95 in diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”), or a range of $18.50 to $18.75 in adjusted earnings per common share (“Adjusted EPS”), in each case for the year ending December 31, 2020 (“FY 2020”). FY 2020 EPS guidance reflects fourth quarter 2020 losses of approximately $2.55 EPS, or approximately $2.40 in Adjusted EPS. This guidance is consistent with the guidance issued in Humana’s press release dated November 3, 2020 and reaffirmed on December 1, 2020. 

The Company has included Adjusted EPS in this current report, a financial measure that is not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Management believes that this measure, when presented in conjunction with the comparable measure of GAAP EPS, is useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the Company’s ongoing business and operating performance. Consequently, management uses Adjusted EPS as an indicator of the Company’s business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP EPS. A reconciliation of GAAP EPS to Adjusted EPS follows:

The Company plans to host a conference call and announce its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020, as well as provide detailed financial guidance for the year ended December 31, 2021, on Wednesday, February 3, 2021.
