(a)The table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “Return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.

(b)12/31/20 ratio is estimated.

TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

TE = Taxable Equivalent

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1.043 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $987 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances and loan fees, partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin was impacted by lower interest rates and a change in balance sheet mix, including elevated levels of liquidity and Key's participation in the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"). 

Compared to the third quarter of 2020, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $37 million and the net interest margin increased by 8 basis points. The increase in both net interest income and the net interest margin reflects lower interest-bearing deposit costs and higher loan fees related to PPP, partly offset by elevated levels of liquidity.

 Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, noninterest income increased by $151 million, primarily driven by a $62 million increase in investment banking and debt placement fees. The record fourth quarter of 2020 for investment banking and debt placement fees was largely related to strong M&A activity. Cards and payments income increased $30 million from the year-ago period, driven by higher prepaid card activity. Additionally, investments made in Key's mortgage business continue to drive consumer mortgage income and commercial mortgage servicing fees, which increased $22 million and $13 million, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. 

Compared to the third quarter of 2020, noninterest income increased by $121 million. The largest driver of the quarter-over-quarter increase was a $97 million increase in investment banking and debt placement fees, largely driven by strong M&A activity and higher loan syndication. Commercial mortgage servicing fees were also strong, up $14 million compared to prior quarter and corporate services income increased $12 million, primarily driven by higher derivatives income. Partially offsetting these increases were a $17 million decrease in cards and payments income related to lower prepaid card activity and a $8 million decrease in consumer mortgage income. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Key’s noninterest expense was $1.128 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $148 million from the year-ago period. The increase is primarily related to higher personnel costs of $110 million, reflecting higher production-related incentives and higher salaries due to merit increases. Other drivers for the year-over-year increases include payments-related expenses from prepaid card activity incurred in the current period, as well as COVID-19-related costs related to steps that Key has taken to ensure the health and safety of teammates. 

 Compared to the third quarter of 2020, noninterest expense increased $91 million. The increase was largely due to incentive-related costs following a strong quarter for investment banking revenue, higher severance, as well as higher related stock-based compensation which drove the increase in personnel costs quarter-over-quarter. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Commercial and industrial average loan balances include $129 million, $129 million, and $146 million of assets from commercial credit cards at December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.

Average loans were $101.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $8.1 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Commercial loans increased $5.1 billion, reflecting Key’s participation in the PPP, partially offset by decreased utilization versus the year-ago period. Consumer loans increased $3.0 billion, driven by strength from Laurel Road and Key's consumer mortgage business.

KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2020 Profit 

January 21, 2021

Compared to the third quarter of 2020, average loans decreased by $3.2 billion. Commercial loans declined as clients paid down elevated line draws from earlier in the year. Consumer loans continue to reflect strength from Laurel Road, as well as Key's consumer mortgage business.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

N/A = Not Applicable

 Average deposits totaled $135.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $23.1 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting growth from consumer and commercial relationships, partially offset by a decline in time deposits as a result of lower interest rates.

Compared to the third quarter of 2020, average deposits increased by $777 million, primarily driven by broad-based commercial growth and higher consumer balances. This growth was offset by a continued decline in time deposits.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Key’s provision for credit losses was $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $109 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 and $160 million for the third quarter of 2020. The provision for credit losses reflects the adoption of the accounting standard, often referred to as Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL"), beginning in the first quarter of 2020. This framework requires that management estimate credit losses over the full remaining expected life and consider expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. 

 Net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $135 million, or .53% of average total loans. These results compare to $99 million, or .42%, for the fourth quarter of 2019 and $128 million, or .49%, for the third quarter of 2020. Key’s allowance for credit losses was $1.8 billion, or 1.80% of total period-end loans at December 31, 2020, compared to 1.02% at December 31, 2019, and 1.88% at September 30, 2020. 

 At December 31, 2020, Key’s nonperforming loans totaled $785 million, which represented .78% of period-end portfolio loans. These results compare to .61% at December 31, 2019, and .81% at September 30, 2020. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2020, totaled $937 million, and represented .92% of period-end

portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets. These results compare to .75% at December 31, 2019, and .97% at September 30, 2020.

CAPITAL

Key’s estimated risk-based capital ratios included in the following table continued to exceed all “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)12/31/2020 ratio is estimated and reflects Key's election to adopt the CECL optional transition provision.

(b)The table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons. 

Key's capital position remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2020. As shown in the preceding table, at December 31, 2020, Key’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 9.8% and 11.1%, respectively. Key's tangible common equity ratio was 7.9% at December 31, 2020. 

 Key has elected the CECL phase-in option provided by regulatory guidance which delays for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital and phases it in over three years beginning in 2022. On a fully phased-in basis, Key's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio would be reduced by 29 basis points.

(a)Other includes other segments that consists of corporate treasury, our principal investing unit, and various exit portfolios as well as reconciling items which primarily represents the unallocated portion of nonearning assets of corporate support functions. Charges related to the funding of these assets are part of net interest income and are allocated to the business segments through noninterest expense. Reconciling items also includes intercompany eliminations and certain items that are not allocated to the business segments because they do not reflect their normal operations.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(dollars in millions)

The table below presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “pre-provision net revenue," and “cash efficiency ratio" and certain ratios excluding notable items.

Notable items include certain revenue or expense items that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance. Management believes it is useful to consider certain financial metrics with and without notable items, in order to enable a better understanding of company results, increase comparability of period-to-period results, and to evaluate and forecast those results.

The tangible common equity ratio and the return on average tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock.

The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze the results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.

The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. As such, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of Key’s intangible asset amortization from the calculation. Management believes this ratio provide greater consistency and comparability between Key’s results and those of its peer banks. Additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
