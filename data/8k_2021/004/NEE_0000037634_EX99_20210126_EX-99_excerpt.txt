FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NextEra Energy reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 financial results

•NextEra Energy delivers strong full-year financial and operational results

•Florida Power & Light Company's smart capital investments further enhance its already-best-in-class value proposition

JUNO BEACH, Fla. - NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported 2020 fourth-quarter net losses attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $5 million, or $0.00 per share, compared to net income attributable to NextEra Energy of $975 million, or $0.50 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's 2020 fourth-quarter earnings were $785 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to $706 million, or $0.36 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2019. All share-based data has been adjusted to reflect NextEra Energy's Oct. 26, 2020, four-for-one stock split.

For the full year 2020, NextEra Energy reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP

basis of $2.919 billion, or $1.48 per share, compared to $3.769 billion, or $1.94 per share, in 2019. On

an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's full-year 2020 earnings were $4.552 billion, or $2.31 per share,

compared to $4.062 billion, or $2.09 per share, in 2019, which represents year-over-year growth in

adjusted earnings per share of approximately 10.5%.

Adjusted earnings for these periods exclude the effects of non-qualifying hedges; NextEra Energy Partners, LP net investment gains; gain on disposal of a business; differential membership interests-related; change in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds and other than temporary impairments (OTTI); operating results from the Spain solar projects; acquisition-related expenses; and an impairment charge.

NextEra Energy's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy's management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy's fundamental earnings power. A reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income attributable to NextEra Energy, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is included in the attachments to this news release.

"NextEra Energy's performance in 2020 was strong both financially and operationally, and we successfully executed on our initiatives, including the deployment of more than $14 billion in capital as we lead America's clean energy transformation," said Jim Robo, chairman and chief executive officer of NextEra Energy. "We achieved approximately 10.5% growth in adjusted earnings per share year-over-year and delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 30%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index. We delivered this terrific performance while continuing to manage the ongoing effects of the pandemic and navigating an unprecedented hurricane season. 

"In 2020, both FPL and Gulf Power continued to execute to further improve their customer value propositions. As a result, FPL's typical residential customer electric bills are the lowest in the nation when compared to the 20 largest investor-owned utilities in the country, and FPL was recognized for the fifth time in six years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. At Gulf Power Company, we extended our track record of terrific execution and, in the two years since we closed the acquisition, have already realized a nearly 30% reduction in operations and maintenance costs, an approximately 50% improvement in service reliability and a 93% improvement in safety, as we progress toward the long-term objectives we previously laid out. Earlier this month, FPL notified the Florida Public Service Commission that it expects to file a formal request in the coming months for a proposed four-year rate plan beginning in 2022 that will help us continue delivering unmatched value to customers by ushering in an even more resilient and sustainable energy future for Florida and keeping bills among the lowest in America. 

"In 2020, NextEra Energy Resources continued to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects, more than doubling the amount of total renewables megawatts commissioned versus the previous year, and executing on the largest construction program in our history on schedule and on budget. Additionally, NextEra Energy Resources continued to capitalize on the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry, adding a record net nearly 7,000 megawatts to our backlog. We now believe we will construct approximately 23 to 30 gigawatts of new renewables in the 2021 to 2024 timeframe, which, if we are successful, at the midpoint would mean adding a portfolio of generation projects that is approximately one-and-a-half times the size of NextEra Energy Resources' entire operating renewables portfolio as of year-end 2019. We remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's long-term growth prospects. Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. We remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years."

Florida Power & Light Company

FPL, which now serves more than 5.6 million customer accounts supporting more than 11 million residents across Florida and is the largest rate-regulated electric utility in the U.S. as measured by retail electricity produced and sold, reported fourth-quarter 2020 net income of $502 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to $400 million, or $0.20 per share, for the prior-year quarter. For the full year 2020, FPL reported net income on a GAAP basis of $2.65 billion, or $1.35 per share, compared to $2.334 billion, or $1.20 per share, in 2019. All financial results for FPL as of Dec. 31, 2020, exclude financial results attributable to Gulf Power. 

FPL's full-year growth was primarily driven by continued investment in the business. FPL's capital

expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing its full-year capital

investments to a total of roughly $6.7 billion. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately

11% for 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, FPL's average number of customers increased by

approximately 76,000 from the prior-year comparable quarter.

During 2020, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing more than 1,100 megawatts (MW) of cost-effective solar in service on time and on budget in support of its ongoing capital plan. This solar expansion is part of FPL's SolarTogether community solar program and groundbreaking "30-by-30" plan, which is one of the world's largest solar expansions and would result in roughly 10,000 

2

MW of total solar capacity on FPL's system by 2030. Additionally, the 409-MW Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will be the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, remains on track and on budget to be placed in service later this year.

As it has from the moment COVID-19 became widespread in March 2020, FPL remains committed to supporting customers experiencing hardship due to the pandemic and the resulting economic uncertainty. To date, FPL has provided customers approximately $75 million in relief through various programs and initiatives. As Florida recovers, FPL will continue to assist customers who need it most.

Earlier this month, FPL notified the Florida Public Service Commission that it expects to file a formal request in the coming months for new base rates. The company intends to propose a four-year rate plan that would begin in January 2022, following the one-year extension of its base rate freeze under FPL's current settlement agreement. While the proposal is still being finalized, FPL expects to request base rate adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion, starting January 2022, and $615 million, starting January 2023. 

Gulf Power Company

Gulf Power reported fourth-quarter 2020 net income of $53 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to $23 million, or $0.01 per share, for the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, Gulf Power's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings were $53 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to $26 million, or $0.01 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year 2020, Gulf Power reported net income on a GAAP basis of $238 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to $180 million, or $0.09 per share, in 2019. On an adjusted basis, Gulf Power's earnings for the full year 2020 were $238 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to $200 million, or $0.10 per share, in 2019.

On Jan. 1, 2021, Gulf Power legally merged into FPL. Gulf Power will continue as a separate operating division during 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, Gulf Power completed the Plant Crist coal-to-natural gas conversion and associated natural gas lateral, supporting the accelerated shut down of Plant Crist's coal units. With the retirement of FPL's Indiantown Cogeneration facility also occurring late last year, 2021 is the first time in nearly 70 years that there are no coal-fired power plants in Florida for either FPL or Gulf Power. Last year, Gulf Power's first solar development project, the roughly 75-MW Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center, went into service and is expected to generate significant customer savings over its lifetime. 

NextEra Energy Resources 

NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive clean energy business of NextEra Energy, reported a fourth-quarter 2020 net loss attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $644 million, or $0.33 per share, compared to a contribution to net income attributable to NextEra Energy of $433 million, or $0.22 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources' earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $342 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to $326 million, or $0.17 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2019.

For the full year 2020, NextEra Energy Resources reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $531 million, or $0.27 per share, compared to $1.807 billion, or $0.93 per share, in 2019. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources' earnings for the full year 2020 were $1.953 billion, or $0.99 per share, compared to $1.695 billion, or $0.87 per share, for the full year 2019.

In 2020, NextEra Energy Resources continued to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects, commissioning approximately 5,750 MW of wind, solar and storage projects, including approximately 570 MW of build-own-transfer projects not included in its backlog. Since the third-quarter 2020 financial results call, NextEra Energy Resources has added approximately 2,000 MW of renewables projects to its backlog, including approximately 1,030 MW of new wind and wind repowerings, 670 MW of solar and 300 MW of battery storage, including 75 additional MW of capacity on Desert Peak Storage, which is the largest standalone storage project in the world.

NextEra Energy Resources' fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 adjusted results exclude a charge associated with its investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline. Due to the current legal and regulatory challenges involved with the pipeline investment, as well as the substantial delays in reaching commercial operation and increased costs associated with those delays, the business is writing down the value of its investment in the pipeline by $1.2 billion on an after-tax basis. NextEra Energy Resources intends to continue to pursue completing the project with its partners.

Corporate and Other

In the fourth quarter of 2020 on a GAAP basis, Corporate and Other earnings decreased $0.02 per share, compared to the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, Corporate and Other earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased $0.03 per share, compared to the prior-year quarter. For the full year 2020, Corporate and Other earnings increased $0.02 per share on a GAAP basis, compared to 2019. On an adjusted basis, Corporate and Other earnings for the full year 2020 decreased $0.07 per share, compared to 2019. 

Outlook 

NextEra Energy's long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. For 2022 and 2023, this translates to an adjusted earnings per share range of $2.55 to $2.75 and $2.77 to $2.97, respectively.

NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards; the effects of non-qualifying hedges and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds and OTTI, none of which can be determined at this time. Adjusted earnings expectations also exclude the effects of NextEra Energy Partners, LP net investment gains; gains on disposal of a business; differential membership interests-related; acquisition-related expenses; and an impairment charge. In addition, adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions; supportive commodity markets; current forward curves; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no divestitures other than to NextEra Energy Partners, LP or acquisitions; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental tax policy or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.
