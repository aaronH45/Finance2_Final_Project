Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.  

On February 11, 2021, Becton Dickinson and Company (the “Company” or “BD”) issued $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.957% Notes due February 11, 2031 (the “Notes”) in an underwritten public offering pursuant to the indenture, dated March 1, 1997, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Indenture”). 

The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, (A) at any time prior to November 11, 2030, at the applicable “make-whole” redemption price described in the Indenture and the Notes, and (B) at any time on or after November 11, 2030, at 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed. In each case, the redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. 

If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Notes) occurs with respect to the Notes, unless the Company has executed its right to redeem such Notes as described above, the Company will be required to make an offer to each holder of outstanding Notes to repurchase all or any portion of that holder’s Notes (in integral multiples of $1,000) at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of such Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. 

Each of the following constitutes an event of default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes: (1) failure to pay any installment of interest on any security of such series when due and payable, continued for 30 days; (2) failure to pay the principal when due of such series, whether at its stated maturity or otherwise; (3) failure to observe or perform any other covenants, conditions or agreements of the Company with respect to such securities for 60 days after the Company receives notice of such failure; or (4) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. If an event of default occurs, the principal amount of the Notes may be accelerated pursuant to the Indenture. 

The Indenture includes requirements that must be met if the Company consolidates or merges with, or sells all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to, another entity. 

The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Indenture, a copy of which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 4(a) to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 31, 1997, and the Notes, the form of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. 

 The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay the entire $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 3.125% Notes due 2021 (the “3.125 Notes”), and to pay accrued interest, related premiums, fees and expenses in connection therewith.

Item 8.01. Other Events. 

On February 11, 2021, the Company caused to be delivered to the holders of the 3.125% Notes a notice of full redemption with respect to the entire $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Notes. The 3.125% Notes are expected to be fully redeemed on March 13, 2021 (the “Redemption Date”) at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of such 3.125% Notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the 3.125% Notes, discounted to the Redemption Date by the treasury rate less a discount in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 3.125% Notes, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date on the principal balance of the 3.125% Notes. 

The foregoing does not constitute a notice of redemption with respect ot the 3.125% notes.
