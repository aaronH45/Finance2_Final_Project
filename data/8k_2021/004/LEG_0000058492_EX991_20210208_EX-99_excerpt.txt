Chairman and CEO Karl Glassman commented, “We are pleased to have delivered a strong fourth quarter to end a very challenging 2020. Fourth quarter sales, EBIT, EBIT margin, and earnings per share increased versus the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, we generated strong operating cash flow, reduced debt levels, maintained significant liquidity, and increased the dividend for the 49th consecutive year.  

“I would like to thank our employees for their dedication, ingenuity, and tenacity in what was a very challenging year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our teams across our corporate functions and businesses came together to find solutions and navigate the many issues that resulted from the global pandemic. I am extremely proud of all they accomplished. We finished 2020 as a stronger company as a result of their extraordinary efforts.  

“We expect continued recovery into 2021 as a result of strong consumer demand for home-related items and global automotive, and modest improvement in our businesses in industries that are experiencing ongoing impacts from COVID-19. We also expect continued supply chain constraints, inflation in commodity costs, and recovery of those higher costs through selling price increases.”
