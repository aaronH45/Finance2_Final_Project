 ITEM 8.01. Other Events.  

In December 2020, SL Green Realty Corp. (“SLG”) announced a dividend payable on January 15, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 15, 2020 (the “Record Date”). As a result of the elections shareholders were entitled to make with respect to cash or stock (including deemed elections) in connection with such dividend, the cash option was oversubscribed and will be prorated. Shareholders who elected to receive cash will receive, for each share of common stock they owned as of the Record Date, approximately $0.3735 in cash and 0.0279 shares of common stock. Shareholders who elected to receive shares will receive, for each share of common stock they owned as of the Record Date, approximately 0.0343 shares of common stock. The number of shares to be issued was calculated based on the volume weighted average trading price of SLG’s common stock between January 5-7, 2021, of $58.15 per share. 

In the dividend announcement, the board of directors (the "Board") of SLG also authorized a reverse stock split. On January 8, 2021, a committee of the Board calculated the ratio for the reverse stock split of SLG’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock as 1.02918-for-1. 

The reverse stock split will become effective after markets close on January 20, 2021. SLG’s common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on the New York Stock Exchange as of the opening of trading on January 21, 2021, under SLG’s existing symbol “SLG.” SLG’s common stock has been assigned a new CUSIP number of 78440X804 in connection with the reverse stock split, effective January 21, 2021. 

Immediately after the reverse stock split becomes effective, every 1.02918 shares of SLG’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock will be combined into one share, and the par value per share will remain at $0.01. Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares so that shareholders receive a whole number of shares of SLG’s common stock. The cash payment will be based upon the closing price per share of SLG’s common stock on January 20, 2021. 

After the issuance of the dividend and the completion of the reverse stock split, the number of shares of SLG’s common stock outstanding is expected to be the same as the number of total shares outstanding on the Record Date (not including any issuances or repurchases that may occur following the Record Date, as well as any fractional shares that would have been issued but for which cash-in-lieu was paid). However, on a relative basis, some individual shareholders may have more shares of SLG’s common stock, and some individual shareholders may have fewer shares of SLG’s common stock, depending on their individual elections to receive cash or stock and as a result of the cash option being oversubscribed. 

SLG’s transfer agent, Computershare Inc. (“Computershare”), will act as SLG’s exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Computershare will manage the exchange of pre-split shares for post-split shares. Shareholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date will receive a letter of transmittal providing instructions for the exchange of their shares. Brokers, banks and other nominees will be instructed to effect the reverse stock split for their beneficial holders who hold shares of SLG’s common stock in street name. However, these brokers, banks and other nominees may have different procedures for processing the reverse stock split and for making payment for fractional shares than those procedures that apply to registered shareholders. Shareholders who hold shares of SLG’s common stock with a broker, bank or other nominee and who have any questions in this regard are encouraged to contact their brokers, banks or other nominees. For further information, shareholders and securities brokers should contact Computershare by telephone at 1-866-230-9138.
