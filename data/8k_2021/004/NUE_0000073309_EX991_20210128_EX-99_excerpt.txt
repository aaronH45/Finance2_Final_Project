For 2020, pre-operating and start-up costs related to the Company’s growth projects were approximately $101 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared with approximately $103 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for 2019.

Fourth Quarter of 2020 Analysis 

Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2020 improved compared to the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to higher pricing at our sheet and plate mills. Reflecting our product diversity, our steel mills segment also continued to benefit from strong results at our bar and structural mills. The fourth quarter of 2020 was another strong quarter for the steel products segment due to the continued resiliency of nonresidential construction markets. The profitability of the raw materials segment increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the third quarter of 2020 due to the improved financial performance of our direct reduced iron facilities that are benefitting from higher average selling prices for raw materials.  

First Quarter of 2021 Outlook 

As we enter 2021 we are encouraged by several positive factors impacting our markets. Nonresidential construction and automotive markets are strong, and we see generally improving conditions in heavy equipment, agriculture, renewable energy and on-highway truck and trailer. We expect earnings in the first quarter of 2021 to significantly increase from the fourth quarter of 2020. The expected performance of the steel mills segment in the first quarter of 2021 is the primary driver for this increase as our sheet, plate, bar and structural mills are forecasting increased profitability in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The profitability of our downstream steel products segment is expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to typical seasonal patterns and some margin compression related to the delay between rising steel input costs and increases in selling prices. The raw materials segment’s performance in the first quarter of 2021 is expected to be significantly improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to higher raw materials selling prices.  

Cash Dividend 

On December 3, 2020, Nucor’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.405 per share. This cash dividend is payable on February 11, 2021 to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2020 and is Nucor’s 191st consecutive quarterly cash dividend. Nucor has increased its regular, or base, dividend for 48 consecutive years – every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973. Over the past 10 years, Nucor has returned approximately $6 billion in capital to its stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
