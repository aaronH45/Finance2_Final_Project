CEO COMMENTARY

Harris H. Simmons, Chairman and CEO of Zions Bancorporation, commented, “We were quite pleased with the quarter, which was characterized by stable revenue despite the pressure of low interest rates and solid credit results, as reflected in very low net loan losses during a challenging time. Non-PPP loan volumes stabilized, with period-end loans flat with the third quarter, while deposits continued to exhibit very strong growth, with average deposits up an annualized 10.6% over the third quarter, and 20.3% over the same quarter a year ago.”

Mr. Simmons continued, “We are also pleased with the strength of our capital, as demonstrated by growth in our CET1 ratio to 10.8% from 10.2% in the year-ago period. Finally, with recently passed legislation authorizing a second round of PPP loans, we are working hard to deliver this aid to many thousands of small businesses throughout our footprint.”

OPERATING PERFORMANCE3

*Excluding the $30 million charitable contribution in the third quarter of 2020, the efficiency ratio for 2020 would have been 58.3%.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Rates are calculated using amounts in thousands and taxable-equivalent rates are used where applicable. 

Net interest income decreased $9 million, or 2%, to $550 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $559 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total interest income decreased $76 million, or 12%, due to a $58 million decrease in interest and fees on loans and a $14 million decrease in interest on securities; the decrease is primarily attributable to the lower interest rate environment, as the average balance of interest-earning assets increased 16%. Interest expense decreased $67 million, or 76%, due to a $49 million decline in interest paid on deposits and an $18 million decline in interest paid on short and long-term borrowings attributable to lower rates on both categories as well as reduced balances of borrowed funds. The decline in interest expense is also primarily attributable to the lower interest rate environment and partially attributable to reduced competitive pricing pressure for deposits. Additionally, strong deposit growth of $12.6 billion, or 22%, reduced the need for borrowed funds and was impacted by various government stimulus programs. 

The net interest margin declined to 2.95% in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with 3.06% in the third quarter of 2020, and 3.46% in the same prior year period. The yield on average interest-earning assets was 3.06%, a decrease of 14 basis points, compared with the third quarter of 2020, and a decrease of 94 basis points, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Average money market investments increased to 7.2% of average interest-earning assets in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with 4.3% in the third quarter of 2020, and 2.2% a year ago. This increase had a significant dilutive effect on the net interest margin.

The yield on average interest-earning assets included $6.3 billion of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans with a yield of 3.50%, which was modestly below the yield on the non-

PPP loan portfolio of 3.74%. During the fourth quarter of 2020, about 9,900 PPP loans, totaling $1.3 billion, received forgiveness by the SBA and contributed $26 million of interest income through accelerated recognition of net unamortized deferred fees on these loans. Additionally, on December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law, which extends the PPP and provides government funding for additional forgivable PPP loans. These developments, and other potential future program changes, will affect PPP interest income and the effective yield of the PPP loans in future periods. 

The yield on loans decreased 85 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the aforementioned decline in benchmark interest rates and continued competitive pricing pressure, which impacted loans across all major loan categories. The yield on securities decreased 52 basis points from the year ago period, primarily from lower yields on new investments, which were also attributable to lower benchmark interest rates. 

The annualized cost of total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 0.08%, compared with 0.44% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The rate paid on total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities was 0.12% for the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease from 0.57% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The decline in the rate paid on total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to lower benchmark interest rates, combined with strong deposit growth and average noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits rising to 47% from 42% a year ago. The deposit growth also allowed the Bank to significantly reduce more-costly borrowed funds when compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased by $14 million, or 9%, to $166 million from $152 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. Total customer-related fees increased to $139 million from $134 million for the same periods. Loan-related fees and income increased $6 million due to residential mortgage loan originations and sales, which benefited from the reduction in benchmark interest rates and our enhanced customer-facing digital fulfillment process. Retail and business banking fees decreased by $2 million primarily due to less customer activity, in addition to fee waivers, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Bank recognized a positive $8 million credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) on client-related interest rate swaps, compared with a positive $6 million CVA in the fourth quarter of 2019. Dividends and other income decreased to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower dividends received from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), reflecting less FHLB stock held by the Bank. Securities gains increased by $10 million, primarily as a result of realized gains on the sale of Farmer Mac Class C stock.

1 For information on non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 20-23.

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $424 million, a decrease of $48 million, or 10%, when compared with $472 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $28 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense and a decrease of $26 million in other noninterest expense. Salaries and employee benefits expense declined primarily as a result of the 5% workforce reduction announced in October 2019, which resulted in a $22 million severance charge in the fourth quarter of 2019. Other noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 included a $13 million impairment on owned or leased properties from branch and other office building closures, and $10 million of customer reimbursements made by the Bank to remedy a self-identified operational issue. Other noninterest expense also declined due to a $5 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses. 

These decreases in noninterest expense were partially offset by a $6 million increase in professional and legal services related to technology spend and third-party assistance related to PPP loan forgiveness, as well as a $3 million increase in advertising expense primarily associated with our efforts to retain "new to Bank" PPP recipients.

Adjusted noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased $12 million, or 3%, to $423 million, compared with $435 million for the same prior year period. The efficiency ratio improved to 60.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with 62.2% for the third quarter of 2020, and 61.3% the fourth quarter of 2019. For information on non-GAAP financial measures, including differences between noninterest expense and adjusted noninterest expense, see pages 20-23.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Does not include loans held for sale.

Net loan and lease charge-offs were $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The ratio of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more to loans and leases (ex-PPP) was 0.79% for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with 0.52% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The ratio of classified loans to total loans and leases (ex-PPP) was 3.4%, compared with 1.6% for the same periods, respectively.

During 2020, the Bank provided payment deferrals or other payment modifications related to COVID-19 hardships, with respect to approximately $4.3 billion of total loan balances. As of December 31, 2020, $3.8 billion was outstanding, of which $3.4 billion, or 89%, had payments deferred, while the remaining $0.4 billion, or 11%, had their regularly scheduled payments otherwise modified, and approximately $42 million, or 1.1%, were 90 days or more past due. As of December 31, 2020, about $234 million, or 0.5%, of total loan balances (ex-PPP) were actively in a deferral related to COVID-19, including re-deferrals.

The Bank recorded a negative $67 million provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with a positive $55 million during the third quarter of 2020, and a positive $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) was $835 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $917 million at September 30, 2020, and $554 million at December 31, 2019. The ACL decreased from September 30, 2020, as economic forecasts and both experienced and expected credit quality improved. The increase in the ACL, compared with the same prior year period, is primarily due to the economic stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ratio of total ACL to total loans and leases (ex-PPP) was 1.74% at December 31, 2020, compared with 1.91% at September 30, 2020, and 1.14% at December 31, 2019.

Loans and leases, net of unearned income and fees, increased $4.8 billion, or 10%, to $53.5 billion at December 31, 2020, from $48.7 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to the origination of PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, commercial loans decreased by $488 million, as the stressed economic environment adversely impacted demand for these loans. Within commercial loans, a $1.3 billion decrease in commercial and industrial loans was partially offset by increases of $558 million in municipal loans and $284 million in owner-occupied commercial loans. Term commercial real estate loans increased $415 million. Consumer loans decreased $866 million, which was spread across all consumer loan subcategories. Unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit increased $900 million, or 3.8%, to $24.8 billion at December 31, 2020, from $23.9 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in commitment utilization.

1Because many borrowers operate in multiple businesses, judgment has been applied in characterizing a borrower as oil and

gas-related, including a particular segment of oil and gas-related activity, e.g., upstream or midstream; typically, 50% of

revenues coming from the oil and gas sector is used as a guide.

2Total oil and gas-related loan and lease balances at both December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020 include approximately $171 million of PPP loans, respectively.

At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, oil and gas-related loans represented 4% and 5% of the total loan portfolio, respectively. Due to active risk management of the portfolio, the mix of oil and gas-related loans at December 31, 2020 consists of 40% upstream, 35% midstream, 17% oil and gas-related services, and 8% downstream, compared with 42%, 34%, 18%, and 6%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Upstream loans are made to reserve-based borrowers, and approximately 81% of the upstream loans are collateralized by the value of the borrower’s oil and gas reserves. For the fourth quarter of 2020, the oil and gas-related classified loan ratio was 11.9%, the annualized net charge-off ratio was 2.1%, and the allowance for credit losses related to oil and gas-related loans was 4.5%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total deposits increased by $12.6 billion, or 22%, to $69.7 billion as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to an $8.9 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, which was impacted by various government stimulus programs.

Average total deposits increased to $68.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $56.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased 35% to $32.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, from $23.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, and were 47% and 42% of average total deposits, respectively, for the same periods. 

Total borrowed funds decreased $0.9 billion, or 23%, to $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2020. Average borrowed funds decreased to $2.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $4.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease in both end-of-period and average borrowed funds reflects less reliance on federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings due to the strength of deposit growth, which significantly exceeded earning asset growth over this period.

Shareholders’ Equity

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Bank’s common stock dividend was $0.34 per share, the same as the fourth quarter of 2019. Accumulated other comprehensive income improved $282 million to $325 million as of December 31, 2020, compared with $43 million as of December 31, 2019. The improvement was primarily a result of increases in the fair value of available-for-sale securities due to changes in interest rates. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 14.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the out-of-the-money expiration of 29.2 million ZIONW warrants on May 22, 2020. 

Tangible book value per common share increased to $38.42 at December 31, 2020, compared with $34.98 at December 31, 2019. Basel III common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital was $6.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2019. The estimated Basel III CET1 capital ratio was 10.8% at December 31, 2020, compared with 10.2% at December 31, 2019. For information on non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 20-23. 

On January 1, 2020, the Bank adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and its subsequent updates, often referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") accounting standard. The OCC, Federal Reserve and FDIC issued a joint statement on March 27, 2020, revised on April 7, 2020, with proposed guidance for banking institutions that have adopted CECL in 2020. The Bank adopted the provisions of this interim final rule, which allows banks to add back, for regulatory capital purposes only, a transition adjustment related to CECL beginning with the first quarter 2020 financial statements. The adoption of these provisions improved our CET1 capital ratio at December 31, 2020 by 10 basis points.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(Unaudited)

This press release presents non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to provide investors with additional information. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following schedules. The Bank considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance and financial position of the Bank and for presentations of Bank performance to investors. The Bank further believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Bank on the same basis as that applied by management.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP. 

The following are non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release and a discussion of the reasons for which management uses these non-GAAP measures:

Tangible Book Value per Common Share – this schedule also includes “tangible common equity.” Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides additional useful information about the level of tangible equity in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information to management and others about capital adequacy because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information about performance because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

Efficiency Ratio – this schedule also includes “adjusted noninterest expense,” “taxable-equivalent net interest income,” “adjusted taxable-equivalent revenue,” “pre-provision net revenue (PPNR)” and “adjusted PPNR.” The methodology of determining the efficiency ratio may differ among companies. Management makes adjustments to exclude certain items as identified in the subsequent schedule which it believes allows for more consistent comparability among periods. Management believes the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how well the Bank is managing its expenses, and adjusted PPNR enables management and others to assess the Bank’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.
