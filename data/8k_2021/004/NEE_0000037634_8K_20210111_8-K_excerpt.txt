SECTION 7 - REGULATION FD

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure

On January 11, 2021, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy), issued a news release regarding its intent to initiate a base rate proceeding in March 2021. A copy of the news release is attached as Exhibit 99, which is incorporated herein by reference.

SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS

Item 8.01 Other Events

On January 11, 2021, FPL filed a formal notification with the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) indicating its intent to initiate a base rate proceeding by submitting a four-year rate plan that would begin in January 2022 replacing the current base rate settlement agreement that has been in place since 2017. As Gulf Power Company legally merged with FPL on January 1, 2021, the notification indicates that the plan will include the total revenue requirements of the combined utility system, reflecting the legal and operational consolidation of Gulf Power Company into FPL. The notification also states that, based on preliminary estimates, FPL expects to request a general base annual revenue requirement increase of approximately $1.1 billion effective January 2022 and a subsequent annual increase of approximately $615 million effective January 2023. The plan is also expected to request authority for a Solar Base Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) mechanism to recover, subject to FPSC review, the revenue requirements of up to 900 megawatts (MW) of solar projects in 2024 and up to 900 MW in 2025. Under the filing, FPL does not expect to request further adjustments to general base annual revenue requirements to be effective before January 2026. If the full amount of new solar capacity allowed under the proposed SoBRA mechanism were constructed, FPL’s preliminary estimate is that it would result in base rate adjustments of approximately $140 million in 2024 and $140 million in 2025. The proposed SoBRA mechanism adjustments would be offset, in part, by a reduction in FPL’s fuel costs. In addition, FPL expects to propose an allowed regulatory return on common equity midpoint of 11.50 percent, which includes a 50 basis point performance incentive. FPL expects to file its formal request to initiate a base rate proceeding in March 2021.

Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy) and FPL regarding future operating results and other future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of NextEra Energy's and FPL's control. Forward-looking statements include, among others, statements concerning FPL's plans for requesting new base rates. In some cases, you can identify the forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as “will,” “may result,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “potential,” “projection,” “forecast,” “predict,” “goals,” “target,” “outlook,” “should,” “would” or similar words or expressions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance. The future results of NextEra Energy and FPL and their business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause their actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, or may require them to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: effects of extensive regulation of NextEra Energy's and FPL's business operations; inability of NextEra Energy and FPL to recover in a timely manner any significant amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise; impact of political, regulatory and economic factors on regulatory decisions important to NextEra Energy and FPL; disallowance of cost recovery by FPL based on a finding of imprudent use of derivative instruments; effect of any reductions or modifications to, or elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support utility scale renewable energy projects of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities (NextEra Energy Resources) or the imposition of additional tax laws, policies or assessments on renewable energy; impact of new or revised laws, regulations, interpretations or ballot or regulatory initiatives on NextEra Energy and FPL; capital expenditures, increased operating costs and various liabilities attributable to environmental laws, regulations and other standards applicable to NextEra Energy and FPL; effects on NextEra Energy and FPL of federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of greenhouse gas emissions; exposure of NextEra Energy and FPL to significant and increasing compliance costs and substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions as a result of extensive federal regulation of their operations and businesses; effect on NextEra Energy and FPL of changes in tax laws, guidance or policies as well as in judgments and estimates used to determine tax-related asset and liability amounts; impact on NextEra Energy and FPL of adverse results of litigation; effect on NextEra Energy and FPL of failure to proceed with projects under development or inability to complete the construction of (or capital improvements to) electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities or other facilities on schedule or within budget; impact on development and operating activities of NextEra Energy and FPL resulting from risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; risks involved in the operation and maintenance of electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities, retail gas distribution system in Florida and other facilities; effect on NextEra Energy and FPL of a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of

inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage for protection of NextEra Energy and FPL against significant losses and risk that insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; a prolonged period of low gas and oil prices could impact NextEra Energy Resources’ gas infrastructure business and cause NextEra Energy Resources to delay or cancel certain gas infrastructure projects and could result in certain projects becoming impaired; risk to NextEra Energy Resources of increased operating costs resulting from unfavorable supply costs necessary to provide NextEra Energy Resources' full energy and capacity requirement services; inability or failure by NextEra Energy Resources to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risk within its portfolio; effect of reductions in the liquidity of energy markets on NextEra Energy's ability to manage operational risks; effectiveness of NextEra Energy's and FPL's risk management tools associated with their hedging and trading procedures to protect against significant losses, including the effect of unforeseen price variances from historical behavior; impact of unavailability or disruption of power transmission or commodity transportation facilities on sale and delivery of power or natural gas by NextEra Energy, including FPL; exposure of NextEra Energy and FPL to credit and performance risk from customers, hedging counterparties and vendors;

changes in market value and other risks to certain of NextEra Energy's investments; effect of inability of NextEra Energy subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NextEra Energy or of NextEra Energy's performance under guarantees of subsidiary obligations on NextEra Energy's ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock; the fact that the amount and timing of dividends payable on NextEra Energy's common stock, as well as the dividend policy approved by NextEra Energy's board of directors from time to time, and changes to that policy, are within the sole discretion of NextEra Energy's board of directors and, if declared and paid, dividends may be in amounts that are less than might be expected by shareholders; NEP’s inability to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms could have an effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NextEra Energy’s limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP; effects of disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets on the market price of NextEra Energy's common stock; and the ultimate severity and duration of the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on NextEra Energy’s or FPL’s businesses. NextEra Energy and FPL discuss these and other risks and uncertainties in their annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and other SEC filings, and this Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with such SEC filings. The forward-looking statements made in this Form 8-K are made only as of the date of this Form 8-K and NextEra Energy and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
