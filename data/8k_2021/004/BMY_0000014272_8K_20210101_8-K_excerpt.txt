 Item 8.01.  Other Events.    

On January 1, 2021, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing that the Biologics License Application for lisocabtagene maraleucel (“liso-cel”) for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma after at least two prior therapies remains under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and that the Company has not received a decision for this application. Since the FDA’s approval of liso-cel did not occur by December 31, 2020, one of the three required milestones for payment of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Contingent Value Right (“CVR”) was not met. As a result, on January 1, 2021, the Contingent Value Rights Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2019 (the “CVR Agreement”), pursuant to which the CVRs were issued, terminated automatically in accordance with its terms and the CVRs are no longer eligible for payment under the CVR Agreement. The CVRs will no longer trade on the NYSE. 

A copy of the press release issued by the Company is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
