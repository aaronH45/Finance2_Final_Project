ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

On January 12, 2021, Becton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”) issued a press release announcing its preliminary unaudited revenues for its first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2020. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.

The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 presents preliminary unaudited revenues for the fiscal first quarter 2021, including revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis after eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation, which can fluctuate from period to period. This presentation of preliminary unaudited revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis is a non-GAAP financial measure in that it differs from revenue growth presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We present preliminary unaudited currency-neutral revenue growth to help investors better understand the underlying performance of BD for the first fiscal quarter and evaluate such performance in comparison to the prior period.

BD’s management uses this non-GAAP measure in its own evaluation of BD’s performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods and to the performance of peer companies. Management also uses our non-GAAP results for budget planning purposes on a quarterly and annual basis.

BD provides non-GAAP measures to investors on a supplemental basis in addition to its GAAP results, as they provide additional insight into BD’s financial results. Management believes the non-GAAP results provide a reasonable measure of BD’s underlying performance before the effects of items that are considered by management to be outside of BD’s underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability. However, non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP results. Also, our non-GAAP results may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Although BD’s management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD’s net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. Investors should also consider these limitations when evaluating BD’s results. 

The information in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, is being furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this Item 2.02 and Exhibit 99.1 shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
