ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

On February 4, 2021, Becton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2020. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP measures”), as follows:

•Currency-Neutral Revenue Growth. We present revenue growth rates for our first fiscal quarter and the corresponding prior period, and our estimated revenue growth for our fiscal year 2021, after eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation, which can fluctuate from period to period. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. 

•Adjusted Earnings Per Share. We present diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for the quarter and the corresponding prior period, after eliminating items that we believe are not part of our ordinary operations and affect the comparability of the periods presented (“adjusted EPS”). We also present adjusted EPS for the full 2020 fiscal year. Adjusted EPS includes adjustments for purchase accounting adjustments, integration and restructuring costs, divestiture-related gains, certain product liability reserves and remediation costs, the impact of the extinguishment of debt, certain regulatory costs, certain asset impairments, and the dilutive impact of outstanding preferred stock. We believe adjustments for these items allow investors to better understand the underlying operating results of BD and facilitate comparisons between the periods shown. We also show the growth in adjusted EPS compared to the prior year period after eliminating the impact of foreign currency translation to further enable investors to evaluate BD’s underlying earnings performance compared to the prior period.

We also present our estimated adjusted EPS growth for our 2021 fiscal year after adjusting for the anticipated impact of foreign currency translation. Management believes that this adjustment allows investors to better evaluate BD’s anticipated underlying earnings performance for our 2021 fiscal year in relation to our underlying 2020 fiscal year performance.

Details regarding these adjustments can be found in the schedules included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
