On February 10, 2021, the Board of Trustees (“Board”) of Federal Realty Investment Trust (“Company”) promoted Mr. Jeffrey S. Berkes, 57, to President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Mr. Berkes served as the Company’s Executive Vice President-Western Region President from 2011 to 2021 and prior to that time held other officer positions within Company, including Chief Investment Officer (2003 – 2011). Mr. Donald C. Wood will remain the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.

In connection with Mr. Berkes’ promotion, he will receive the following compensation: (a) an annual base salary of $575,000; (b) eligibility for an annual bonus under our annual bonus plan targeted at 100% of his annual base salary; (c) eligibility for an annual equity award under our long-term incentive plan with a target level of $1,000,000; (d) a $1,000,000 restricted share award that vests equally over five years subject to Mr. Berkes’ continued employment with the Company; and (e) a performance share award of between $500,000 and $2,000,000 depending on the Company’s total annual shareholder return relative to the total annual shareholder return of the Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center Index during the four-year period from 2021 through 2024. The performance share award agreement is filed as an exhibit to this report.

The Company and Mr. Berkes also entered into an amended and restated severance and change in control agreement that will provide for payments and benefits to Mr. Berkes in the event he is terminated without cause, resigns on constructive termination or there occurs a change in control, subject to the terms and conditions described in the agreement. The amended and restated severance agreement is filed as an exhibit to this report.

Also on February 10, 2021, the Compensation Committee (“Committee”) of the Board approved payment of an annual bonus to Donald C.

Becker, our Executive Vice President-General Counsel and Secretary, and Daniel Guglielmone, our Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, equal to 75% of their respective target award under our annual bonus plan. The Committee exercised its discretion in making these annual bonus awards in light of the work that was done to address the impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s business.
