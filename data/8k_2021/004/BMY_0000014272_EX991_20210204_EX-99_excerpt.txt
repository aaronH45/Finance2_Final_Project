FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS

All comparisons are made versus the same period in 2019 unless otherwise stated.

•Bristol Myers Squibb posted fourth quarter revenues of $11.1 billion, an increase of 39% on a reported basis and 10% on a pro forma basis. The increase was driven primarily by the impact of the Celgene Acquisition, which was completed on November 20, 2019.

•U.S. revenues increased 43% to $6.8 billion in the quarter. International revenues increased 34% to $4.3 billion in the quarter. When adjusted for foreign exchange impact, international revenues increased 30%. 

•Gross margin increased from 68.6% to 73.7% in the quarter primarily due to product mix, lower unwinding of inventory purchase price accounting adjustments, partially offset by an impairment charge related to Inrebic marketed product rights. 

•Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 57% to $2.7 billion in the quarter primarily due to $400 million of costs associated with the broader portfolio resulting from the Celgene Acquisition, as well as higher advertising and promotion expenses and cash settlement of MyoKardia unvested stock awards. 

2

•Research and development expenses increased 79% to $3.8 billion in the quarter primarily due to $500 million of costs associated with the broader portfolio resulting from the Celgene Acquisition, as well as license and acquisition charges related to Dragonfly, an in-process research and development (IPR&D) impairment charge related to the discontinuation of the orva-cel program development and cash settlement of MyoKardia unvested stock awards. 

•Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased to $2.5 billion in the quarter reflecting the full quarter amortization from the Celgene Acquisition. 

•IPR&D charge of $11.4 billion was included in the quarter due to the MyoKardia transaction being accounted for as an asset acquisition. 

•The effective tax benefit rate was 4.1% in the current quarter and includes the impact of the non-deductible MyoKardia IPR&D charge. Income taxes were $931 million despite pre-tax loss of $129 million in the same period a year ago primarily due to the Otezla® divestiture, certain non-deductible expenses and purchase price adjustments.

•The company reported net loss attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb of $10.0 billion, or $4.45 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to net loss of $1.1 billion, or $0.55 per share, for the same period a year ago. The results in the current quarter include costs and expenses resulting from the IPRD charge related to the MyoKardia asset acquisition, purchase price accounting from the Celgene Acquisition, contingent value rights fair value adjustments, equity investment gains, intangible assets impairment charges and other acquisition and integration expenses. 

•The company reported non-GAAP net earnings attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb of $3.3 billion, or $1.46 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to non-GAAP net earnings of $2.4 billion, or $1.22 per share, for the same period a year ago. A discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures is included under the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” section.

•An effective tax rate of approximately 22% for GAAP and approximately 16% for non-GAAP.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

This earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information that are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying financial tables and also available on the company’s website at www.bms.com.

These non-GAAP items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods, including amortization of acquired intangible assets beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue, unwind of inventory fair value adjustments, acquisition and integration expenses, restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, R&D charges or other income resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights, costs of acquiring a priority review voucher, IPRD charge resulting from the MyoKardia acquisition, divestiture gains or losses, stock compensation resulting from accelerated vesting of Celgene awards, certain retention-related employee compensation charges related to the Celgene Acquisition, pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, interest expense on the notes issued in May 2019 incurred prior to the Celgene Acquisition and interest income earned on the net proceeds of those notes, equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments and amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from internal transfer of intangible assets and the Otezla® Divestiture. This earnings release also provides international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of the company’s baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors overall understanding of the company’s underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information are indications of the company’s baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of the company’s ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators that we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

In connection with presenting our outlook, we are also providing revenue (ex-FX) and non-GAAP operating margin guidance for 2020-2025. There are no reliable or reasonably estimable comparable GAAP measures for this because we are not able to reliably predict the impact of specified items or currency exchange rates beyond the next twelve months. As a result, the 

12

reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. In addition, the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. The variability of the specified items may have a significant and unpredictable impact on our future GAAP results.

One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, the company’s ability to execute successfully its strategic plans, including its business development strategy generally and in relation to its ability to realize the projected benefits of the Celgene Acquisition and the MyoKardia Acquisition, the full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s operations and the development and commercialization of its products, potential laws and regulations to lower drug costs, market actions taken by private and government payers to manage drug utilization and contain costs, the expiration of patents or data protection on certain products, including assumptions about the company’s ability to retain patent exclusivity of certain products and the impact and the result of governmental investigations.

and objectives to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other matters include, but are not limited to, risks relating to various risks related to public health outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s operations and that the company cannot reasonably assess or predict at this time the full extent of the adverse effect that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; increasing pricing pressures from market access, pharmaceutical pricing controls and discounting, changes to tax and importation laws and other restrictions in the United States, the European Union and other regions around the world that result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and smaller populations for whom payers will reimburse; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval; the company’s ability to obtain and protect market exclusivity rights and enforce patents and other intellectual property rights; the possibility of difficulties and delays in product introduction and commercialization; the risk of certain novel approaches to disease treatment (such as CAR T therapy); industry competition from other manufacturers; potential difficulties, delays and disruptions in manufacturing, distribution or sale of products, including without limitation, interruptions caused by damage to the company’s and the company’s suppliers’ manufacturing sites; integrating the company’s and Celgene’s business and operations, including with respect to human capital management, portfolio rationalization, finance and accounting systems, sales operations and product distribution, pricing systems and methodologies, data security systems, compliance programs and internal controls processes, on the company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the Celgene Acquisition; the risk of an adverse patent litigation decision or settlement and exposure to other litigation and/or regulatory actions; the impact of any healthcare reform and legislation or regulatory action in the United States and international markets; changes in tax law and regulations; the failure of the company’s suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, alliance partners and other third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations; regulatory decisions impacting labeling, manufacturing processes and/or other matters; the impact on the company’s competitive position from counterfeit or unregistered versions of its products or stolen products; the adverse impact of cyber-attacks on the company’s information systems or products, including unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or other confidential data stored in the company’s information systems and networks; the company’s ability to execute its financial, strategic and operational plans; the company’s ability to identify potential strategic acquisitions, licensing opportunities or other beneficial transactions; the company’s dependency on several key products; any decline in the company’s future royalty streams; the company’s ability to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances and other portfolio actions and to successfully realize the expected benefits of such actions; the company’s ability to attract and retain key personnel; the impact of the company’s significant additional indebtedness that it incurred in connection with the Celgene Acquisition and the MyoKardia Acquisition and its issuance of additional shares in connection with the Celgene Acquisition on its ability to operate the combined company; political and financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, credit and foreign exchange risk management; our exclusive forum provision in our by-laws for certain lawsuits could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a judicial forum that it finds favorable for such lawsuits; and issuance of new or revised accounting standards. In addition, the financial guidance provided in this release relies on assumptions about the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, timing of the return to a more stable business environment, patient and physician behaviors, buying patterns and clinical trial activities (together, the “Recovery Process”), among other things. If the actual Recovery Process differs materially from our assumptions, the 

14

impact of COVID-19 on our business could be worse than expected and our results may be negatively impacted.
