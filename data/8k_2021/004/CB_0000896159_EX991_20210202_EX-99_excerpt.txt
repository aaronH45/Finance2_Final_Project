Full Year Summary  

(in millions of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)  

(Unaudited)  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the tax expenses (benefits) related to the table above were $(17) million and $(30) million, respectively, for amortization of fair value adjustment of acquired invested assets and long-term debt, and other; $24 million and $15 million, respectively, for adjusted net realized gains and losses; and $622 million and $810 million, respectively, for core operating income.  

Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chubb Limited, commented: “Chubb had an excellent fourth quarter finish to the year, highlighted by very strong earnings, resulting from continued underwriting margin improvement and double-digit commercial lines premium growth globally. Core operating income per share of $3.18 was up nearly 40% with net income per share a record. Our P&C underwriting income was up 82%, with a published combined ratio of 87.6% compared to 92.7% prior year. The margin improvement in our combined ratio was a result of both expense and loss ratio improvements that were broad based. Virtually all of our commercial P&C lines of business are achieving rates that exceed loss costs.  

“In the quarter, Global P&C premium revenue, which excludes agriculture, grew 6%. Commercial lines grew over 11% as we capitalized on a strong and continuously improving pricing environment in most regions of the world. In fact, the pricing environment was the strongest we’ve seen since rates in certain classes began to rise about three years ago. Commercial rate increases averaged 16.5% and 18.5%, respectively, in our North America and international businesses. I expect the favorable underwriting conditions to continue. On the other hand, net premiums declined 3.9% in our consumer lines businesses globally, which have been impacted by the pandemic’s effects on consumer activity, but will improve as the year progresses. The one exception of note is our U.S. high net worth personal lines business, which grew in the quarter and the year – a testament to our market-leading franchise.  

“For the year, we produced $3.3 billion of core operating income, published a P&C combined ratio of 96.1%, achieved premium revenue growth of 5.4% in constant dollars, with commercial lines growth of 9.3%, and grew tangible book value per share 12.2% – reasonably good results overall given the remarkable and unprecedented events we all faced.  

“We are off to a good start in ‘21 with both growth and the level of commercial P&C rate increases resembling the underwriting conditions of the fourth quarter. With our leadership energized and our people focused, and given our full range of capabilities to bring to bear for our clients and business partners, we are confident in our ability to continue growing revenue and expanding underwriting margins.”

Chubb Limited News Release  

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In presenting our results, we included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  

Throughout this document there are various measures presented on a constant-dollar basis (i.e., excludes the impact of foreign exchange). We believe it is useful to evaluate the trends in our results exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted, as these exchange rates could fluctuate significantly between periods and distort the analysis of trends. The impact is determined by assuming constant foreign exchange rates between periods by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period.  

Adjusted net investment income is net investment income excluding the amortization of the fair value adjustment on acquired invested assets from the acquisition of The Chubb Corporation (Chubb Corp) of $26 million in Q4 2020 and $116 million for full-year 2020 and including investment income of $51 million in Q4 2020 and $115 million for full-year 2020 from partially owned investment companies (private equity partnerships) where our ownership interest is in excess of three percent that are accounted for under the equity method. The mark-to-market movement on these private equity partnerships are included in adjusted net realized gains (losses) as described below. We believe this measure is meaningful as it highlights the underlying performance of our invested assets and portfolio management in support of our lines of business.  

Adjusted net realized gains (losses), net of tax, includes net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) recorded in other income (expense) related to unconsolidated subsidiaries, and excludes realized gains and losses on crop derivatives. These derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. We view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations, and therefore realized gains (losses) from these derivatives are reclassified to adjusted losses and loss expenses.  

P&C underwriting income is calculated by subtracting adjusted losses and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned by our P&C operations. We use P&C underwriting income and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other income (expense), interest expense, amortization expense of purchased intangibles, Chubb integration expenses, income tax expense and adjusted net realized gains (losses).  

Current accident year underwriting income excluding catastrophe losses is underwriting income adjusted to exclude catastrophe losses and prior period development (PPD). We believe it is useful to exclude catastrophe losses, as they are not predictable as to timing and amount, and PPD as these unexpected loss developments on historical reserves are not indicative of our current underwriting performance. We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.  

Core operating income, net of tax, excludes from net income the after-tax impact of adjusted net realized gains (losses), Chubb integration expenses, and the amortization of fair value adjustment of acquired invested assets and long-term debt related to the Chubb Corp acquisition. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude adjusted net realized gains (losses) because the amount of these gains (losses) are heavily influenced by, and fluctuate in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. We exclude the amortization of the fair value adjustments related to purchased  

 Chubb®, Chubb logo® and Chubb. Insured.SM are trademarks of Chubb.   10  

Chubb Limited News Release  

invested assets and long-term debt and Chubb integration expenses due to the size and complexity of this acquisition. These integration expenses are distortive to our results and are not indicative of our underlying profitability. We believe that excluding these integration expenses facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results. References to core operating income measures mean net of tax, whether or not noted.  

Core operating return on equity (ROE) and Core operating return on tangible equity (ROTE) are annualized non-GAAP financial measures. The numerator includes core operating income (loss), net of tax. The denominator includes the average shareholders’ equity for the period adjusted to exclude unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. For the ROTE calculation, the denominator is also adjusted to exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net of tax. These measures enhances the understanding of the return on shareholders’ equity by highlighting the underlying profitability relative to shareholders’ equity and tangible equity excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments.  

P&C combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss expense ratio, acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio excluding the life business and including the realized gains and losses on the crop derivatives, as noted above.  

Current accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses excludes the impact of catastrophe losses and PPD from the combined ratio. We believe this measure provides a better evaluation of our underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our property and casualty business that may be obscured by these items.  

Global P&C performance metrics comprise consolidated operating results (including corporate) and exclude the operating results of the company’s Life Insurance and North America Agricultural Insurance segments. The agriculture insurance business is a different business in that it is a public sector and private sector partnership in which insurance rates, premium growth, and risk-sharing is not market-driven like the remainder of the company’s P&C insurance business. We believe that these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company’s global P&C operations which are the most economically similar. We exclude the North America Agricultural Insurance and Life Insurance segments because the results of these businesses do not always correlate with the results of our global P&C operations.  

Tangible book value per common share is shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net of tax, divided by the shares outstanding. We believe that goodwill and other intangible assets are not indicative of our underlying insurance results or trends and make book value comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies less meaningful.  

See the reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 29-35 in the Financial Supplement. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP, including premium, net income, return on equity, and net investment income.
