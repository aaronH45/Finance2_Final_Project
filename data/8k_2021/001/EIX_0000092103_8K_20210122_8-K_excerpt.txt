This current report and its exhibits include forward-looking statements. Edison International and Southern California Edison Company ("SCE") based these forward-looking statements on their current expectations and projections about future events in light of their knowledge of facts as of the date of this current report and their assumptions about future circumstances. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may be outside the control of Edison International and SCE. Edison International and SCE have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, future events, or otherwise. This current report should be read with Edison International's and SCE's combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Additionally, Edison International and SCE post or provide direct links to certain documents and information related to Southern California wildfires which may be of interest to investors at www.edisoninvestor.com (Southern California Wildfires) in order to publicly disseminate such information.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure

SCE has issued a press release announcing the settlements discussed in Item 8.01 below. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. 

Item 8.01 Other Events

As previously disclosed, multiple lawsuits have been initiated against SCE and Edison International related to the “Thomas Fire” that originated on December 4, 2017 in the Anlauf Canyon area of Ventura County, the “Koenigstein Fire” that originated on December 4, 2017 near Koenigstein Road in the City of Santa Paula, and the “Woolsey Fire” that originated on November 8, 2018 in Ventura County. Some of the lawsuits related to the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires assert that SCE and Edison International have responsibility for the damages caused by mudslides and flooding in Montecito and surrounding areas in January 2018 (the “Montecito Mudslides,” and collectively with the Thomas Fire, Koenigstein Fire and Woolsey Fire, the “2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events”). 

On January 22, 2021, SCE entered into an agreement (the “Settlement”) with all of the insurance subrogation plaintiffs in the Woolsey Fire litigation (the “Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs”) to settle all of their claims. Under the Settlement, SCE agreed to pay the Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs an aggregate of $2.2 billion by April 22, 2021. This payment equals $0.67 for each dollar in claims already paid by the Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs to their policy holders. SCE has also agreed to pay $0.67 for each dollar in claims to be paid by the Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs to their policy holders on or before July 15, 2023, up to an agreed upon cap (the “Future Settlement Payments”). No admission of wrongdoing or liability was made in reaching the Settlement, and the Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs have agreed to release SCE and Edison International from all claims and potential claims in the Woolsey Fire litigation and/or related to or arising from the Woolsey Fire.

Previously, SCE has settled other claims in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation. In November 2019, SCE reached a settlement with a number of local public entities in the Thomas Fire, Koenigstein Fire and Montecito Mudslides litigation and a separate settlement with a number of local public entities in the Woolsey Fire litigation. In September 2020, SCE reached a settlement with all the insurance subrogation plaintiffs in the Thomas Fire, Koenigstein Fire and Montecito Mudslides litigation. SCE has also reached settlements with approximately one thousand individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation. Other claims and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events remain. SCE continues to explore reasonable settlement opportunities with plaintiffs in the outstanding 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation. 

After consideration of the Settlement and other available information, Edison International and SCE have concluded that no adjustment to the total losses accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events is required at this time. 

For additional information regarding the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, including Edison International and SCE’s process for estimating losses associated with wildfire litigation claims, “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies—Contingencies—Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides” and “Legal Proceedings” in the Edison International and SCE Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020.
