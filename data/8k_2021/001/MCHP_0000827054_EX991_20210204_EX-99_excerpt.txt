Financial Results

GAAP net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 were $1.35 billion, up 5.0% from net sales of $1.29 billion in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. 

GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was $36.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, down from GAAP net income of $311.1 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, GAAP net income was significantly adversely impacted by purchase accounting adjustments associated with our acquisitions. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, GAAP net income was significantly adversely impacted by a loss on debt settlement.

Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was $444.9 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, up from non-GAAP net income of $340.8 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions on manufacturing activities, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, IT security remediation costs, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, losses on the settlement of debt, and gains related to equity investments. For the third quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.

Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 39 cents per share, up 5.8% from the cash dividend paid last quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 8, 2021 to stockholders of record on February 22, 2021.

"The December quarter represented a shift of the business cycle back to growth as we saw a 3.3% sequential growth in revenue during the December quarter, which typically would be a sequentially down quarter in a normal seasonal environment," said Steve Sanghi, Chief Executive Officer. "Supply constraints in the industry are creating lots of challenges in meeting customer demand and our global operations team is working hard at increasing production at our internal factories and also working with our supply chain partners to get larger allocations of manufacturing capacity and materials."

Mr. Sanghi added, "We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin of 63% and a record non-GAAP operating margin of 39.8% in the December quarter. We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $1.62 which was 5 cents above the midpoint of our guidance."

"In the December quarter, we saw the automotive, industrial and consumer home appliance markets strengthen further," said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Operating Officer. "As expected, the end markets that benefited earlier in 2020 from the work from home and medical related demand surge remained at more normal demand patterns. Finally, demand for our products that go into the office environment remained weak as many businesses remain predominantly with work from home policies, thus deferring spending for these items."

Mr. Moorthy added, "During the December quarter, a robust overall business environment, accentuated by rising demand in the automotive, industrial and consumer end market, along with low levels of inventory in the distribution channel, resulted in supply constraints in practically all of our internal and external factories. In spite of our concerted efforts to increase our capacity, we expect the supply constraints we are currently seeing to continue through much of calendar year 2021. As a result, we have seen our lead times stretch out for many of our products where the constraints are more acute. We have also experienced increases in material and sub-contracted manufacturing costs and have had to take steps to secure capacity for calendar year 2021 as well as adjust our pricing accordingly."

Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "We continued to aggressively pay down our debt with another $289.7 million of payments during the December quarter, reflecting a cumulative debt pay down of $3.24 billion over the past ten quarters, as we have actively managed the working capital requirements for the business. In the December quarter, we executed multiple debt transactions which both reduced the amount of convertible bonds we have on our balance sheet as well as reduced the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt. In calendar year 2020, we reduced the amount of convertible bonds on Microchip's balance sheet by approximately $2.9 billion. We believe that these actions with our convertible bonds will continue to benefit our stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time."

Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Our December quarter bookings were strong and have continued that way through January, resulting in record levels of backlog and long-term order visibility. Supply constraints are currently a significant challenge as our internal and external manufacturing capacity is facing limitations. We expect our net sales in the March quarter to be up between 5% and 10% sequentially. We are guiding to a much stronger than seasonal March quarter and we expect significant revenue growth in calendar year 2021."

The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. We are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease during the quarter and are therefore providing a range of GAAP net sales guidance. In recent years, we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this release for information regarding our non-GAAP guidance.

(2) We are not able to estimate the amount of certain Special Charges and Other, net that may be incurred during the quarter ending March 31, 2021. Therefore, our estimate of GAAP operating expenses excludes certain amounts that may be recognized as Special Charges and Other, net in the quarter ending March 31, 2021.

(3) The forecast for GAAP tax expense excludes any unexpected tax events that may occur during the quarter, as these amounts cannot be forecasted.

(4) Represents expected cash tax rate for fiscal 2021 excluding any transition tax payments associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

•Microchip's inventory days in the March 2021 quarter are expected to be in the range of 111 to 119 days, compared to 120 days at December 31, 2020. Our actual inventory level will depend on the inventory that our distributors decide to hold to support their customers, overall demand for our products and our production levels.

•Capital expenditures for the quarter ending March 31, 2021 are expected to be between $50 million and $60 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2021 are expected to be between $87 million and $97 million. We are continuing to invest in the equipment needed to support the growth of our production capabilities, and to mitigate industry capacity constraints, by bringing in-house some of our wafer fabrication, assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced.

Under the new GAAP revenue recognition standard which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving

inventory into our distribution network. Therefore, the elements of our internal performance and executive and employee compensation metrics that are based on sales and operating results are measured using the value of the end-market demand for our products. We use end-market demand for these purposes because we do not believe that the underlying value of our business benefits from increases in the value of inventory that is held in the supply chain. As many of our products are designed into customer applications with relatively long lives, such value is only realized when the end-market demand is created and the supply chain sells the inventory to the end customer. We define end-market demand as the net dollar amount of our products, licensing revenue and other services delivered to our direct (non-distributor) customers and by our distributors to their customers. We are able to calculate end-market demand based on information that our distributors provide us about their product shipments to their customers and inventory holdings. The value of end-market demand from our distributors is calculated as the net transaction value of these shipments. We believe that our end-market demand metric reflects true end-market demand based on when product is sold to direct customers or by our distributors to an end customer. We believe the use of end-market demand is also important to investors and users of our financial statements as it reflects the final outcome of our sales activities whereas our GAAP net sales are based on estimates made earlier in (or before the end of) the process of creating and fulfilling demand is complete. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires. Management uses end-market demand to manage and assess the profitability of our business and when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose end-market demand metric because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it provides better information regarding end-market demand for our products. Therefore, we believe that it is useful to investors for us to disclose end-market demand. Our determination of end-market demand metric might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions on manufacturing activities, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, IT security remediation costs, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, losses on the settlement of debt, and gains related to equity investments. For the third quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Generally, gross margin fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels.

Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading "Supplemental Financial Information"), and repurchases or issuances of

shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the March 2021 quarter between $140 and $150 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).
