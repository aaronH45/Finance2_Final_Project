Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

The Compensation & Talent Management Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of CSX Corporation (“CSX” or the “Company”) undertook a review of the annual compensation of the Company’s named executive officers. In recognition of their individual performance achievements, overall responsibilities and functional experience, and in an effort to retain and motivate executive leadership in the short- and long-term, on January 22, 2021, the Committee approved increases to the annual base salaries and target annual bonus opportunities for Kevin S. Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jamie J. Boychuk, Executive Vice President - Operations and Nathan D. Goldman, Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. The changes were as follows: (i) for Mr. Boone, a base salary increase from $475,000 to $700,000 and a target annual bonus opportunity increase from $427,500 to $700,000; (ii) for Mr. Boychuk, a base salary increase from $500,000 to $700,000 and a target annual bonus opportunity increase from $450,000 to $700,000; and (iii) for Mr. Goldman, a base salary increase from $500,000 to $550,000 and a target annual bonus opportunity increase from $450,000 to $495,000. These adjustments are effective as January 1, 2021.  

On January 22, 2021, the Committee also exercised its discretionary authority under the Company’s 2020 Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) to approve payouts to each of the Company’s named executive officers at 75% of 2020 target levels. In determining the payout for the MICP, the Committee not only considered financial and safety performance under the plan, but also the Company’s operational and ESG performance, as well as efforts to effectively manage through the pandemic, protect employees and ensure the Company’s ability to fulfill its vital role in the nation’s supply chain.
