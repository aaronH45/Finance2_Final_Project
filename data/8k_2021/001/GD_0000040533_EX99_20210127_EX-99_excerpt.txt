January 27, 2021

•Strong fourth quarter performance in COVID environment

•$3.9 billion net cash provided by operating activities for the year, 122% of net earnings

•Record-high backlog of $89.5 billion

RESTON, Va. – General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported quarterly net earnings of $1 billion, or $3.49 per diluted share, on $10.5 billion in revenue. For the full year, net earnings were $3.2 billion, or $11.00 per diluted share, on revenue of $37.9 billion. 

On a sequential basis, both net earnings and earnings per share (EPS) were up 20% from the previous quarter. Operating margin was 12.3% in the quarter, up 90 basis points sequentially and up 20 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Backlog grew 9.8% in the quarter to a record-high $89.5 billion.

“Our continued focus on operating performance and on protecting the health and safety of our employees contributed to strong sequential improvements in earnings, margin and cash flow,” said Phebe N. Novakovic, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our defense segments continued to capture significant awards, leading to a record-high backlog, while our aerospace segment not only remained very profitable, but actually improved its margins throughout the year, even as the broader business aviation industry contracted severely due to the pandemic.”

Company-wide operating margin was 12.3%, up 90 basis points from the prior quarter. Aerospace margin was 16.5%, up 220 basis points from the prior quarter. 

Cash

Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter totaled $2.6 billion, or 256% of net earnings. For the year, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.9 billion, or 122% of net earnings. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $2.2 billion for the quarter, a 221% conversion of net earnings, and $2.9 billion for the year, a 91% conversion of net earnings. During the quarter, the company reduced its net debt by $1.7

Backlog

Orders remained strong across the company with a consolidated book-to-bill of 1.8-to-1 for the quarter and 1.1-to-1 for the year. In addition to backlog of $89.5 billion, management’s estimate of additional value in unfunded indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options was $45.2 billion at year-end. Total estimated contract value, representing the sum of all backlog components was $134.7 billion, up 6.7% for the year. 

Significant awards in the fourth quarter included a $9.5 billion option exercise from the U.S. Navy for construction and test of the first two Columbia-class submarines; $4.4 billion maximum potential value contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to provide cloud solutions for Office 365 deployment and migration; a $3.3 billion maximum potential value contract from the U.S. State Department to provide business process support services; a $695 million contract from the U.S. Army to provide information technology and professional services; $620 million for several key contracts for classified customers; a $405 million initial task order on a $4.3 billion maximum potential value contract to upgrade Abrams tanks for the Army; a $230 million initial task order on an Army contract with a maximum potential contract value of $1.2 billion to produce Stryker Initial Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (IM-SHORAD) vehicles; $375 million from the Navy to provide lead yard services for the Virginia-class submarine program; and $265 million from the Navy for maintenance and repair services for three ship classes.

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION - (UNAUDITED)

DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS

(a)Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity as of year end.

(b)Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity as of year end.

(c)Book value per share is calculated as total equity divided by total outstanding shares as of year end. 

(d)Includes independent research and development and Aerospace product-development costs.

(e)Return on sales is calculated as net earnings divided by revenue.

(f)Return on equity is calculated by dividing net earnings by our average equity during the year.

(g)We believe earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a useful measure for investors because it provides another measure of our profitability and our ability to service our debt. We calculate EBITDA by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to net earnings. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA is net earnings. 

(h)We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to free cash flow from operations is net cash provided by operating activities.

(i)We believe return on invested capital (ROIC) is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as net earnings plus after-tax interest and amortization expense, calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss. ROIC excludes goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to net operating profit after taxes is net earnings.

(a)The estimated potential contract value includes work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, including options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase new aircraft and aircraft services. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. For IDIQ contracts, we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value. 

(b)Effective December 31, 2020, we have reorganized our Mission Systems and Information Technology business units into a single reporting unit — Technologies — to better reflect the way we are running the business, the overlap and commonality of customers, and customer demand for end-to-end solutions melding technology, hardware and software.
