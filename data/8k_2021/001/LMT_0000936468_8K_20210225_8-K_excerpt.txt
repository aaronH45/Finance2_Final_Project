Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On February 25, 2021, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Lockheed Martin Corporation (“Lockheed Martin” or the “Corporation”), acting upon the recommendation of the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”), approved the Lockheed Martin Corporation 2021 Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2021 MICP”), effective January 1, 2021, to replace the existing Lockheed Martin Corporation Amended and Restated 2006 Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2006 MICP”). The 2021 MICP eliminates provisions in the 2006 MICP that were intended to qualify MICP payments as performance-based compensation subject to an exemption to the deductibility limit of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. This performance-based compensation exemption to Section 162(m)’s deductibility limit was repealed in 2017. The 2021 MICP also aligns certain administrative provisions with the Corporation’s broad-based incentive plans. No changes were made to the overall annual incentive plan design for the CEO or the other named executive officers identified in the Corporation's 2020 proxy statement. 

The 2021 MICP provides executives the opportunity to earn annual cash incentives based on performance measured against pre-established performance goals. The Board of Directors may make an upward or downward (including to zero) adjustment to the proposed amount of incentive compensation award otherwise payable to the participant in its discretion. Consistent with the 2006 MICP, under the terms of the 2021 MICP, the Committee retains discretion in setting target levels for participants, choosing and approving metrics, assigning weighting to the metrics, and assessing performance. Likewise, similar to the 2006 MICP, under the terms of the 2021 MICP, the CEO’s bonus and the bonus of each of the other NEOs cannot exceed 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, of adjusted net cash flow from operations for the plan year. 

The foregoing description of the 2021 MICP is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the 2021 MICP, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
