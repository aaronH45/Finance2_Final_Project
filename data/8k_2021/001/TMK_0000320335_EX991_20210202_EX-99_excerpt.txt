 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net operating income, a non-GAAP(1) financial measure, has been used consistently by Globe Life’s management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized investment gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income. Management believes an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company’s business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

The following table represents Globe Life's operating summary for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:

MANAGEMENT VS. GAAP MEASURES

Shareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, and book value per share, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, are non-GAAP measures that are utilized by management to view the business without the effect of unrealized gains or losses which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates associated with the available-for-sale portfolio. Management views the business in this manner because the Company does not intend to sell, nor is it likely that management will be required to sell, the fixed maturities prior to their anticipated recovery. It creates more meaningful trends than can be more easily identified without the fluctuations. Shareholders' equity and book value per share are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Calculated using average shareholders' equity for the measurement period. 

INSURANCE OPERATIONS—comparing Q4 2020 with Q4 2019: 

Life insurance accounted for 69% of the Company’s insurance underwriting margin for the quarter and 70% of total premium revenue. 

Health insurance accounted for 30% of the Company's insurance underwriting margin for the quarter and 30% of total premium revenue. 

Net sales of life insurance increased 23% for the quarter, while net health sales declined 11%.

INSURANCE UNDERWRITING INCOME

Insurance underwriting margin is management’s measure of profitability of the Company's life, health, and annuity segments’ underwriting performance, and consists of premiums less policy obligations, commissions and other acquisition expenses. Insurance underwriting income is the sum of the insurance underwriting margins of the life, health, and annuity segments, plus other income, less insurance administrative expenses. It excludes the investment segment, Parent Company expense, stock compensation expense and income taxes. Management believes this information helps provide a better understanding of the business and a more meaningful analysis of underwriting results by distribution channel. Insurance underwriting income, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of net operating income, which is reconciled to net income in the Results of Operations section above.

The following table summarizes Globe Life's insurance underwriting income by segment for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The lower life insurance underwriting margins in the fourth quarter of 2020 are primarily attributed to approximately $27 million of COVID-related claims in the current quarter.

Administrative expenses were $63 million, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter. The ratio of administrative expenses to premium was 6.5%, compared with 6.7% for the year-ago quarter.

INVESTMENTS 

Management uses excess investment income as the measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest on debt. We also view excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate performance of the investment segment, since it takes into consideration our stock repurchase program. 

The following table summarizes Globe Life's investment income, excess investment income, and excess investment income per diluted common share.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Interest on net policy liabilities is a component of total policyholder benefits, a GAAP measure.

Net investment income increased 3.3%, while average invested assets increased 5.8%. Required interest on net policy liabilities increased 5.6%, while average net policy liabilities increased 4.5%. The weighted average discount rate for the net policy liabilities was 5.7% and was in line with the year-ago quarter.

The composition of the investment portfolio at book value at December 31, 2020 is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) On January 1, 2020, the Company prospectively adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. For available-for-sale fixed maturities, the standard removed the loss impairment methodology of a direct write-down of the amortized cost and replaced it with allowances for credit losses. As of December 31, 2020, fixed maturities at amortized cost were $17.2 billion, net of $3 million for allowance for credit losses.

(2) Includes $385 million of investments accounted for under the fair value option which have a cost of $374 million as of December 31, 2020.

Fixed maturities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses by asset class as of December 31, 2020 are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Below are fixed maturities available for sale by amortized cost, allowance for credit losses, and fair value at December 31, 2020 and the corresponding amounts of net unrealized gains recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, 95% of fixed maturities (96% at fair value) were rated “investment grade.” The fixed maturity portfolio earned an annual taxable equivalent effective yield of 5.29% during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with 5.41% in the year-ago quarter.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SHARE REPURCHASE:

During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $123 million and an average share price of $88.55. 

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 4.5 million shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $380 million and an average share price of $85.24.

LIQUIDITY/CAPITAL: 

Globe Life's operations consist primarily of writing basic protection life and supplemental health insurance policies which generate strong and stable cash flows. These cash flows are not impacted by volatile equity markets. Liquidity at the Parent Company is sufficient to meet additional capital needs, if any, of the insurance companies.

EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2021: 

Globe Life projects that net operating income per share will be in the range of $7.16 to $7.56 for the year ending December 31, 2021. The decline from previous guidance is due primarily to an increase in estimated future COVID death claims.

NON-GAAP MEASURES: 

In this news release, Globe Life includes non-GAAP measures to enhance investors' understanding of management's view of the business. The non-GAAP measures are not a substitute for GAAP, but rather a supplement to increase transparency by providing broader perspective. Globe Life's definitions of non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies' definitions. More detailed financial information, including various GAAP and non-GAAP measurements, is located at https://investors.globelifeinsurance.com on the Investors page under “Financial Reports and Other Financial Information."
