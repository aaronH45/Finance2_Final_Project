Dear Mike,

It is with great sadness that I submit this resignation from the AutoNation Board of Directors effective January 19, 2021. It has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve on the AutoNation Board and work alongside such a committed group of fellow Board members and superb management team.

Please know that I have NO issues with the Board, management or any business matters. You have one of the finest management teams that I have ever had the privilege of working with, and I am grateful for having had the opportunity to serve on the AutoNation Board.

Respectfully,

/s/ Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr.
