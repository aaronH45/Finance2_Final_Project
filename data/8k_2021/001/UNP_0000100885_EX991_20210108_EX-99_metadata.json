We use adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating ratio, as applicable, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, operating expenses and operating ratio, as indicators of operating performance."
