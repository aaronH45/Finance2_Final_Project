Consolidated Results  

For the three months ended December 31, 2020, earnings were $0.80 per share, compared to $0.54 per share in the same period of 2019, an increase of $0.26 per share. Results for the Regulated Business increased $0.01 per share and results from the Market-Based Business increased $0.22 per share. Parent Company results improved $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. Consolidated results reflect a $0.02 per share benefit from depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting in 2020 and the loss of $0.19 per share on the disposal of Keystone Clearwater Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2019.  

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, earnings were $3.91 per share, compared to $3.43 per share in the same period of 2019, an increase of $0.48 per share. Results from the Regulated Business increased $0.33 per share, while the Market-Based Businesses’ results improved $0.24 per share compared to 2019. Parent Company results were $0.09 per share lower in 2020 as compared to 2019, due primarily to higher interest expense. Regulated results are higher from the impact of increased revenues from new rates in effect as well as earnings from acquisitions, offset somewhat by higher operation and maintenance costs and depreciation resulting from growth in the business. Regulated results also reflect an estimated $0.10 per share favorable impact year-over-year due to warmer and drier than normal weather across several of the Company’s subsidiaries in 2020 and unusually wet weather conditions in 2019. And finally, regulated results reflect a $0.06 per share benefit from depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting in 2020. Market-Based Business results improved compared to 2019 from the addition of installations for the Military Services Group and new partnerships and price increases in the Homeowner Services Group. As compared to 2019, improved results in 2020 reflect the $0.19 per share loss on the disposal of Keystone Clearwater Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2019. Market-Based Business and consolidated results also include an estimated $0.02 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the Homeowner Services Group.  

In 2020, the Company made capital investments of $1.9 billion, including $1.8 billion dedicated primarily to infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses and $135 million for regulated acquisitions.  

Regulated Businesses  

The Regulated Businesses’ net income was $154 million and $715 million in 2020, compared to $152 million and $654 million in 2019 for the fourth quarter and year to date period, respectively. The increases are primarily due to additional authorized revenues from infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth, offset somewhat by higher O&M expenses and depreciation to support regulated acquisitions and other growth.  

 PRESS RELEASE   2   www.amwater.com  

For the quarter, Regulated Businesses revenue increased approximately $16 million from additional authorized revenues from infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth, partially offset by a decrease in other operating revenues due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. O&M expenses were higher by $19 million to support regulated acquisitions and other growth, while depreciation increased $10 million, mainly related to infrastructure investment growth.  

For the year, Regulated Businesses revenue increased approximately $161 million from additional authorized revenues from infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth and an estimated $23 million from warmer than normal weather in 2020 and unusually wet weather conditions during 2019, partially offset by a decrease in other operating revenues due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. O&M expenses were higher by $76 million to support growth in the Regulated Businesses and depreciation increased by $33 million, mainly related to infrastructure investment growth.  

The Company expects additional annualized revenues of approximately $56 million from general rate cases, including step increases, and approximately $95 million from infrastructure surcharges that have been completed. The Company is in various stages of general rate cases in four jurisdictions and filed for infrastructure surcharges in two jurisdictions, for a total annualized revenue request of approximately $208 million.  

For the year 2020, the Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) was 34.3%, compared to 34.5% for 2019.  

Market-Based Businesses  

In the fourth quarter of 2020, net income in the Market-Based Businesses was $23 million, compared to a net loss of $18 million for the same period in 2019. 2019 results include a loss of $35 million on the disposal of Keystone Clearwater Solutions.  

Net income in the Market-Based Businesses in 2020 was $91 million, compared to $46 million for the same period in 2019. Military Services Group benefited from the addition of two installations (Joint Base San Antonio and U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York), which were awarded in the third quarter of 2019. The Company became fully operational on these installations as of June 1, 2020. In addition, results from the Homeowner Services Group were higher on new partnerships and price increases in 2020. Partially offsetting these increases were estimated impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on the Homeowner Services Group from increased claims that likely have resulted from more work from home activity. Lastly, 2019 results include the previously mentioned $35 million loss on the disposal of Keystone Clearwater Solutions.  

Dividends  

On December 10, 2020, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on March 2, 2021, to all shareholders of record as of February 8, 2021.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

This press release includes a presentation of adjusted Regulated O&M efficiency ratio, which excludes from its calculation estimated purchased water and other revenues and purchased water expenses, the impact of certain activities related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, and the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes. This item constitutes a “non-GAAP financial measure” under SEC rules. The items discussed above were excluded from the calculation as they are not reflective of management’s ability to increase the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses.  

This item is derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure supplements and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP disclosures and should be considered as an addition to, and not a substitute for, any GAAP measure. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to the Company’s investors because it directly measures improvement in the operating performance and efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. The Company’s adjusted Regulated O&M efficiency ratio is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of calculation and may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures, and thus it may have significant limitations on its use.  

Set forth in this release is a table that reconciles each of the components used to calculate adjusted Regulated O&M efficiency ratio to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  

 PRESS RELEASE   3   www.amwater.com  

Management is unable to present a reconciliation of adjustments to the components of the forward-looking Regulated O&M efficiency ratio without unreasonable effort because management cannot reliably predict the nature, amount or probable significance of all of the adjustments for future periods; however, these adjustments may, individually or in the aggregate, cause the non-GAAP financial measure component of the forward-looking ratio to differ significantly from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
