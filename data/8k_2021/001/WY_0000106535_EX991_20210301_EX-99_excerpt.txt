Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by our use of certain words in such statements, including without limitation words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “committed,” “continue,” “continued,” “could,” “forecast,” “growing,” “estimate,” “outlook,” “goal,” “will,” “plan,” “expect,” “sustainable,” “maintain,” “target,” “would” and similar words and terms and phrases using such terms and words. Depictions or illustrations that constitute forward-looking statements may be identified by graphs, charts or other illustrations indicating expected or predicted occurrences of events, trends, conditions, performance or achievements at a future date or during future time periods. We may refer to assumptions, goals or targets, or we may reference expected performance through, or events to occur by or at, a future date, and such references may also constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions. The realization of our expectations and the accuracy of our assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and often are beyond the company’s control. These and other factors could cause one or more of our expectations to be unmet, one or more of our assumptions to be materially inaccurate or actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements, or all of the foregoing. Such uncertainties and other factors include, without limitation: the effect of general economic conditions, including employment rates, interest rate levels, housing starts, general availability of financing for home mortgages and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar; the effects of COVID-19 and other viral or disease outbreaks and their potential impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and future prospects; market demand for the company's products, including market demand for our timberland properties with higher and better uses, which is related to, among other factors, the strength of the various U.S. business segments and U.S. and international economic conditions; changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, and the Canadian dollar, and the relative value of the euro to the yen; restrictions on international trade and tariffs imposed on imports or exports; the availability and cost of shipping and transportation; economic activity in Asia, especially Japan and China; performance of our manufacturing operations, including maintenance and capital requirements; potential disruptions in our manufacturing operations; the level of competition from domestic and foreign producers; our operational excellence initiatives; the successful and timely execution and integration of our strategic acquisitions, including our ability to realize expected benefits and synergies, and the successful and timely execution of our strategic divestitures, each of which is subject to a number of risks and conditions beyond our control including, but not limited to, timing and required regulatory approvals or the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to a termination of any acquisition or divestiture transaction under the terms of the governing transaction agreements; raw material availability and prices; the effect of weather; changes in global or regional climate conditions and governmental response to such changes; the risk of loss from fires, floods, windstorms, hurricanes, pest infestation and other natural disasters, including the 2020 fire outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest; energy prices; transportation and labor availability and costs; federal tax policies; the effect of forestry, land use, environmental and other governmental regulations; legal proceedings; performance of pension fund investments and related derivatives; the effect of timing of employee retirements and changes in the market price of our common stock on charges for share-based compensation; the accuracy of our estimates of costs and expenses related to contingent liabilities and charges related to casualty losses; changes in accounting principles; and other risks and uncertainties identified in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as those set forth from time to time in our other public statements, reports, registration statements, prospectuses, information statements and other filings with the SEC. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties that might affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and, consequently, our descriptions of such risks and uncertainties should not be considered exhaustive. There is no guarantee that any of the events anticipated by these forward-looking statements will occur, and if any of the events do occur, there is no guarantee what effect they will have on the company's business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and future prospects. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Nothing on our website is intended to be included or incorporated by reference into, or made a part of, this presentation. Also included in this presentation are certain non-GAAP financial measures, which management believes complement the financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes such non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly named or captioned non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. A reconciliation of each presented non-GAAP measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the appendices to this presentation.​
