DANAHER REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2020 RESULTS

WASHINGTON, D.C., January 28, 2021 -- Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR) (the “Company”) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. All results in this release reflect only continuing operations unless otherwise noted.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, net earnings were $1.2 billion, or $1.66 per diluted common share which represents a 55.0% year-over-year increase from the comparable 2019 period. 

Non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share for the fourth quarter 2020 were $2.08 which represents a 62.5% increase over the comparable 2019 period. For the fourth quarter 2020, revenues increased 39.0% year-over-year to $6.8 billion, with 15.5% non-GAAP core revenue growth including Cytiva. 

For the full year 2020, net earnings were $3.6 billion, or $4.89 per diluted common share which represents a 50.0% year-over-year increase. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share for 2020 were $6.31 per share, which represents a 43.0% increase over the comparable 2019 amount. Revenues for the full year 2020 increased 24.5% to $22.3 billion, with 9.5% non-GAAP core revenue growth including Cytiva.

Operating cash flow for the full year 2020 was $6.2 billion, representing a 70.0% increase year-over-year, and non-GAAP free cash flow was $5.4 billion, representing a 79.0% increase year-over-year.

For the first quarter 2021 the Company anticipates that non-GAAP core revenue growth including Cytiva will be in the mid to high-teens range.

For the full year 2021, the Company anticipates non-GAAP core revenue growth including Cytiva will be in the low-double digit range.

Rainer M. Blair, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “For the full year 2020, we achieved nearly 10% core revenue growth including Cytiva, strong margin expansion, and more than $5 billion of free cash flow. But our financial results only tell part of the story. Despite many unforeseen challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our team turned the challenges we faced into impactful opportunities to support our customers and the global community. We’re proud to play a pivotal role in the fight against COVID-19, and our 2020 results are a testament to our team’s commitment and perseverance.”

Blair added, “2020 was also a transformative year for Danaher with the addition of Cytiva—the largest acquisition in our Company’s history and one that has strengthened our position as a global science and technology leader. Going forward, we believe the combination of our portfolio, innovative team, and strong balance sheet—all powered by the Danaher Business System—positions us to deliver sustainable, long-term shareholder value for many years to come.”

Notes to Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures

A Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the following historical periods ($ in millions) (only the pretax amounts set forth below are reflected in the amortization line item above):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

B Pretax costs incurred for fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue related to the acquisition of Cytiva in the three-month period ended December 31, 2020, ($49 million pretax as reported in this line item, $39 million after-tax) and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs related to the acquisition of Cytiva for the year ended December 31, 2020, ($568 million pretax as reported in this line item, $450 million after-tax). Pretax costs incurred for transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs related to the acquisition of Cytiva in the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, ($30 million pretax as reported in this line item, $27 million after-tax) and the year ended December 31, 2019, ($93 million pretax as reported in this line item, $84 million after-tax). The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a given period.

C Loss on early extinguishment of debt resulting from “make-whole” payments associated with the retirement of the 2022 Euronotes ($26 million pretax as reported in this line item, $20 million after-tax) in both the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2020 and the 2020 U.S. Notes and the 2020 Assumed Pall Notes ($7 million pretax as reported in this line item, $5 million after-tax) in both the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2019.

D Loss on partial settlement of a defined benefit plan resulting from the transfer of a portion of Danaher's non-U.S. pension liabilities to a third party ($7 million pretax as reported in this line item, $6 million after-tax) in both the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2019. 

E Pretax impairment charges related to a facility in the Diagnostics segment, trade name and other intangible assets in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2020 ($8 million pretax as reported in this line item, $6 million after-tax) and trade names in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment in the third quarter of 2020 ($14 million pretax as reported in this line item, $11 million after-tax). 

F Pretax fair value (gains) and losses on the Company's equity and limited partnership investments recorded in the three-month period ($31 million pretax as reported in this line item, $24 million after-tax) and year ended December 31, 2020 ($18 million pretax as reported in this line item, $14 million after-tax).

G Pretax gain on the sale of certain product lines in the Life Sciences segment in the year ended December 31, 2020 ($455 million pretax as reported in this line item, $305 million after-tax).

H This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the preceding line items of the table. In addition, the footnotes above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment item. Danaher estimates the tax effect of each adjustment item by applying Danaher’s overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment. The MCPS dividends are not tax deductible and therefore the tax effect of the adjustments does not include any tax impact of the MCPS dividends. 

I Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2020, include the impact of net discrete tax gains of $85 million (or $0.12 per diluted common share), related primarily to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions from audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by a higher tax rate associated with the gain on the divestiture of certain product lines in the Life Sciences segment and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2019, include the impact of net discrete tax gains of $12 million (or $0.02 per diluted common share) and discrete tax charges of $215 million (or $0.29 per diluted common share), respectively. The discrete tax matters for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2019 relate primarily to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions and audit settlements, net of the release of valuation allowances associated with certain foreign tax credits and tax benefits resulting from a change in law. The Company anticipates excess tax benefits from stock compensation of approximately $7 million per quarter and therefore excludes benefits in excess of this amount in the calculation of adjusted diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations. 

J In March 2019, the Company issued $1.65 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of 4.75% MCPS. In May 2020, the Company issued $1.72 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of 5.0% MCPS. Dividends on the 4.75% and 5.0% MCPS are payable on a cumulative basis at an annual rate of 4.75% and 5.0%, respectively, on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. Unless earlier converted, each share of 4.75% MCPS will automatically convert on April 15, 2022 into between 6.6563 and 8.1538 shares of Danaher’s common stock, subject to further anti-dilution adjustments. Unless earlier converted, each share of 5.0% MCPS will automatically convert on April 15, 2023 into between 5.0081 and 6.1349 shares of Danaher’s common stock, subject to further anti-dilution adjustments. The number of shares of Danaher’s common stock issuable on conversion of the MCPS will be determined based on the VWAP per share of the Company's common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading day immediately before April 15, 2022 and April 15, 2023 for the 4.75% and 5.0% MCPS, respectively. For the purposes of calculating 

DANAHER CORPORATION

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

(continued)

adjusted earnings per share, the Company has excluded the paid and anticipated MCPS cash dividends and assumed the “if-converted” method of share dilution (the incremental shares of common stock deemed outstanding applying the “if-converted” method of calculating share dilution are referred to as the “Converted Shares”.)

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures

Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth in this file should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation’s (“Danaher” or the “Company”) results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors to:

•with respect to adjusted diluted net earnings per common share, understand the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers; 

•with respect to core sales, identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our sales performance with prior and future periods and to our peers; and

•with respect to free cash flow, understand Danaher’s ability to generate cash without external financings, strengthen its balance sheet, invest in its business and grow its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities (although a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not take into account the Company’s debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures, and as a result the entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures).

We also present core sales on a basis that includes sales attributable to Cytiva (formerly the Biopharma Business of General Electric Company’s (“GE”) Life Sciences business), which Danaher acquired from GE on March 31, 2020. Historically Danaher has calculated core sales solely on a basis that excludes sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. However, given Cytiva’s significant size and historical core sales growth rate, in each case compared to Danaher’s existing businesses, management believes it is appropriate to also present core sales on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. Management believes this presentation provides useful information to investors by demonstrating the impact Cytiva has on the Company’s current growth profile, rather than waiting to demonstrate such impact 12 months after the acquisition when Cytiva would normally have been included in Danaher’s core sales calculation. Danaher calculates period-to-period core sales growth including Cytiva by adding to the baseline period sales Cytiva’s historical sales from such period (when it was owned by GE, as applicable), net of the sales of the divested product lines and also adding the Cytiva sales to the current period.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance, and uses core sales and non-GAAP measures similar to adjusted diluted net earnings per common share and free cash flow in the Company’s executive compensation program.

•The items we exclude from adjusted diluted net earnings per common share are excluded for the following reasons:

◦Amortization of Intangible Assets. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to sales generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. 

◦Restructuring Charges. We exclude costs incurred pursuant to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different (in terms of the size, strategic nature and planning requirements, as well as the inconsistent frequency, of such plans) from the ongoing productivity improvements that result from application of the Danaher Business System. Because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and we believe are not indicative of Danaher’s ongoing operating costs in a given period, we exclude these costs to facilitate a more consistent comparison of operating results over time. 

◦Other Adjustments. With respect to the other items excluded (as applicable), we exclude these items because they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. 

•With respect to adjusted average common stock and common equivalent shares outstanding, Danaher’s Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS”) will mandatorily convert into Danaher common stock on the mandatory conversion date, which is expected to be April 15, 2022 and April 15, 2023 for the 4.75% and 5.0% MCPS, respectively (unless converted or redeemed earlier in accordance with the terms of the applicable certificate of designations). In this file, we use this measure to present the earnings per share-related non-GAAP measures on a basis that assumes the MCPS had already been converted as of the beginning of the applicable period (and accordingly also exclude the dividends that were actually paid on the MCPS during such period, since such dividends would no longer be paid once the MCPS convert). We believe this presentation provides useful information to investors by helping them understand what the net impact will be on Danaher’s earnings per share-related non-GAAP measures once the MCPS convert into Danaher common stock.

•With respect to core sales and core sales including Cytiva, (1) we exclude the impact of currency translation because it is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) we exclude the effect of acquisitions (other than Cytiva, in the case of core sales including Cytiva) and divested product lines because the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.

•With respect to the free cash flow, we exclude payments for additions to property, plant and equipment (net of the proceeds from capital disposals) to demonstrate the amount of operating cash flow for the period that remains after accounting for the Company’s capital expenditure requirements.

•With respect to forecasted core sales and forecasted core sales including Cytiva, we do not reconcile these measures to the comparable GAAP measure because of the inherent difficulty in predicting and estimating the future impact and timing of currency translation, acquisitions and divested product lines, which would be reflected in any forecasted GAAP revenue.
