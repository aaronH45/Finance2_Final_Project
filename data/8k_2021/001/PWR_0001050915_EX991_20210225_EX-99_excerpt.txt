HOUSTON – Feb. 25, 2021 - Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $2.91 billion compared to revenues of $3.11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, and net income attributable to common stock was $170.1 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net income attributable to common stock of $118.1 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $1.22 for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $0.93 for the fourth quarter of 2019.  

“Quanta’s utility solutions and delivery model continue to produce world-class execution and performance, which drove fourth quarter results that exceeded our expectations and completed a solid year for Quanta that included improved profitability and record earnings per share and backlog, despite the unprecedented conditions caused by the global pandemic,” said Duke Austin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quanta Services. “We believe our 2020 results reflect the dedication and operational excellence of our people, the resilience of our business and the sound execution of our strategic initiatives.”

“Our 2021 expectations reflect growth in revenues, net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. More importantly, we continue to believe there is opportunity to drive multi-year revenue and earnings growth by focusing on our base business and continuing to provide infrastructure solutions that support our customers’ efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency and connectivity through modernization. Incrementally, we believe our solutions play an important role in enabling policies and goals aimed at transitioning towards a carbon neutral economy over the long-term, which many of our utility customers are leading. We are successfully executing on our strategic growth initiatives, which, coupled with our strong financial profile, position us well to continue to deliver value to stockholders.”  

Favorably impacting the fourth quarter of 2020 were a $45.1 million release of a valuation allowance against foreign tax credits as a result of a financial restructure during the fourth quarter of 2020 and an $8.2 million benefit related to the release of tax contingencies upon expiration of certain statute of limitations periods. Certain other items also impacted the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019 results and are reflected as adjustments in the calculation of Quanta’s adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure). These items are further described in the accompanying tables reconciling adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock. Quanta completed seven acquisitions during each of 2020 and 2019, and the results of the acquired businesses are included in Quanta’s consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. For further information on the items that impacted comparability of 2020 and 2019, see the footnotes to the accompanying tables presenting Supplemental Segment Data and reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (non-GAAP measures) to their comparable GAAP financial measures.  

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS  

   •    

Completed Two Acquisitions During the Fourth Quarter - During the fourth quarter, Quanta completed the acquisition of a business that primarily provides aviation services for the utility industry, principally in California. Additionally, Quanta completed the acquisition of a company that provides heavy civil, industrial and energy construction and maintenance services in the western United States. Quanta believes the services provided by these businesses can support its electric power and underground utility operations in the western United States.  

   •    

Stock Repurchased - During the fourth quarter of 2020, Quanta repurchased $49.9 million of its outstanding common stock in the open market, acquiring 0.7 million shares, and during the year ended December 31, 2020, Quanta acquired a total of 6.7 million shares of its common stock for $249.9 million. From December 31, 2020 through February 24, 2021, Quanta also repurchased $7.0 million of its outstanding common stock in the open market, acquiring approximately 100,000 shares. As of February 24, 2021, Quanta had $529.8 million of availability remaining under its current stock repurchase authorizations.

   •    

Increased Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% - In December 2020, Quanta’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of $0.06 per share, or a rate of $0.24 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a 20% increase from Quanta’s prior quarterly cash dividend paid in October 2020.  

LATIN AMERICA  

As previously communicated, the company has been pursuing the exit of its Latin American (LATAM) operations, which management believes has been substantially completed. Quanta’s LATAM operations generated operating losses of $27.1 million (including $7.0 million of asset impairments and $2.7 million of severance and restructuring charges), or $0.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared to operating losses of $3.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2019. These operations have been significantly impacted by the prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, and that, in part, has led the company to accelerate various contract terminations and other activities in order to expedite Quanta’s cessation of operations in the region, which in turn negatively impacted Quanta’s results. As of December, 31, 2020, there were only a few contracts remaining to complete or exit, and as a result Quanta’s LATAM financial results are not expected to be material in 2021, and therefore we do not expect to separately present LATAM financial results for future periods.  

SEGMENT NAME CHANGES  

As of December 31, 2020, Quanta changed the name of its Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment to Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions and the name of its Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment to Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions. There was no change to the composition of the segments. With respect to both segments, we believe utilizing “Solutions” more accurately describes the value-creating and collaborative approach we take to working with our customers. Additionally, we believe Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions is more reflective of the strategic changes we have made over the past five years to reposition the segment towards resilient business services to our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial customers, which are generally more visible and recurring in nature and are driven by safety, reliability and environmental regulations.  

QUANTA’S RESPONSE TO THE EFFECT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC  

Quanta continues to take proactive measures to protect the health and safety of its employees through the implementation of its pandemic plan and is operating based on the guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Quanta also continues to implement initiatives such as specialized training, social distancing, additional protective equipment for its employees in the field, and additional sanitizing measures for offices, vehicles and equipment. Quanta has also reduced non-essential business travel, applied work-from-home policies where appropriate and developed other human resource-related guidance to help employees stay safe and healthy. To date, Quanta has not experienced any meaningful impact on the availability of its workforce or key personnel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, Quanta continues to implement its business continuity plan and collaborate with customers to minimize potential service disruptions and to proactively anticipate how COVID-19 may impact the company’s operations.  

-MORE-   

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Quanta’s operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and actions taken by Quanta’s customers and suppliers and by domestic and international governments in response to the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result, Quanta continues to actively monitor the current environment for risks related to the pandemic in order to prepare and respond accordingly.  

RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019  

Revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $11.20 billion compared to revenues of $12.11 billion in the year ended December 31, 2019, and net income attributable to common stock was $445.6 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net income attributable to common stock of $402.0 million, or $2.73 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $3.82 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.33 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by operating losses associated with Quanta’s LATAM operations of $74.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share and adjusted operating losses of $64.3 million, or $0.44 per adjusted diluted earnings per share. Both diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year ended December 31, 2019 were impacted by operating losses associated with Quanta’s LATAM operations of $85.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, which included a $79.2 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, charge associated with a terminated telecommunications project in Peru, partially offset by the recognition of $60.3 million ($43.9 million after-tax), or $0.30 per diluted share, of earnings related to the recognition of previously deferred earnings on an electric transmission project in Canada. With the exception of adjusted diluted earnings per share, also impacting the financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was a $13.0 million ($20.7 million with associated tax benefits), or $0.14 per diluted share, gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the sale of Quanta’s investment in the same electric transmission project in Canada. For further information on other items impacting the fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, please refer to the footnotes to the accompanying tables presenting Supplemental Segment Data and reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (non-GAAP measures) to their comparable GAAP financial measures.

OUTLOOK  

The long-term outlook for Quanta’s business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, project timing, execution challenges and other factors have impacted the company’s historical results, and may impact Quanta’s future financial results. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted certain of Quanta’s operations and various markets where Quanta operates, which has created additional uncertainty. Therefore, Quanta’s financial outlook reflects management’s effort to align these uncertainties with the backlog the company is executing on and the opportunities expected to materialize during 2021.  

Prior to the company’s conference call, management will post a summary of Quanta’s 2021 guidance expectations with additional commentary in the “Financial Info” area of the Investor Relations section of Quanta’s website at http://investors.quantaservices.com.  

The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially. Quanta expects 2021 revenues to range between $11.95 billion and $12.35 billion, net income attributable to common stock to range between $458 million and $531 million, diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to range between $3.16 and $3.66 and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) to range between $4.02 and $4.52. EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) is expected to range between $1.00 billion and $1.11 billion, and adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) is expected to range between $1.09 billion and $1.19 billion. Additionally, Quanta’s full year free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) expectations are between $400 million and $600 million.  

As discussed previously in this earnings release, as of December, 31, 2020, there were only a few contracts remaining to complete or exit within Quanta’s LATAM operations. As a result, the Latin American financial results are not expected to be material in 2021, and therefore we do not expect to separately present LATAM financial results for future periods.  

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The financial measures not prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) that are utilized in this press release are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta’s performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta’s operating results with those of its competitors. These measures should be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, results prepared in conformity with GAAP.  

Please see the accompanying tables for reconciliations of the following non-GAAP financial measures for Quanta’s results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and full-year 2021 expectations: adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) to diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP measures) to net income attributable to common stock and free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) to net cash provided by operating activities.

Supplemental Segment Data 

For the Three and Twelve Months Ended 

December 31, 2020 and 2019 

(In thousands, except percentages) 

(Unaudited)    

(a) Latin American revenues and operating losses have been presented separately as a result of Quanta’s conclusion to pursue an exit of its operations in Latin America. The results for these operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were primarily associated with early contract terminations and project close out costs, cost adjustments on certain remaining projects and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the recognition of $7.0 million of asset impairments and $2.7 million of severance and restructuring charges. The results for these operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 included a $79.2 million charge associated with the terminated telecommunications project in Peru, which consisted of a $48.8 million decrease in revenues and a $30.4 million increase in cost of services.  

As of December 31, 2020, Quanta believes the exit activities have been substantially completed with only a few contracts remaining to complete or exit. As a result, the Latin American financial results are not expected to be material in 2021, and therefore we do not expect to separately present LATAM financial results for future periods.  

(b) Included in operating income for the Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was an asset impairment charge of $1.6 million related to a planned sale of certain foreign operations and assets.  

(c) Equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates includes unconsolidated affiliates that are operationally integral to the operations of Quanta and primarily consists of earnings related to LUMA, which commenced operations in June 2020.  

(d) Included in operating income for the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were severance and restructuring charges of $4.1 million related to the exit of certain ancillary pipeline operations and an asset impairment charge of $1.3 million related to the planned sale of a barge. Included in operating income for the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were asset impairment charges of $10.2 million primarily related to the winding down and exit of certain oil-influenced operations and assets.  

(e) Included in corporate and non-allocated costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 is $14.0 million of non-cash stock-based compensation related to the correction of prior period amounts related to the valuation of and accounting for certain performance-based equity awards that were awarded in the years 2017 to 2019. Included in the correction was $2.0 million and $7.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation related to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Also included for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were acquisition and integration costs of $6.9 million and $19.8 million and increases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $0.1 million and $0.7 million. Included in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were acquisition and integration costs of $4.3 million and $24.8 million and increases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $5.3 million and $13.4 million. Also included in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was an asset impairment charge of $2.1 million related to an internally-developed software application that has been replaced.

Remaining Performance Obligations and Backlog (a non-GAAP measure)  

Quanta’s remaining performance obligations represent management’s estimate of consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the remaining portion of firm orders for fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work has not yet begun. For purposes of calculating remaining performance obligations, Quanta includes all estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities, revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to occur and revenues from change orders to the extent management believes additional contract revenues will be earned and are deemed probable of collection.  

While backlog is not a defined term under GAAP, it is a common measurement used in Quanta’s industry. Quanta believes this non-GAAP measure enables it to more effectively forecast its future results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Quanta believes this measure is also useful for investors in forecasting its future results and comparing Quanta to its competitors. Quanta’s remaining performance obligations, as described above, are a component of Quanta’s backlog calculation, which also includes estimated orders under master service agreements (MSAs), including estimated renewals, and non-fixed price contracts expected to be completed within one year.

The following table presents the non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which, when used in connection with diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net income attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. As to certain of the items below, (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s acquisition activity; (iv) asset impairment charges can vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors; (v) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses; (vi) impairments of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates vary from period to period depending on various market factors outside Quanta’s influence or control; (vii) severance and restructuring charges vary from period to period depending on the timing and nature of restructuring activities; (viii) write-offs of deferred financing costs vary from period to period depending on the timing and nature of debt and other financing transactions; (ix) gains or losses on sales of investments vary from period to period depending on whether investments are sold and the variability of market and other factors impacting the value of such investments; (x) bargain purchase gains vary from period to period depending on Quanta’s acquisition activity and the valuation of acquired businesses; (xi) deferred income tax valuation allowance changes vary period to period and depend on Quanta’s assessment of realizability of its deferred tax assets; (xii) income tax contingency releases vary period to period and depend on the level of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the expiration dates under various federal and state statute of limitations periods; (xiii) changes in statutory tax rates are not regularly occurring items; and (xiv) tax settlements and adjustments to related indemnification assets vary from period to period depending on the status and resolution of pending matters. Because adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, as defined, excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock as presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.

The following table presents the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which when used in connection with net income attributable to common stock, are intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity in (earnings) losses of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates, and adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain other items as described below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stock or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net income attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent when including the excluded items. As to certain of the items below, (i) equity in (earnings) losses of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates varies from period to period depending on the activity and financial performance of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates, including deferral and subsequent recognition upon completion of construction of earnings on contracts performed for entities in which Quanta has an equity interest and gain or loss on sales of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary from period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s acquisition activity; (iv) asset impairment charges vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors; (v) severance and restructuring charges vary from period to period depending on restructuring activities; (vi) bargain purchase gains vary from period to period depending on Quanta’s acquisition activity and the valuation of acquired businesses; (vii) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses; and (viii) tax settlements and adjustments to related indemnification assets vary from period to period depending on the status and resolution of pending matters. Because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow:  

The non-GAAP measure of free cash flow, when used in connection with net cash provided by operating activities, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s ability to generate the cash required to maintain and potentially expand its business. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures is defined as capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and from insurance settlements related to property and equipment.  

Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to Quanta’s investors because free cash flow is viewed by management as an important indicator of how much cash is provided or used by routine business operations, including the impact of net capital expenditures. Management uses this measure for capital allocation purposes as it is viewed as a measure of cash available to fund debt payments, acquire businesses, repurchase common stock, declare and pay dividends; and transact other investing and financing activities. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net cash provided by operating activities, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.
