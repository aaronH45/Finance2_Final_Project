At the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding option to purchase a Common Share, regardless of whether vested or unvested, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, plus the amount of the Special Pre-Closing Dividend, minus the exercise price per Common Share underlying such option and (ii) each restricted stock unit with respect to a Common Share which was outstanding as of the date the Merger Agreement, regardless of whether vested or unvested, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, plus the amount of the Special Pre-Closing Dividend.
