 Item 7.01.  

Regulation FD Disclosure.  

Mondelēz International, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “our” or “Mondelēz International”) are furnishing this current report to provide supplemental non-GAAP financial information related to the retrospective impact of our sales of approximately 14.1 million Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (“KDP”) ordinary shares on August 3, 2020 and approximately 12.5 million KDP ordinary shares on September 9, 2020. As a result of these sales, our equity interest in KDP decreased by 1.9% from 13.1% to 11.2%.  

Due to our reporting of KDP’s results on a one-quarter lag basis, the impact of the sale of these shares will affect our non-GAAP financial results beginning with the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. Consistent with our definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures, we will reflect this partial sale of our equity method investment in KDP as a divestiture, resulting in the recasting of our non-GAAP financial results for the first nine months of 2020, all quarters of 2020, 2019 and 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.  

Change to our Historical Non-GAAP Financial Results in Connection with our Sales of KDP shares  

As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we sold approximately 14.1 million shares of KDP on August 3, 2020, which reduced our ownership interest by 1.0% to 12.1% of the total outstanding shares. We received $414 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $181 million (or $139 million after tax) during the third quarter of 2020. Subsequently, on September 9, 2020, we sold approximately 12.5 million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership interest by 0.9% to 11.2% of the total outstanding shares. We received $363 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $154 million (or $119 million after tax) during the third quarter of 2020.  

We consider the 1.9% ownership reduction resulting from these sales of shares a partial sale of our equity method investment in KDP. Consistent with our definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures, we consider these sales to be a divestiture. Due to our reporting of KDP’s results on a one-quarter lag basis, the impact of the sale of these shares will affect our non-GAAP financial results beginning with the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. Therefore, we will remove the equity method investment net earnings results related to this partial sale of our equity method investment in KDP from our non-GAAP financial results for Adjusted EPS for all historical periods presented. Our U.S. GAAP results, which include our historical equity method investment net earnings from KDP, will not change from what was previously reported.  

Recast Amounts Reflecting Changes in Historical Non-GAAP Results  

The change to our non-GAAP financial results for Adjusted EPS described above does not affect our previously reported consolidated financial results nor does it affect our non-GAAP financial results for Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit or Adjusted Operating Income for any period. This supplemental disclosure does not amend any disclosure contained in any of our prior SEC filings. See the chart below and Exhibit 99.1 for the unaudited GAAP and recast non-GAAP financial information for the first nine months of 2020, all quarters of 2020, 2019 and 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Financial Schedules  

Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K contains financial schedules that provide the reconciliations for our recast non-GAAP financial results for Adjusted EPS due to the partial sale of our equity method investment in KDP for the first nine months of 2020, all quarters of 2020, 2019 and 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.  

   •    

Schedule 1 provides reconciliations of the differences between the recast Adjusted (non-GAAP) financial measures and their most directly comparable reported (GAAP) financial measures. Equity method investment net earnings and Provision for income taxes are components used to calculate net earnings and diluted earnings per share attributable to Mondelēz International.  

   •    

Schedule 2 provides reconciliations between the reported diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International (GAAP) and the recast Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP).  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results and identify trends in our underlying operating results, and it provides additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. For additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, see Exhibit 99.2.
