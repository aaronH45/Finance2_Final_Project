Item 7.01.Regulation FD Disclosure.

On February 27, 2021, TransDigm Group Incorporated ("TransDigm Group" or the "Company") entered into a definitive agreement to sell its ScioTeq and TREALITY Simulation Visual Systems businesses (collectively, "the businesses") to OpenGate Capital in a transaction valued at approximately $200 million.

ScioTeq and TREALITY were acquired by TransDigm Group in March 2019 as part of the Esterline Technologies acquisition. The businesses develop and manufacture advanced visualization solutions primarily for the global defense, air traffic control, and security end markets. The businesses have approximately 450 employees and operate primarily from Belgium, with secondary locations in the United States. The businesses generated revenues of approximately $135 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.

The divestiture, which is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2021.

The Company issued a press release announcing its entry into the definitive agreement. A copy of the press release is hereby furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 as Exhibit 99.1.
