“Our fourth quarter results benefited from continued strength in our Residential focused businesses and we built momentum carrying over into the new year. For 2020, we were very pleased to deliver sales and earnings growth while generating over $500 million in free cash flow and returning over half of that to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We ended the year with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and we remain committed to building on our strong foundation both organically and inorganically.”
