39th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference José (Joe) E. Almeida, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer January 11, 2021  

2 Safe Harbor Statement This presentation includes forward-looking statements concerning Baxter’s preliminary financial results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2020, business development activities, capital structure, cost savings initiatives, and R&D pipeline, including results of clinical trials and planned product launches. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: demand for and market acceptance of risks for new and existing products (including the impact of reduced hospital admission rates and elective surgery volumes); product development risks (including any delays in required regulatory approvals); product quality or patient safety concerns; continuity, availability and pricing of acceptable raw materials and component supply; inability to create additional production capacity in a timely manner or the occurrence of other manufacturing or supply difficulties (including as a result of a natural disaster, public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, regulatory actions or otherwise); the impact of global economic conditions (including potential trade wars) and continuing public health crises and epidemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), including related resurgences, on us and our customers and suppliers, including foreign governments in countries in which we operate; breaches or failures of the company’s information technology systems or products, including by cyberattack, unauthorized access or theft (as a result of increased remote working arrangements or otherwise); the adequacy of the company’s cash flows from operations (which may be negatively impacted by collectability concerns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise) and other sources of liquidity to meet its ongoing cash obligations and fund its investment program; loss of key employees or inability to identify and recruit new employees; future actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities, including the FDA, the Department of Justice, the SEC, the New York Attorney General and foreign regulatory agencies, including the continued delay in lifting the warning letter at our Ahmedabad facility or proceedings related to the investigation related to foreign exchange gains and losses; the outcome of pending or future litigation, including the opioid litigation and litigation related to our internal investigation of foreign exchange gains and losses; the impacts of the material weakness identified as a result of the internal investigation and our remediation efforts, including the risk that we may experience additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies; proposed regulatory changes of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in kidney health policy and reimbursement, which may substantially change the U.S. end stage renal disease market and demand for our peritoneal dialysis products, necessitating significant multi-year capital expenditures, which are difficult to estimate in advance; failures with respect to compliance programs; accurate identification of and execution on business development and R&D opportunities and realization of anticipated benefits (including the acquisitions of Cheetah Medical and Seprafilm Adhesion Barrier); future actions of third parties, including payers; U.S. healthcare reform and other global austerity measures; pricing, reimbursement, taxation and rebate policies of government agencies and private payers; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates; the ability to enforce owned or in-licensed patents or the prevention or restriction of the manufacture, sale or use of products or technology affected by patents of third parties; global, trade and tax policies; any change in laws concerning the taxation of income (including current or future tax reform), including income earned outside the United States and potential taxes associated with the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax; actions taken by tax authorities in connection with ongoing tax audits; and other risks identified in Baxter’s most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on Baxter’s website. Baxter does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements unless otherwise required by the federal securities laws.  

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 3 To supplement Baxter’s consolidated financial statements presented on a U.S. GAAP basis, the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. An explanation of the ways in which Baxter management uses these supplemental non-GAAP measures to evaluate its business and the substantive reasons why Baxter management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors is included in the Company’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021. This information should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Baxter strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the Company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Non-GAAP financial measures used in this presentation include constant currency and operational sales growth.
