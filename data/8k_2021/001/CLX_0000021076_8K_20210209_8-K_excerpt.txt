Item 8.01 Other Events. 

Effective February 9, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) of The Clorox Company (the “Company”) adopted a clawback policy (the “Clawback Policy”) related to incentive compensation granted, promised or paid to certain current and former executive officers (and others as the Committee may determine) on or after the Effective Date. Under the terms of the Clawback Policy: 

 ● In the event a covered individual engages in conduct materially detrimental to the Company (including, but not limited to, the name, business interests or corporate, brand, business or other reputation of the Company), the Committee may, in its sole discretion, clawback incentive compensation paid to such individual at any time up to three years after the end of the year in which it vested or was paid; and 

 ● In the event of a restatement of the Company’s financial statements, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, recoup incentive compensation paid to a covered individual during the three-year period preceding the announcement of the restatement that would not have been paid based upon the restated results if the covered individual’s fraud or intentional misconduct was a significant contributing factor to the restatement.  

Certain of the Company’s existing compensation plans and agreements contain a provision providing for the clawback of the incentive compensation following a restatement of the Company’s financial statements. The Clawback Policy incorporates such existing clawback provisions without any material changes in order to include all clawback provisions for covered individuals in the Clawback Policy.
