Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (“DEC”) and Duke Energy Progress, LLC (“DEP” and, together with DEC, the “Companies”) entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement”) with the Public Staff-North Carolina Utilities Commission (“Public Staff”), the North Carolina Attorney General’s Office (“AGO”) and the Sierra Club (collectively, the “Intervenor Settling Parties” and, together with DEC and DEP, the “Parties”), which will be filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission ("NCUC") on January 25, 2021. The Settlement resolves all coal ash prudence and cost recovery issues in connection with the Companies’ 2019 rate cases filed with the NCUC, as well as the equitable sharing issue on remand from the Companies’ 2017 North Carolina rate cases as a result of the December 11, 2020, North Carolina Supreme Court opinion. The Settlement also provides clarity on coal ash cost recovery through January 2030, for DEC and through February 2030, for DEP (the “Term”).

In addition to resolving all coal ash prudence and cost recovery issues in the 2019 DEC and DEP North Carolina rate cases and resolving the issue on remand in the 2017 DEC and DEP North Carolina rate cases, pursuant to the Settlement, the Companies agreed to not seek recovery of approximately $1 billion of system-wide deferred coal ash expenditures. The Companies will retain the ability to earn a debt and equity return during the amortization period, which shall be five years in the pending 2019 North Carolina rate cases and will be set by the NCUC in future rate case proceedings. The equity return and the amortization period on deferred coal ash costs under the 2017 DEC and DEP North Carolina rate cases will remain unaffected. The equity return on deferred coal ash costs under the 2019 North Carolina rate cases and future rate cases in North Carolina during the Term will be set at 150 basis points lower than the authorized return on equity then in effect, with a capital structure composed of 48% debt and 52% equity. The Companies retain the ability to earn a full weighted average cost of capital return during the deferral period – the period from when costs are incurred until they are recovered in rates.

The Intervenor Settling Parties agree that the Companies’ execution of the Settlement Agreement between the Companies and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality ("DEQ") dated December 31, 2019 (the “DEQ Settlement”) and the coal ash management plans included therein or subsequently approved by DEQ are reasonable and prudent. The Intervenor Settling Parties retain the right to challenge the reasonableness and prudence of the Companies’ actions taken and costs incurred to implement the scope of work agreed upon in the DEQ Settlement after February 1, 2020, for DEC and March 1, 2020 for DEP. The Intervenor Settling Parties further agreed to waive rights to challenge the reasonableness or prudence of the Companies’ historical coal ash management practices, and to waive the right to assert any arguments that future coal ash costs, including financing costs, shall be shared between either Company and customers through equitable sharing or any other rate base or return adjustment that shares the revenue requirement burden of coal ash costs not otherwise disallowed due to imprudence through the Term. 

The Parties agree to share future coal ash insurance litigation proceeds between the Companies and North Carolina customers, if achieved. 

As a result of the Settlement, DEC and DEP will each take a one-time estimated pre-tax charge to earnings of approximately $500 million, in the fourth quarter of 2020, which will be treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted earnings per share. 

The Settlement is subject to the review and approval of the NCUC. The Parties intend to request an expedited review by the NCUC and anticipate an order on the pending 2019 DEC rate case in the coming weeks and on the 2019 DEP North Carolina rate case shortly thereafter.

Item 2.06. Material Impairments.

The information contained in Item 1.01 above relating to material charges is incorporated into this Item 2.06 by reference.

•The influence of weather and other natural phenomena on operations, including the economic, operational and other effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and tornadoes, including extreme weather associated with climate change;

•The inherent risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities, including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks, including the financial stability of third-party service providers; 

•The timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and interest rates and the ability to recover such costs through the regulatory process, where appropriate, and their impact on liquidity positions and the value of underlying assets; 

•The results of financing efforts, including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected by various factors, including credit ratings, interest rate fluctuations, compliance with debt covenants and conditions and general market and economic conditions; 

•Credit ratings of Duke Energy Corporation, DEC and DEP (the Duke Energy Registrants) may be different from what is expected; 

•Declines in the market prices of equity and fixed-income securities and resultant cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; 

•Construction and development risks associated with the completion of the Duke Energy Registrants’ capital investment projects, including risks related to financing, obtaining and complying with terms of permits, meeting construction budgets and schedules and satisfying operating and environmental performance standards, as well as the ability to recover costs from customers in a timely manner, or at all; 

•Changes in rules for regional transmission organizations, including changes in rate designs and new and evolving capacity markets, and risks related to obligations created by the default of other participants; 

•The ability to control operation and maintenance costs; 

•The level of creditworthiness of counterparties to transactions; 

•The ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs; 

•Employee workforce factors, including the potential inability to attract and retain key personnel;

•The ability to implement our business strategy, including enhancing existing technology systems.

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than described. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Duke Energy Registrants expressly disclaim an obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
