[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

DEERFIELD, Ill. – Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) today announced fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2020. 

Sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $11.2 billion, a 15% decrease compared with $13.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating profit margin was 12.3% for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with 14.1% for the fourth quarter of 2019. Fourth-quarter 2020 profit per share was $1.42, compared with $1.97 profit per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $2.12, compared with fourth-quarter 2019 adjusted profit per share of $2.71. Fourth-quarter 2020 adjusted profit per share of $2.12 reflects strong operational performance and a lower effective tax rate.

Full-year sales and revenues in 2020 were $41.7 billion, down 22% compared with $53.8 billion in 2019. The sales decline reflected lower end-user demand and dealers reducing their inventories by $2.9 billion in 2020. Operating profit margin was 10.9% for 2020, compared with 15.4% for 2019. Full-year profit was $5.46 per share in 2020, compared with profit of $10.74 per share in 2019. Adjusted profit per share in 2020 was $6.56, compared with adjusted profit per share of $11.40 in 2019. 

“I’m proud of our global team’s continued resilience in safely navigating COVID-19 while continuing to provide the essential products and services the world needs,” said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby. “Our fourth-quarter and full-year results reflect the team’s agility in a challenging environment while executing our strategy for long-term profitable growth. We achieved the adjusted operating profit margin established during our 2019 Investor Day while continuing to invest in products and services. We are well-positioned for the future and will emerge from the pandemic as an even stronger company.”

In 2020, adjusted profit per share excluded mark-to-market losses for remeasurement of pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans and restructuring costs. In 2019, adjusted profit per share excluded mark-to-market losses for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans, restructuring costs and a discrete tax benefit related to U.S. tax reform. Please see in the appendix on page 14 a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.

For the full year of 2020, enterprise operating cash flow was $6.3 billion. During the year, the company paid dividends of $2.2 billion and repurchased $1.1 billion of Caterpillar common stock. Liquidity remains strong with an enterprise cash balance of $9.4 billion at the end of 2020.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Consolidated Sales and Revenues

The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between the fourth quarter of 2019 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2020 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees.

Total sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $11.235 billion, a decrease of $1.909 billion, or 15%, compared with $13.144 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decline was mostly due to lower sales volume driven by lower end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2019.

Sales were lower across the three primary segments, with the largest decline in Energy & Transportation.

Consolidated Operating Profit

The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between the fourth quarter of 2019 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2020 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. The bar titled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation’s other operating (income) expenses.

Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.380 billion, a decrease of $470 million, or 25%, compared with $1.850 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses. In addition, operating profit declined due to lower profit from Financial Products.

Manufacturing costs were lower due to favorable impact from cost absorption, lower material and period manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory decreased more in the fourth quarter of 2019 than in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

SG&A/R&D expenses and period manufacturing costs benefited from reduced short-term incentive compensation expense and other cost reductions related to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher labor and benefits costs.

Other Profit/Loss and Tax Items 

•Other income (expense) in the fourth quarter of 2020 was an expense of $309 million, compared with an expense of $373 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The change was primarily driven by lower pension and OPEB costs including lower mark-to-market losses for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans and impacts from gains (losses) on marketable securities at Insurance Services, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange gains (losses). The favorable impact of gains (losses) on marketable securities reflected unrealized gains in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with unrealized losses in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the absence of realized gains that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019.

•The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2020 reflected an annual effective tax rate of approximately 28%, compared with 25% for the fourth quarter of 2019, excluding the discrete items discussed below. The increase from 2019 was primarily related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the company recorded a $96 million tax benefit due to the change from the third quarter estimated annual tax rate of 31%, compared to a $64 million tax benefit for the reduction in the annual effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, the company recorded a tax benefit of $92 million related to $438 million of pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a $105 million tax benefit related to $468 million of mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter of 2019. Finally, the company recorded a tax benefit of $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Construction Industries’ total sales were $4.508 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $512 million, or 10%, compared with $5.020 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was due to lower sales volume, driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories and slightly lower end-user demand. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2019.

▪In North America, sales decreased mostly due to lower sales volume driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories and lower end-user demand. The lower end-user demand was primarily the result of weaker pipeline and road construction. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2019.

▪Sales declined in Latin America primarily due to the unfavorable currency impacts from a weaker Brazilian real and lower sales volume. 

▪In EAME, sales were about flat as lower sales volume across several countries in the region was offset by favorable price realization and favorable currency impacts from a stronger euro. Lower sales volume was driven by lower end-user demand, partially offset by the impact of changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2019 than during the fourth quarter of 2020.

▪Sales decreased in Asia/Pacific primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization, partially offset by favorable currency impacts from both a stronger Chinese yuan and Australian dollar. The decrease in sales was mainly driven by China, where higher end-user demand was more than offset by unfavorable impacts from changes in dealer inventories. This was partially offset by higher demand in several other countries.

Construction Industries’ profit was $630 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $29 million, or 4%, compared with $659 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales volume and higher warranty expense, partially offset by favorable impact of cost absorption and lower SG&A/R&D expenses. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with a decrease

during the fourth quarter of 2019. SG&A/R&D expenses benefited from reduced short-term incentive compensation expense and other cost reductions related to lower sales volumes.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Resource Industries’ total sales were $2.180 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $215 million, or 9%, compared with $2.395 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was due to lower end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts. End-user demand was lower for heavy construction and quarry and aggregates and was also lower in mining, but to a lesser extent.

Resource Industries’ profit was $273 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $12 million, or 5%, compared with $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase was mainly due to favorable manufacturing costs and lower SG&A/R&D expenses which was mostly offset by lower sales volume. Favorable manufacturing costs reflected favorable variable labor and burden, impact of cost absorption, period manufacturing costs and material costs. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory decreased in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with being about flat in the fourth quarter of 2020. SG&A/R&D expenses, along with period manufacturing costs, benefited from lower short-term incentive compensation expense, other cost-reduction actions implemented and benefits from prior restructuring programs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Energy & Transportation’s total sales were $4.811 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $1.138 billion, or 19%, compared with $5.949 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Sales declined across all applications.

▪Oil and Gas – Sales decreased mainly due to lower demand in North America for reciprocating engines used in gas compression and well servicing. In addition, sales were lower for turbines and turbine-related services.

▪Power Generation – Sales decreased primarily due to lower sales volume in small reciprocating engines, turbines and turbine-related services and engine aftermarket parts. 

▪Industrial – Sales decreased due to lower demand across all regions.

▪Transportation – Sales declined in rail due to lower rail services and locomotives deliveries, primarily in North America. Marine sales were also lower.

Energy & Transportation’s profit was $687 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $478 million, or 41%, compared with $1.165 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was due to lower sales volume, partially offset by lower SG&A/R&D expenses and period manufacturing costs. SG&A/R&D expenses and period manufacturing costs were mostly impacted by a reduction in short-term incentive compensation expense and other cost-reduction actions implemented in response to lower sales volumes.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Financial Products’ segment revenues were $743 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $103 million, or 12%, from the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily because of lower average financing rates across all regions and lower average earning assets in North America.

Financial Products’ segment profit was $195 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $210 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to higher provision for credit losses, an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment and lower average earning assets at Cat Financial. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a reduction in SG&A expenses primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation and a favorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services.

At the end of 2020, past dues at Cat Financial were 3.49%, compared with 3.14% at the end of 2019. Past dues increased primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by decreases in the Caterpillar Power Finance, EAME and Latin American portfolios. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $222 million for 2020, compared with $237 million for 2019. As of December 31, 2020, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $479 million, or 1.77% of finance receivables, compared with $424 million, or 1.50% of finance receivables at December 31, 2019.

Corporate Items and Eliminations

Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2019.

APPENDIX

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.

Adjusted Profit

The company believes it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of three significant items in order for the company’s results to be meaningful to readers. These items consist of (i) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (ii) restructuring costs, which were incurred to generate longer-term benefits, and (iii) U.S. tax reform impact in 2019. The company does not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believes the non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing the company’s period-over-period results.

Reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are as follows:
