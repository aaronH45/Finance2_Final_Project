TV ENTERTAINMENT  

• In Q4, CBS was the most-watched network in Daytime and Late Night and claimed the quarter’s top drama, news magazine and 4 of the top 5 comedies, as well as the top new comedy series.  

• Q4 2020 revenue benefitted from strong affiliate revenue growth, which âŽ¯ was offset by lower content licensing revenue.  

Affiliate revenue increased 23% year-over-year, driven by growth in reverse compensation and retransmission fees, as well as âŽ¯ robust streaming subscription revenue from CBS All Access.  

Advertising revenue declined 1% year-over-year, reflecting the impacts from the delayed start of the fall broadcast season and the sale of CNET Media Group, which was offset by record âŽ¯ growth in political advertising.  

Content licensing revenue decreased 20% year-over-year due to a lower volume of licensing from COVID-related production delays.  

• Adjusted OIBDA decreased 12% year-over-year mainly because of increased expenses to support the growth and expansion of CBS All Access.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(Unaudited; in millions, except per share amounts)  

Results for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included certain items identified as affecting  

comparability. Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted OIBDA”), adjusted  

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings  

from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations  

(together, the “adjusted measures”) exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not  

calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  

We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the  

primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important  

indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among  

other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because  

they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a  

clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare  

our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.  

Because the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should  

not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), earnings (loss) from continuing  

operations before income taxes, provision benefit for income taxes, net earnings (loss) from continuing operations  

attributable to ViacomCBS or diluted EPS from continuing operations, as applicable, as indicators of operating  

performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed  

by other companies.  

The following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in  

accordance with GAAP.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Continued) (Unaudited; in millions, except per share amounts) Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects our net cash flow provided by operating activities (used for) from continuing operation less capital expenditures. Our calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to our operations. Our net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to us to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain our capital assets, satisfy our tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of our operating performance. We believe the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is among several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by our investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of our operating performance to other companies in our industry. As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities from continuing operations as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. The following table presents a reconciliation of our net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities from continuing operations to free cash flow: Quarter Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities from continuing operations (GAAP) (339) (530) 2,215 1,171 Capital expenditures (114) (99) (324) (345) Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) $ (453) $ (629) $ 1,891 $ 826
