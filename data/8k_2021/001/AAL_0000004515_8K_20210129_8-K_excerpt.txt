ITEM 1.01. 

ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. 

At the Market Offering 

On October 22, 2020, AAG entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “Prior Distribution Agreement”), relating to the issuance and sale from time to time by AAG (the “Prior ATM”), through the investment banks identified therein, of shares of AAG’s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,000,000,000. Since the Prior ATM’s inception on October 22, 2020 through January 28, 2021, we sold an aggregate of 68,561,487 shares of our common stock at an average price of $12.87 per share, raising gross proceeds of approximately $882.4 million. On January 28, 2021, we provided notice of the termination of the Prior ATM, effective as of January 28, 2021. 

On January 29, 2021, AAG entered into a new equity distribution agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Barclays Capital Inc. and BNP Paribas Securities Corp. (collectively, the “Managers”), relating to the issuance and sale from time to time by AAG (the “ATM Offering”), through the Managers, of shares of AAG’s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,117,590,000 (the “ATM Shares”). Sales of the ATM Shares, if any, under the Distribution Agreement may be made in ordinary brokers’ transactions, to or through a market maker, on or through The Nasdaq Global Select Market, the existing trading market for AAG’s common stock, or any other market venue where AAG’s common stock may be traded, in the 

over-the-counter market, in privately negotiated transactions, or through a combination of any such methods of sale. The Managers may also sell AAG’s common stock by any other method permitted by law. 

Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, AAG may also sell ATM Shares to any Manager, as principal for its own account, including a block trade, at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. If AAG sells ATM Shares to a Manager as principal, AAG will enter into a separate terms agreement with such Manager and will describe any such agreement in a separate prospectus supplement or pricing supplement. 

The Distribution Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by AAG and customary obligations of the parties and termination provisions. AAG has agreed to indemnify the Managers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or to contribute to payments the Managers may be required to make with respect to any of those liabilities. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, AAG will pay the Managers a commission of 1.0% of the gross sales price of any ATM Shares sold. 

The ATM Shares to be sold under the Distribution Agreement, if any, will be issued and sold pursuant to the prospectus forming a part of AAG’s shelf registration statement on Form 

S-3 (File 

No. 333-236503), which became effective upon filing by AAG with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 19, 2020, and a prospectus supplement dated January 29, 2021 related thereto. AAG plans to use the net proceeds from any sales of ATM Shares pursuant to the Distribution Agreement for general corporate purposes and to enhance its liquidity position. 

The offering of common stock pursuant to the Distribution Agreement will terminate upon the earliest of (1) the sale of all ATM Shares subject to the Distribution Agreement, (2) the termination of the Distribution Agreement by AAG or by any of the Managers, with respect to such Manager only or (3) February 19, 2023. 

The foregoing description of the Distribution Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Distribution Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on 

Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference. 

The Managers and their related entities have engaged, and may in the future engage, in commercial and investment banking transactions with AAG in the ordinary course of their business. They have received, and expect to receive, customary compensation and expense reimbursement for these commercial and investment banking transactions. 

ITEM 1.02. 

TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. 

On January 28, 2021, the Company provided notice of the termination of the Prior Distribution Agreement, effective as of January 28, 2021 and the Prior Distribution Agreement was terminated pursuant to its terms. At the time the Prior Distribution Agreement was terminated, we had sold an aggregate of 68,561,487 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $882.4 million, with shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to approximately $117.6 remaining unsold. The material terms and conditions of the Prior Distribution Agreement and the Prior ATM were described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 

8-K filed on October 22, 2020. 

ITEM 8.01. 

OTHER EVENTS. 

Future Aircraft Deliveries and Financing Status 

Set forth below is an updated summary of the mainline aircraft that we have under contract for scheduled delivery after the date of this report with respect to the balance of 2021 or in 2022: 

Boeing 737 MAX Family Aircraft. We have accepted delivery of five MAX aircraft year to date and presently expect an additional six MAX aircraft to be delivered in the balance of 2021 and ten MAX aircraft in 2022. We have financing commitments in place for three of the six MAX aircraft to be delivered in the balance of 2021 and do not have any financing commitments in place for the ten MAX aircraft to be delivered in 2022. However, we have the right to defer all of the 13 MAX aircraft deliveries that do not have committed financing to 2023 or 2024. 

Boeing 787 Family Aircraft. We have not accepted any 787 aircraft year to date and presently expect 19 787 aircraft to be delivered in the balance of 2021 and none in 2022. We have financing commitments in place for all 19 of these 787 aircraft. 

Airbus A321NEO Family Aircraft. We have accepted delivery of one NEO aircraft year to date and presently expect an additional 15 NEO aircraft to be delivered in the balance of 2021 and 26 NEO aircraft in 2022. We have financing commitments in place for all 15 NEO aircraft to be delivered in the balance of 2021. We do not have in place financing commitment (third party or backstop) for any of the 2022 NEO deliveries. 

Our ability to draw on the financing commitments described above is subject to (a) the satisfaction of various terms and conditions, including in some cases, on our acquisition of the aircraft by a certain date and (b) the performance by the counterparty providing such financing commitments of its obligations thereunder. 

Flight Cancellations on January 28, 2021 

On January 28, 2021, we experienced approximately 300 flight cancellations involving aircraft operated by our wholly-owned regional subsidiary, PSA Airlines, Inc. (“PSA”). The flight cancellations were due to a delay in conducting maintenance checks on PSA’s CRJ aircraft. Substantially all of the aircraft involved have been, or we expect promptly will be, returned to service, and we do not expect this event to have a material effect on our results of operations.
