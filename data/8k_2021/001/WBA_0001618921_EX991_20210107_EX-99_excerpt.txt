DEERFIELD, Ill., Jan. 7, 2021 - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (Nasdaq: WBA) today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which ended Nov. 30, 2020.  

Executive Vice Chairman and CEO Stefano Pessina said, “Our first quarter results exceeded expectations as we continue to deliver on our strategic priorities. As announced yesterday we have taken a major step forward in our transformation; we are divesting our pharmaceutical wholesale business with plans to use the proceeds to accelerate our investments in healthcare. While the business environment remains challenging, we are rising to the occasion with agility and discipline and we are confident in our outlook for adjusted EPS for the fiscal year. Our role in the healthcare system has never been more important, as the communities we serve continue to turn to our trusted brands and expert pharmacists. I am so proud of our teams and the historic and critical role they are playing to help the world emerge from the pandemic, administering COVID-19 vaccinations to frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable members of our society.”  

Overview of First Quarter Results  

WBA had fiscal 2021 first quarter sales of $36.3 billion, an increase of 5.7 percent from the year-ago quarter, and an increase of 5.2 percent on a constant currency basis1, reflecting growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and Pharmaceutical Wholesale.  

The company had an operating loss of $440 million in the first quarter, compared to operating income of $1.0 billion in the same quarter a year ago, entirely due to a $1.5 billion charge from the company’s equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, a decrease of 9.9 percent from the same quarter a year ago and a decrease of 10.1 percent on a constant currency basis.  

Net loss attributable to WBA2 was $308 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with net profit of $845 million in the same quarter a year ago. The loss was entirely due to the AmerisourceBergen charge. Loss per share was $0.36, compared to earnings per share (EPS) of $0.95 in the same quarter a year ago.   

Adjusted net earnings decreased 13.9 percent to $1.1 billion, down 14.3 percent on a constant currency basis, compared with the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.22, a decrease of 11.2 percent on a reported basis and a decrease of 11.6 percent on a constant currency basis, compared with the same quarter a year ago, reflecting an estimated adverse COVID-19 impact of $0.26 to $0.30 per share.  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in the first quarter and free cash flow was $763 million, an increase of 13 percent compared with the year-ago quarter.  

Company Outlook  

The company maintained fiscal 2021 guidance of low single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share at  

constant currency rates, with the profile skewed to opportunity:  

   •    

The first quarter exceeded expectations, reflecting strength in Boots UK and Boots Opticians.  

   •    

While the second quarter is expected to see higher adverse impacts from COVID-19 (including the weaker cough, cold and flu season), the company anticipates first-half fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be broadly in line with prior expectations.  

   •    

On a full-year basis, the opportunity from the distribution of vaccinations is likely to be offset by COVID-19 related lock-downs and restrictions, and by increased growth investments.  

Progress on Strategic Priorities  

Selected highlights of the company’s recent progress on strategic initiatives - creating neighborhood health destinations around a more modern pharmacy, accelerating digitalization, transforming and restructuring the company’s retail offering and transformational cost management - include the following:  

   •    

Walgreens pharmacists are playing a key, expanded role in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.  

   •    

Since COVID-19 testing began, Walgreens has administered more than 2.8 million tests.  

   •    

Working with federal and state governments, Walgreens is vaccinating residents and staff at more than 35,000 long-term care facilities in 49 states.  

   •    

Walgreens launched myWalgreens, a complete reinvention of its customer loyalty program.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   •    

Walgreens announced an acceleration of its investment in VillageMD and boosted the rollout of Village Medical at Walgreens full-service primary care clinics.  

   •    

Boots.com significantly expanded capacity and sales doubled from the year-ago quarter, outperforming the market.  

Business Divisions  

Retail Pharmacy USA:  

Retail Pharmacy USA had first quarter sales of $27.2 billion, an increase of 3.9 percent from the year-ago quarter, including the impact of previously announced store optimization programs. Sales in comparable stores increased 3.7 percent from the year-ago quarter reflecting a 5.0 percent increase in comparable pharmacy sales and a 0.4 percent growth in comparable retail sales. The estimated adverse COVID-19 impact on comparable sales included lower foot traffic in stores, weak retail cough, cold and flu sales, lower seasonal flu scripts and reduced new-to-therapy scripts.  

In comparable stores, prescriptions filled in the first quarter increased 2.7 percent from a year earlier, including an estimated negative impact of 210 basis points from COVID-19. Total prescriptions filled in the quarter increased 1.1 percent, compared with the same quarter a year earlier. The number of prescriptions filled was 297.3 million, including immunizations, adjusted to 30-day equivalents. Pharmacy sales, which accounted for 76.8 percent of the division’s sales in the quarter, increased 5.9 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.0 percent.  

2   

The division’s retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis in the first quarter decreased approximately 15 basis points over the year-ago quarter to 20.7 percent, as reported by IQVIA, an improvement over the decline in the fourth quarter and entirely driven by store optimization programs.  

Retail sales decreased 2.2 percent in the first quarter compared with the year-ago period, including the impact of the store optimization programs.  

Comparable retail sales grew 0.4 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago, held back by the significantly weaker cough, cold and flu season, which had an adverse impact of 150 basis points. Comparable retail sales, excluding tobacco and e-cigarettes, increased 1.9 percent. Within comparable retail store sales, a 13.1 percent decrease in beauty category sales and a 1.3 percent decrease in personal care category sales were partially offset by a 4.1 percent increase in health and wellness category sales. Excluding the impact of the weaker cough, cold and flu season, sales in the health and wellness category increased by 11.6 percent.  

Gross profit decreased 1.3 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago and adjusted gross profit decreased 1.8 percent, in both cases primarily due to pharmacy reimbursement pressure, partly offset by pharmacy procurement savings and a higher retail gross margin.  

First quarter SG&A decreased by 0.4 percent, primarily due to non-recurring costs related to the acquisition of Rite Aid stores in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted SG&A increased by 1.4 percent, as cost savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program partly offset higher growth investments and COVID-19 related costs of $83 million.  

Operating income in the first quarter decreased 6.6 percent to $792 million from the year-ago quarter, due to pharmacy reimbursement pressure and adverse impact from COVID-19, partly offset by savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program and non-recurring acquisition-related costs related to Rite Aid stores in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 14.4 percent, to $989 million, due to pharmacy reimbursement pressure and adverse impacts from COVID-19, partly offset by savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program.  

Retail Pharmacy International:  

Retail Pharmacy International had first quarter sales of $2.6 billion, a decrease of 6.2 percent from the year-ago quarter, including a favorable currency impact of 1.9 percent. Sales decreased 8.2 percent on a constant currency basis, mainly due to an 11.5 percent decrease in Boots UK sales resulting from COVID-19 related impacts.  

Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales increased 2.5 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting favorable timing of National Health System (NHS) reimbursement, which mitigated the impact of lower prescription volume and reduced demand for pharmacy services during the pandemic.  

Boots UK comparable retail sales decreased 9.1 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. COVID-19 continued to impact footfall, particularly in major high street, train station and airport stores. The ongoing recovery in footfall trends in September and October was set back by the re-introduction of stricter restrictions for the month of November. However, Boots.com continued to perform very strongly with sales up 106 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, partially offsetting the reduced footfall.  

Boots UK market share was lower in all categories except beauty, as the pandemic continued to impact heavily on buying habits and consumers temporarily shifted purchasing to one-stop grocery shopping.  

Gross profit decreased 9.0 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago, including a favorable currency impact of 2.3 percent. Adjusted gross profit decreased 11.5 percent, on a constant currency basis, reflecting lower UK retail sales and higher fulfillment costs, partly offset by the favorable timing of NHS reimbursement.  

SG&A in the quarter decreased 8.4 percent from the prior year quarter to $928 million, including an adverse currency impact of 2.0 percent. On a constant currency basis, adjusted SG&A decreased 12.5 percent. The decreases in SG&A and adjusted SG&A both reflect short-term cost mitigation actions and cost savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program.  

3   

Operating income decreased 22.7 percent to $34 million, reflecting increased investment in the Transformational Cost Management Program. Adjusted operating income was $84 million, an increase of 6.4 percent from the year-ago quarter. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 0.6 percent from the year-ago quarter, as decisive cost management actions and strong Boots.com performance fully mitigated the impact of COVID-19.  

Pharmaceutical Wholesale:  

Pharmaceutical Wholesale had first quarter sales of $7.1 billion, an increase of 18.6 percent from the year-ago quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 16.3 percent, including results of the company’s new joint venture in Germany, which were consolidated as of November.  

The division had an operating loss of $1.3 billion in the first quarter entirely due to a loss of $1.4 billion related to the company’s equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. This compared with operating income of $122 million in the year-ago quarter, which included $13 million from the company’s equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen.  

Adjusted operating income increased 6.7 percent to $244 million, up 7.4 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong sales growth and a higher contribution from AmerisourceBergen.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)  

REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(in millions, except per share amounts)  

The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the notes to the “Net Earnings and Diluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share” reconciliation table on page 13 for definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and related adjustments presented in this press release.  

These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the company’s business from period to period and trends in the company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis (including the information under “Company Outlook” above) where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.  

Constant currency  

The company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the United States reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and this presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  

Comparable sales  

For the company’s Retail Pharmacy divisions, comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least 12 consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster in the past 12 months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first 12 months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first 12 months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. Comparable retail sales for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, the company’s method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.  

10   

With respect to the Retail Pharmacy International division, comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales, are presented on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the discussion above in “Constant currency” for further details on constant currency calculations.  

Key Performance Indicators  

The company considers certain metrics, including all comparable metrics, number of prescriptions, number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions and number of locations at period end, to be key performance indicators because the company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.

NET EARNINGS (LOSS) AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

12   

 1   

Adjustments to equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen consist of the Company’s proportionate share of non-GAAP adjustments reported by AmerisourceBergen consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP measures. The Company recognized equity losses in AmerisourceBergen of $1,373 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020. These equity losses are primarily due to AmerisourceBergen recognition of $5.6 billion, net of tax, charges related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months period ended September 30, 2020.  

 2   

Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and inventory valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangibles assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements, the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of the inventory reflects cost of acquired inventory and a portion of the expected profit margin. The acquisition-related inventory valuation adjustments excludes the expected profit margin component from cost of sales recorded under the business combination accounting principles.  

 3   

Transformational Cost Management Program and Store Optimization Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 5   

Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger and acquisition related activities. These costs include all charges incurred on certain mergers and acquisition related activities, for example, including costs related to integration efforts for successful merger and acquisition activities. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger and acquisition related activities and do not reflect the Company’s current operating performance.  

 6   

Gain or loss on certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within other income (expense). We do not believe this volatility related to mark-to-market adjustment on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Company’s operational performance.  

 7   

Includes significant gain on sale of equity method investment and related adjustments.  

 8   

Adjustments to income tax provision include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax provision commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. tax law changes, a UK tax rate change and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded within income tax provision (benefit).  

 9   

Adjustments to post tax equity earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees’ non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded within post tax earnings (loss) from other equity method investments. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees.  

 10   

Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the quarterly calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2020.  

 11   

Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the quarterly calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes for the three months ended November 30, 2020.

Operating income (loss) for Pharmaceutical Wholesale includes equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen. As a result of the two month reporting lag, operating income (loss) for the three month period ended November 30, 2020 includes AmerisourceBergen equity earnings (loss) for the period of July 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. Operating income for the three month period ended November 30, 2019 includes AmerisourceBergen equity earnings for the period of July 1, 2019 through September 30, 2019, respectively.

FREE CASH FLOW  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1   

Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities in a period less additions to property, plant and equipment (capital expenditures) made in that period. This measure does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures as the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments for future business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statements of cash flows.
