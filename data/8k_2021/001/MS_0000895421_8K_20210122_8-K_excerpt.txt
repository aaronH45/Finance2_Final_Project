Item 8.01 Other Events  

Morgan Stanley (the “Firm”) today announced that the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Firm’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) has determined in consultation with the Firm’s Board of Directors the 2020 compensation for James P. Gorman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Firm. 

The Compensation Committee based its decision on its assessment of Mr. Gorman’s outstanding individual performance, including both significant progress in implementing a long-term strategy previously articulated by Mr. Gorman that has led to transformational change and a resilient business model, and the Firm’s record financial performance for 2020. 

2020 was a record year for Morgan Stanley in many respects, both in terms of financial performance and in terms of advancement of the Firm’s long-term strategic goals. Under Mr. Gorman’s leadership, for 2020: 

 ‒The Firm achieved record financial performance in terms of revenues and profit before tax. Firm net revenues were $48.2 billion with net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $11 billion. The Firm reported a full year ROTCE of 15.2% and earnings per share of $6.46. 

 ‒The Firm continued execution of its long-term strategy with the Wealth Management acquisition of E*TRADE and the pending Investment Management acquisition of Eaton Vance. The acquisition of E*TRADE positions the Firm as an industry leader in Wealth Management across all channels and segments and significantly increases the scale and breadth of the Firm’s Wealth Management franchise. The acquisition of Eaton Vance will establish Investment Management as a leading asset manager positioned for growth. 

 ‒The Firm continued a clear and consistent strategy to transform the business to emphasize more stable and durable balance sheet and sources of revenue, which should provide more predictable results during various market conditions in the future. The Firm’s strategy to transform the business was recognized by Moody’s, with an upgrading of the Firm’s rating to A2 senior (returning the Firm to its pre-financial crisis rating) and then placing the rating under review for possible upgrade. The market also recognized the Firm’s progress in 2020, as reflected in top performance in total shareholder return versus peers over 1, 3 & 5 year periods. During 2020, the Morgan Stanley share price increased by 34% from $51.12 to $68.53, adding $42.6 billion in market value. In addition, the recent stress test results confirmed the Firm’s solid capital position. 

 ‒The Firm focused on the health and wellbeing of its employees against an extremely challenging backdrop that included the COVID health crisis, extraordinary client financing demand, an increase in corporate defaults and bankruptcies, and record market volumes. Early in the crisis, the Firm committed to making no reductions in its workforce through 2020, providing reassurance to its employees in a very difficult time. The Firm also implemented changes in the best interest of its employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including having the vast majority of its employees work from home and providing productivity resources when necessary, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work, COVID-19 specific medical benefits, extended childcare benefits, mental health resources and modified work schedules. In addition, the Firm announced a commitment to provide financial assistance to 2,000 street vendors across New York City who were suffering from COVID-19 related business losses. 

 ‒The Firm strengthened its commitment to diversity and inclusion. As part of its continuing efforts in this area, the Firm added a commitment to diversity and inclusion as its fifth core value and announced the creation of the Institute for Inclusion, a Firm-wide effort chaired by Mr. Gorman with the mission to invest in underserved communities, advance equity through giving, and drive workplace diversity and inclusion. The Firm also supported a number of external organizations driving racial equity, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Carver Bank, and three top Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In addition, the Firm published its first Diversity and Inclusion Report in 2020, reflecting the Firm’s commitment to increase transparency and accountability for progress. 

The Compensation Committee set Mr. Gorman’s total compensation for 2020 at $33 million, an increase from $27 million for 2019. Mr. Gorman’s 2020 compensation is comprised of four parts: a base salary of $1.5 million; a cash bonus of $7.875 million; a deferred equity award of $7.875 million; and a performance-vested equity award of $15.75 million that converts to shares only if the Firm meets predetermined performance goals with respect to (a) average Firm return on tangible common equity and (b) relative total shareholder return over the three-year performance period. 

Consistent with previous years, 75% of Mr. Gorman’s incentive compensation is deferred over three years and is subject to clawback, and 100% of Mr. Gorman’s deferred incentive compensation is delivered in the form of equity awards, aligning his compensation with shareholders’ interests. 

Additional important information about the Registrant’s incentive compensation programs and governance, including an explanation of all material elements of the compensation for Mr. Gorman and the other named executive officers, will be presented in the Registrant’s proxy statement for the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2021.
