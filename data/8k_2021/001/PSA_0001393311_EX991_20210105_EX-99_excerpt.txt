Exhibit 99.1  

COOPERATION AGREEMENT  

This Cooperation Agreement (this “Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2021, is by and among Elliott Investment Management L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Elliott Associates, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and Elliott International, L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership (each, an “Elliott Party,” and together, the “Elliott Parties”), and Public Storage, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the “Company”). In consideration of and reliance upon the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Elliott Parties and the Company agree as follows:  

1. Board of Trustees; Formation of Committee.  

(a) Trustee Appointment. Within one (1) business day following the date hereof, the Board of Trustees of the Company (the “Board”) shall take (or shall have taken) such actions as are necessary to appoint each of Michelle Millstone-Shroff and Rebecca Owen (the “New Trustees”) as a member of the Board, in each case with an initial term expiring at the Company’s 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”) (any or both of which addition(s) the Elliott Parties acknowledge the Board may implement by filling trusteeship vacancies created by the Board expanding its size). The Company acknowledges that it considered the Elliott Parties’ input regarding the potential benefits of further Board enhancements and nominee skillsets in connection with the appointment of the three trustees to the Board that the Company announced on December 13, 2020 (the “December 2020 Trustees”). The Company agrees that it will include the New Trustees in the slate of Board-nominated and recommended trustee candidates standing for election at the 2021 Annual Meeting in accordance with and subject to the Company’s policies and procedures of general application to members of the Board and applicable law.  

(b) Trustee Departures. The Elliott Parties acknowledge that the Company has previously announced the departure of three incumbent trustees from the Board in connection with the appointment of the December 2020 Trustees. The Company acknowledges that one additional incumbent trustee will depart from the Board upon or prior to the appointment of the New Trustees (the “Trustee Retirement”) as described in the Press Release (as defined below).  

(c) New Trustee Agreements, Arrangements and Understandings. Each of the Elliott Parties agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates (as defined below) (i) will pay any compensation to the New Trustees (including any Replacement New Trustee (as defined below)) or other members of the Board in connection with such person’s service on the Board or any committee thereof or (ii) have or will have any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, written or oral, with the New Trustees (including any Replacement New Trustee) or other members of the Board regarding the Company, including regarding such person’s service on the Board or any committee thereof, except with respect to the agreements entered into prior to the date hereof with the New Trustees regarding their initial nomination by the Elliott Parties (accurate and complete copies of which have been previously disclosed to the Company).   

(d) Replacement New Trustee. If any New Trustee is unable or unwilling to serve as a trustee, resigns as a trustee, is removed as a trustee or ceases to be a trustee for any other reason prior to the expiration of the Cooperation Period (as defined below), the Elliott Parties and the Company will cooperate to select, and the Company will appoint, a substitute trustee mutually acceptable to the Company and the Elliott Parties (the “Replacement New Trustee”) to serve as a trustee of the Company for the remainder of such New Trustee’s term, which Replacement New Trustee must be a Qualified Candidate to be so selected. Effective upon the appointment of the Replacement New Trustee to the Board, such Replacement New Trustee will be considered a New Trustee for all purposes of this Agreement.  

(e) New Trustee Information. The Elliott Parties acknowledge that as a condition to each New Trustee’s (and any Replacement New Trustee’s) appointment to the Board and any subsequent nomination of each New Trustee and any Replacement New Trustee for election as a trustee at any future Company meeting of shareholders, each New Trustee (or Replacement New Trustee), if requested by the Company, shall provide any consents and information the Company reasonably requires in connection with such appointment or nomination, including completion of the Company’s standard forms and D&O questionnaires, information required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing under applicable law, stock exchange rules or listing standards, and information in connection with assessing eligibility, independence, and other criteria applicable to trustees or satisfying compliance and legal obligations, and to consent to appropriate background checks, in each case, to the extent consistent with the information and background checks required by the Company in accordance with past practice with respect to other members of the Board.  

(f) Company Policies. The parties hereto acknowledge that each New Trustee (and any Replacement New Trustee), upon appointment to the Board, will be governed by the same protections and obligations regarding confidentiality, conflicts of interest, related party transactions, fiduciary duties, codes of conduct, trading and disclosure policies, trustee resignation policy, employee interaction, and other governance guidelines and policies of the Company as other trustees of the Company (collectively, “Company Policies”), and shall have the same rights and benefits, including with respect to insurance, indemnification, compensation, fees, and reimbursement of expenses, as are applicable to all Independent trustees of the Company. The Company acknowledges that the Company Policies do not apply to the Elliott Parties and their Affiliates, including Company Policies with respect to trading in the Company’s securities, as they are not trustees or employees of the Company.  

(g) Long Term Planning Committee. The Board shall take all action necessary to form an advisory Long Term Planning Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) heading into the Investor Day (as defined below) to support the Board and management’s reviews of the matters set forth in the Committee’s charter. The Board shall cause the Committee to be composed of six (6) members, initially including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who shall serve as Chairman of the Committee, the New Trustees, two of the December 2020 Trustees, and one other trustee who is Independent as determined by the Board, as specifically identified in the Committee Charter (as defined below). If any New Trustee is unable or unwilling to serve as a member of the Committee, resigns as a member, is removed as a member or ceases to be a member for any other reason prior to the Investor Day, the Elliott Parties shall be entitled to select, in consultation with the Company and as approved by the Board (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), a trustee serving on the Board at the time of such selection (including a Replacement New Trustee) to serve on the Committee as a replacement for such member (the “Replacement Committee Member”), provided that such Company consultation and Board  

-2-   

 approval shall not be required for a Replacement New Trustee selected by the Elliott Parties to serve as a Replacement Committee Member. Effective upon the appointment of the Replacement Committee Member to the Committee, such Replacement Committee Member will be considered a “New Trustee” solely for the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence. The charter of the Committee shall be in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A (the “Committee Charter”), and shall not be modified prior to the Investor Day except with the written consent of the Elliott Parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company agrees that the Committee shall continue in existence until the completion of the Investor Day, or such later date as may be determined by the Chairman of the Committee following consultation with the Board.  

(h) Minimum Ownership Requirement. The rights of the Elliott Parties with respect to a Replacement New Trustee under Section 1(d) and a Replacement Committee Member under Section 1(g) shall expire at such time as the Elliott Parties cease to have a “net long position” of at least 0.75% of the Voting Securities (the “Minimum Ownership Threshold”). In the event that the Elliott Parties seek to exercise such rights, the Elliott Parties shall certify in writing to the Company that the Minimum Ownership Threshold is satisfied as of the proposed time of such exercise.  

(i) Board Size. The Company agrees that from the Trustee Retirement and the appointment of the New Trustees as members of the Board until the end of the Cooperation Period, the size of the Board shall be no greater than fourteen (14) trustees.  

(j) Investor Day. On or prior to May 14, 2021, the Company shall hold an investor day (the “Investor Day”) consistent with the Press Release.  

(k) Termination. The Company’s obligations under this Section 1 shall terminate upon any material breach of this Agreement (including Section 2) by any Elliott Party upon five (5) business days’ written notice by the Company to the Elliott Parties if such breach has not been cured within such notice period, provided that the Company is not in material breach of this Agreement at the time such notice is given or prior to the end of the notice period.  

2. Cooperation.

(including any successor thereof) issues a voting recommendation that differs from the voting recommendation of the Board with respect to any Company-sponsored proposal submitted to shareholders at a shareholder meeting (other than with respect to the election of trustees to the Board, the removal of trustees from the Board, the size of the Board and the filling of vacancies on the Board), the Elliott Parties shall be permitted to vote in accordance with any such recommendation.  

(c) Standstill. During the Cooperation Period, each Elliott Party will not, and will cause its controlling and controlled (and under common control) Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives acting on their behalf (collectively with the Elliott Parties, the “Restricted Persons”) to not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent, invitation, or authorization of or by the Company or the Board:

(ii) (A) call or seek to call (publicly or otherwise), alone or in concert with others, a meeting of the Company’s shareholders or action by written consent (or the setting of a record date therefor), (B) seek, alone or in concert with others, election or appointment to, or representation on, the Board or nominate or propose the nomination of, or recommend the nomination of, any candidate to the Board, except as expressly set forth in Section 1, (C) make or be the proponent of any shareholder proposal to the Company or the Board or any committee thereof, (D) seek, alone or in concert with others (including through any “withhold” or similar campaign), the removal of any member of the Board, (E) conduct a referendum of shareholders of the Company or (F) submit any notice regarding cumulation of votes with respect to a meeting of the Company’s shareholders or a consent solicitation; provided that nothing in this Agreement will prevent the Elliott Parties or their Affiliates from taking actions in furtherance of identifying any Replacement New Trustee or trustee candidate in connection with the Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders;  

(iii) make any request for stock list materials or other books and records of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any statutory or regulatory provisions providing for shareholder access to books and records of the Company or its Affiliates;

-5-
