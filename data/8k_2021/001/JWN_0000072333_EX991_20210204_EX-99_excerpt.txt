Unlocking the Full Potential of The Digital-First Platform: Closer To You

To deliver on the Company’s growth priorities, Nordstrom is unlocking the full potential of its digital-first platform, with a focus on gaining deeper insights, acquiring new customers, offering more choices, and delivering better service. This will allow the Company to deliver its "closer to you" brand promise to serve customers on their terms.

•Deeper Insights. Nordstrom is leveraging its technology platform to create a unified view of the customer as well as the Company’s product and inventory. These efforts enable Nordstrom to provide personalization at scale and enhance the overall customer experience.

•New Customers. Nordstrom is expanding the aperture of who it serves, as well as where and how it serves them, with a particular focus on increasing the breadth of customers at Nordstrom Rack.
