Item 5.02Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors of PPG Industries, Inc. (the “Company”) elected Michael T. Nally and Guillermo Novo as directors of the Company to serve in the class whose term expires at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board of Directors appointed Mr. Nally to the Audit Committee and the Technology and Environment Committee of the Board of Directors and Mr. Novo to the Audit Committee and the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

As independent directors of the Company, Messrs. Nally and Novo will be entitled to receive compensation consistent with that of the Company’s other independent directors who are not employees of the Company, as described in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 5, 2020 under the caption “Compensation of Directors,” which portion of such proxy statement is incorporated herein by reference.

Mr. Novo is Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Ashland Global Holdings Inc. In 2020, PPG purchased approximately $21,500,000 of products and services from Ashland Global Holdings. Such purchases and sales were made in the ordinary course of each company’s business and amount to less than two percent of each company’s consolidated gross revenues for 2020. 

Neither Mr. Nally nor Mr. Novo were selected as a director of the Company pursuant to any arrangement or understanding between either Messrs. Nally and Novo and any other person or entity.

A press release reporting the approval of the election of Messrs. Nally and Novo as directors of the Company is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by reference.
