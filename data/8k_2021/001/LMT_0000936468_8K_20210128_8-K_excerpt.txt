 On January 29, 2021, Lockheed Martin Corporation (“Lockheed Martin” or the “Corporation”) announced that Marillyn A.

On January 28, 2021, the Board elected President and Chief Executive Officer, James D. Taiclet, to serve as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, effective March 1, 2021.

Following the recommendation of the Management Development and Compensation Committee (“Compensation Committee”), on January 28, 2021, the Board approved the following compensation for Ms. Hewson for her service as Strategic Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer, effective March 1, 2021:
