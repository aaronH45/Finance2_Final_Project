Full Year Business Segment Results

Utility

For full year 2020, the Utility business reported earnings attributable to Entergy Corporation of $1,800 million, or $8.95 per share, on an as-reported basis, and earnings of $1,424 million, or $7.08 per share, on an adjusted basis. This compared to full year 2019 earnings of $1,411 million, or $7.16 per share, on an as-reported basis, and $1,369 million, or $6.95 per share, on an adjusted basis. Drivers for the full year included: 

•net effect of regulatory actions across the operating companies;

•lower other O&M; and

•a lower effective income tax rate, net of customer sharing (some items considered adjustments and excluded from adjusted earnings).

These drivers were partially offset by:

•lower retail sales volume, including the effects of COVID-19, weather, and storms;

•higher depreciation and interest expenses; 

•lower AFUDC due to completion of major construction projects; and

•regulatory provisions at E-AR and SERI (the provision at SERI was considered an adjustment and excluded from adjusted earnings).

On a per share basis, full year 2020 results reflected higher common shares outstanding.

Appendix C contains additional details on Utility financial and operating measures.

Parent & Other

For full year 2020, Parent & Other reported a loss attributable to Entergy Corporation of $(347 million), or $(1.73) per share, on an as-reported basis, and a loss of $(286 million), or $(1.42) per share, on an adjusted basis. This compared to a full year 2019 loss of $(316 million), or $(1.60) per share, on an as-reported basis, and a loss of $(305 million), or $(1.55) per share on an adjusted basis. A primary driver for the full year was income tax expense (some items considered adjustments and excluded from adjusted earnings). This was partially offset by the timing of a charitable contribution and interest expense.

On a per share basis, full year 2020 results reflected higher common shares outstanding.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities 

For full year 2020, EWC reported a loss attributable to Entergy Corporation of $(65 million), or (32) cents per share, on an as-reported basis. This compared to full year 2019 earnings attributable to Entergy Corporation of $147 million, or 74 cents per share, on an as-reported basis. Drivers for the year included:

•lower revenue primarily due to the shutdown of Indian Point 2 and Pilgrim;

•unfavorable income tax items in 2020 as compared to 2019; and

•lower gains on decommissioning trust funds.

These drivers were partially offset by:

•lower asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges as compared to a year ago; and

•lower operating expenses due to the shutdown of Indian Point 2 and Pilgrim.

On a per share basis, full year 2020 results reflected higher common shares outstanding.

Appendix D contains additional details on EWC financial and operating measures, including reconciliation for non-GAAP EWC adjusted EBITDA.

Earnings Per Share Guidance 

Entergy initiated its 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.80 to $6.10. See webcast presentation for additional details.

The company has provided 2021 earnings guidance with regard to the non-GAAP measure of Entergy adjusted EPS. This measure excludes from the corresponding GAAP financial measure the effect of adjustments as described below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” The company has not provided a reconciliation of such non-GAAP guidance to guidance presented on a GAAP basis because it cannot predict and quantify with a reasonable degree of confidence all of the adjustments that may occur during the period. One such adjustment will be the exclusion of EWC earnings from Entergy adjusted EPS. We currently estimate that the contribution of EWC to Entergy’s as-reported EPS will be approximately $(1.45) in 2021. These estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty due to, among other things, the potential effects of exiting the EWC business.

The telephone replay will be available through March 3, 2021, by dialing 855-859-2056, conference ID 6726389. 

Entergy Corporation is an integrated energy company engaged in electric power production, transmission and retail distribution operations. Entergy delivers electricity to 3 

million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Entergy owns and operates one of the cleanest large-scale U.S. power generating fleets with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, including 8,000 megawatts of nuclear power. Headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, Entergy has annual revenues of $10 billion and 13,400 employees.

Entergy Corporation’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Chicago under the symbol “ETR.”

Details regarding Entergy’s results of operations, regulatory proceedings, and other matters are available in this earnings release, a copy of which will be filed with the SEC, and the webcast presentation. Both documents are available on Entergy’s Investor Relations website at www.entergy.com/investor_relations. 

Entergy maintains a web page as part of its Investor Relations website, entitled Regulatory and Other Information, which provides investors with key updates of certain regulatory proceedings and important milestones on the execution of its strategy. While some of this information may be considered material information, investors should not rely exclusively on this page for all relevant company information.

For definitions of certain operating measures, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and abbreviations and acronyms used in the earnings release materials, see Appendix F. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This news release contains non-GAAP financial measures, which are generally numerical measures of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that either exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within this news release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 

Entergy reports earnings using the non-GAAP measure of Entergy adjusted earnings, which excludes the effect of certain “adjustments,” including the removal of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment in light of the company’s decision to exit the merchant power business. Adjustments are unusual or non-recurring items or events or other items or events that management believes do not reflect the ongoing business of Entergy, such as the results of the EWC segment, significant tax items, and other items such as certain costs, expenses, or other specified items. In addition to reporting GAAP consolidated earnings on a per share basis, Entergy reports its adjusted earnings on a per share basis. These per share measures represent the applicable earnings amount divided by the diluted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share for, among other things, financial planning and analysis; reporting financial results to the board of directors, employees, stockholders, analysts, and investors; and internal 

evaluation of financial performance. Entergy believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy’s business, comparing period to period results, and comparing Entergy’s financial performance to the financial performance of other companies in the utility sector.

Other non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA; adjusted ROE; adjusted ROE, excluding affiliate preferred; adjusted ROIC; gross liquidity; net liquidity; net liquidity, including storm escrows; debt to capital, excluding securitization debt; net debt to net capital, excluding securitization debt; parent debt to total debt, excluding securitization debt; FFO to debt, excluding securitization debt; and FFO to debt, excluding securitization debt, return of unprotected excess ADIT, and severance and retention payments associated with exit of EWC, are measures Entergy uses internally for management and board discussions and to gauge the overall strength of its business. Entergy believes the above data provides useful information to investors in evaluating Entergy’s ongoing financial results and flexibility, and assists investors in comparing Entergy’s credit and liquidity to the credit and liquidity of others in the utility sector. In addition, other financial measures including net income (or earnings) adjusted for preferred dividends and tax-effected interest expense and FFO are included on both an adjusted and an as-reported basis. In each case, the metrics defined as “adjusted” (other than EWC’s adjusted EBITDA) exclude the effect of adjustments as defined above. EWC’s adjusted EBITDA represents EWC’s earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, and also excludes decommissioning expense.

These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of Entergy’s operations that, when viewed with Entergy’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Entergy’s business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Investors are strongly encouraged to review Entergy’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Although certain of these measures are intended to assist investors in comparing Entergy’s performance to other companies in the utility sector, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it might not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

A: Consolidated Results and Adjustments

Appendix A-1 provides a comparative summary of consolidated earnings, including a reconciliation of as-reported earnings (GAAP) to adjusted earnings (non-GAAP). 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Calculations may differ due to rounding

(a)Per share amounts are calculated by dividing the corresponding earnings (loss) by the diluted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

See Appendix B for detailed earnings variance analysis.

Appendix A-2 provides a comparative summary of OCF, by business. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Calculations may differ due to rounding

OCF decreased quarter-over-quarter due primarily to non-capital storm costs, lower collections due to COVID-19, unfavorable weather, and decreased collections for fuel and purchased power cost recovery at the Utility. Higher severance and retention payments and higher nuclear refueling outage spending at EWC also contributed. Lower pension funding partially offset the quarterly decrease. 

OCF decreased year-over-year due primarily to non-capital storm costs, decreased collections for fuel and purchased power cost recovery, lower collections due to COVID-19, and unfavorable weather. The decrease was partially offset by a lower amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers, lower severance and retention payments at EWC, lower pension funding, and higher DOE proceeds.

For both the quarter and the full year, intercompany income tax payments contributed to the line of business variances but were immaterial at the consolidated level.

Appendix A-3 and Appendix A-4 list adjustments by business. Adjustments are included in as-reported earnings consistent with GAAP but are excluded from adjusted earnings. As a result, adjusted earnings is considered a non-GAAP measure.

(c)Utility operating revenue / regulatory charges, Utility other O&M, and Utility income taxes-other exclude $13 million, $- million, and $13 million respectively in fourth quarter 2020 and $52 million, $3 million, and $55 million respectively in fourth quarter 2019 for the return of unprotected excess ADIT to customers (net effect is neutral to earnings). On a full year basis, Utility operating revenue / regulatory charges, Utility other O&M, and Utility income taxes-other exclude $74 million, $- million, and $74 million respectively in 2020 and $268 million, $6 million, and $274 million respectively in 2019 (net effect is neutral to earnings).

(d)EPS effect is calculated by multiplying the pre-tax amount by the estimated income tax rate that is expected to apply and dividing by diluted average number of common shares outstanding for the prior period; income taxes–other represents income tax differences other than the tax effect of individual line items.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(e)The fourth quarter and full year earnings variances were primarily driven by E-AR’s FRP; E-LA’s FRP, including recovery of LCPS; E-MS’s FRP, vegetation rider, and recovery of Choctaw; and E-TX’s TCRF and DCRF. The variance also reflected three regulatory charges: first, a regulatory provision for E-AR’s FRP to account for the December 2020 APSC order; second, a regulatory liability for tax sharing with E-LA customers (partially offsets the hurricanes Katrina and Rita Act 55 income tax item discussed in footnote n); and third, a regulatory provision for a potential refund to reflect lower rate base retroactive to 2015 at SERI (classified as an adjustment). The variances also reflected lower volume/weather, including the effects of COVID-19 and hurricanes, as well as E-NO’s rate case. The full year variance also reflected recovery of the J. Wayne Leonard Power Station, a first quarter 2019 regulatory reserve at E-AR, and a regulatory liability for tax sharing with E-LA customers (partially offsets the Hurricane Isaac Act 55 income tax item discussed in footnote n).

(f)The fourth quarter and full year earnings decreases were due largely to lower revenues from the shutdown of Indian Point 2 in April 2020. The full year variance also reflected lower revenues from the shutdown of Pilgrim in May 2019.

(g)The fourth quarter earnings decrease from higher Utility other O&M was due primarily to higher non-nuclear generation expenses related to timing and scope of outages and plant costs for LCPS and Choctaw, and higher transmission costs, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits costs and a write-off of scrubbers at White Bluff in 2019. In addition to the items mentioned above, the full year earnings increase was due primarily to lower nuclear generation expenses, lower contract costs related to new customer initiatives, lower non-nuclear generation expenses, higher nuclear insurance refunds, and a decrease in loss provisions. These were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits costs, primarily pension. 

(h)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases from lower EWC other O&M were due largely to the shutdown of Indian Point 2 in April 2020. The full year variance also reflected the shutdown of Pilgrim in May 2019, as well as a decrease in severance and retention expense.

(i)The fourth quarter and full year earnings decreases from higher Utility depreciation expense were due primarily to higher plant in service, including LCPS and Choctaw. The full year variance also reflected the J. Wayne Leonard Power Station being placed in service in second quarter 2019, as well as higher depreciation rates at E-MS.

(j)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases from lower EWC depreciation expense were due primarily to the shutdown of Indian Point 2 in April 2020. The full year variance also reflected the shutdown of Pilgrim in May 2019.

(k)The fourth quarter earnings increase from higher Utility other income (deductions)–other was due largely to changes in decommissioning trust fund returns (based on regulatory treatment, decommissioning-related variances are largely earnings neutral). The full year earnings decrease from lower Utility other income (deductions)–other was due primarily to lower AFUDC as a result of lower construction work in progress in 2020 and higher non-service pension and OPEB costs, partially offset by changes in decommissioning trust fund returns (based on regulatory treatment, decommissioning-related variances are largely earnings neutral).

(l)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increase from Parent & Other other income (deductions)–other was due primarily to the timing of a charitable contribution and intercompany interest.

(m)The fourth quarter earnings increase from higher EWC other income (deductions)–other was due largely to performance of nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments in 2020 as compared to 2019. The full year earnings decrease was due largely to performance of nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments in 2020 as compared to 2019, as well as the repayment of an intercompany loan, partially offset by a $16 million pension settlement charge in third quarter 2019 related to the exit of the EWC business.

(n)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases from Utility income taxes-other reflected two fourth quarter 2020 items and one fourth quarter 2019 item. In fourth quarter 2020, a settlement of the 2014 / 2015 IRS audit resulted in a $396 million tax benefit (classified as an adjustment), as well as a $31 million tax benefit related to Act 55 financing of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita costs (partly offset by customer sharing, recorded as a regulatory charge discussed in footnote e). In fourth quarter 2019, a $41 million income tax item was generated through the reversal of a valuation allowance generated as part of the 2018 internal restructuring (classified as an adjustment). The full year earnings increase also reflected two first quarter 2020 items. First, a $55 million tax benefit was recorded as a result of an IRS settlement related to Act 55 financing of Hurricane Isaac costs (partly offset by customer sharing, recorded as a regulatory charge discussed in footnote e); and second, an annual tax accrual related to stock-based compensation resulted in an income tax benefit of $22 million, $20 million greater than first quarter 2019. Additional annual true-ups totaling $19 million also contributed to the variance.

(o)The fourth quarter and full year earnings decreases from Parent & Other income taxes-other reflected one fourth quarter 2020 item and one fourth quarter 2019 item. In fourth quarter 2020, a settlement of the 2014 / 2015 IRS audit resulted in $61 million of tax expense (classified as an adjustment). In fourth quarter 2019, a valuation allowance recorded on the expected interest limitation carryover resulted in $11 million of tax expense related to tax year 2018 (classified as an adjustment) and approximately $11 million of tax expense related to tax year 2019. The full year variance also reflected $23 million of income tax expense recorded in first quarter 2020 as a result of the IRS settlement related to the Hurricane Isaac Act 55 financing (discussed in footnote n).

(p)The fourth quarter and full year earnings decreases from EWC income taxes-other reflected one fourth quarter 2020 item and three fourth quarter 2019 items. In fourth quarter 2020, a settlement of the 2014 / 2015 IRS audit resulted in $104 million of tax expense. In fourth quarter 2019, first, a restructuring within the EWC business resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of $156 million. Second, a donation to the State University of New York triggered the recognition of an associated tax deduction, resulting in a decrease to tax expense of $19 million. Third, an EWC subsidiary recognized a reduction in tax expense of $18 million. The full year earnings decrease was partly offset by a first quarter 2019 accrual of $29 million of tax expense, which resulted from the sale of Vermont Yankee in January 2019.

(q)The full year earnings increase from lower Utility nuclear refueling outage expense was due to decreased amortization of ANO Unit 2 refueling outage costs.

(r)The full year earnings increase from lower EWC asset write-offs and impairments were due primarily to a $191 million loss (pre-tax) on the sale of Pilgrim in third quarter 2019 and higher impairment charges in first quarter 2019, largely refueling outage costs at Indian Point 3. 

(s)The full year earnings increase from lower EWC decommissioning expense was due to the sale of Pilgrim in 2019.

(t)The full year earnings decrease from higher Utility taxes other than income taxes was due primarily to an increase in ad valorem taxes at E-LA and E-AR.

(u)The full year earnings decrease from higher Utility interest expense was due primarily to higher debt balances at E-TX, E-LA, E-AR, and E-MS.

(v)The earnings per share impacts from share effect were due to settlement of the equity forward (8.4 million shares settled in May 2019).

C: Utility Financial and Operating Measures 

Appendix C-1 and Appendix C-2 provide comparative summaries of Utility operating and financial measures.

a.The effects of weather were estimated using heating degree days and cooling degree days for the billing cycles from certain locations within each jurisdiction and comparing to “normal” weather based on 20-year historical data. The models used to estimate weather are updated periodically and are subject to change.

On a weather-adjusted basis for fourth quarter 2020, billed retail sales decreased (2.3) percent, including the impacts from COVID-19 and hurricanes. Residential billed sales increased 3.4 percent and commercial billed sales decreased (4.6) percent. Industrial billed sales volume decreased (4.3) percent reflecting lower sales to existing small and large customers, partially offset by growth from new/expansion customers.

On a weather-adjusted basis for full year 2020, retail billed sales decreased (2.1) percent, including the impacts from COVID-19 and hurricanes. Residential billed sales increased 2.7 percent and commercial billed sales decreased (6.5). Industrial billed sales volume decreased (2.8) percent reflecting lower sales to existing large and small customers, partially offset by growth from new/expansion customers.
