Adoption of Inducement Plan  

On February 11, 2021, Intel Corporation’s (“Intel’s”) Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved and adopted the Intel Corporation 2021 Inducement Plan (the “Inducement Plan”). The Inducement Plan provides for the grant of equity or equity-based awards in the form of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and other stock-based awards. The Inducement Plan’s terms are substantially similar to the terms of Intel’s 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, with the addition of certain terms and conditions intended to comply with the Nasdaq inducement award exception. The Inducement Plan was adopted by the Board without stockholder approval pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.  

The Board has reserved 8,000,000 shares of Intel’s common stock for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the Inducement Plan (subject to customary adjustments in the event of a change in capital structure of Intel) and has appointed the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) to administer the Inducement Plan. Awards under the Inducement Plan may be granted only to employees who satisfy the standards for inducement grants under Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and only when the award is an inducement material to such individual’s entering into employment with Intel and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) within the meaning of Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.  

Patrick Gelsinger, Intel’s Chief Executive Officer, is the only participant in the Inducement Plan, and the awards previously disclosed in connection with Mr. Gelsinger’s appointment as Chief Executive Officer and entry into an offer letter with Intel on January 13, 2021, are the only awards that will be granted under the Inducement Plan. Such awards are described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 14, 2021. In addition, Mr. Gelsinger elected to purchase $10 million in Intel shares from Intel, referred to in such Form 8-K as the “Investment Shares,” and thus will be eligible to receive a grant under the Inducement Plan of matching restricted stock units covering a number of Intel shares roughly equal to the number of Investment Shares, which matching grant is described in such Form 8-K and offer letter.  

The Inducement Plan is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 99.1 of Intel’s registration statement on Form S-8, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2021, Commission File No. 333-253077. The foregoing description of the terms of the Inducement Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text thereof.
