 Item 7.01  

Regulation FD Disclosure  

During the 39th Annual J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference on January 12, 2021, Albert Bourla, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer Inc. (the “Company” or “Pfizer”), provided the following preliminary financial guidance for the Company for 2021:  

Based on a preliminary view, the Company projects 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)* in a range of $3.00 - $3.10.  

This preliminary financial guidance is subject to a number of assumptions, factors and uncertainties, including, among others, the Company’s current expectations and assumptions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 vaccine supply and contracts, which remain dynamic. The Company expects to provide further details when it issues its financial guidance in connection with its press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020 on February 2, 2021. 

* Adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. GAAP net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items (some of which may recur, such as gains on the completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or gains and losses from equity securities, but which management does not believe are reflective of ongoing core operations). As described in the Financial Review––Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income) section of Pfizer’s 2019 Financial Report, which was filed as Exhibit 13 to Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, management uses Adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. Because Adjusted income is an important internal measurement for Pfizer, management believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. Pfizer reports Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income, and Adjusted diluted EPS in order to portray the results of the Company’s major operations—the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines and vaccines—prior to considering certain income statement elements. The Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. Pfizer does not provide guidance for GAAP reported financial measures (other than revenues) or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial measures on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, gains and losses from equity securities and potential future asset impairments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period.  

The information contained in Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any registration statement or other document filed under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.  

Forward-Looking Statements

This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements about our anticipated future financial performance that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
