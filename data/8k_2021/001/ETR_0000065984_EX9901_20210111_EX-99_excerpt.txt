[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The purpose of this communication (this “Master Confirmation”) is to set forth the terms and conditions of the transactions to be entered into from time to time between Bank of America, N.A. (“Dealer”) and Entergy Corporation (“Counterparty”) in accordance with the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, dated as of January 11, 2021 (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”), among Dealer, BofA Securities, Inc. and Counterparty, among others, on one or more Trade Dates specified herein (collectively, the “Transactions” and each, a “Transaction”). This communication constitutes a “Confirmation” as referred to in the Agreement specified below. Each Transaction will be evidenced by a supplemental confirmation (each, a “Supplemental Confirmation,” and each such Supplemental Confirmation, together with this Master Confirmation, a “Confirmation” for purposes of the Agreement specified below) substantially in the form of Schedule A hereto. Each Confirmation will be a confirmation for purposes of Rule 10b-10 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). 

1.Each Confirmation is subject to, and incorporates, the 2000 ISDA Definitions (the “2000 Definitions”) and the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the “Equity Definitions”), each as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”). For purposes of the Equity Definitions, each Transaction will be deemed to be a Share Forward Transaction.

Each Confirmation shall supplement, form a part of and be subject to an agreement (the “Agreement”) in the form of the ISDA 2002 Master Agreement (the “ISDA Form”), as published by ISDA, as if Dealer and Counterparty had executed the ISDA Form on the date hereof (but without any Schedule except for the election of New York law (without regard to New York’s choice of laws doctrine other than Title 14 of Article 5 of the New York General Obligations Law (the “General Obligations Law”)) as the governing law and US Dollars (“USD”) as the Termination Currency.

All provisions contained in the Agreement are incorporated into and shall govern each Confirmation except as expressly modified below. Each Confirmation evidences a complete and binding agreement between Dealer and Counterparty as to the terms of the relevant Transaction and replaces any previous agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

The Transactions hereunder shall be the sole Transactions under the Agreement. If there exists any ISDA Master Agreement between Dealer or any of its Affiliates and Counterparty or any confirmation or other agreement between Dealer or any of its Affiliates and Counterparty pursuant to which an ISDA Master Agreement is deemed to exist between Dealer or any of its Affiliates and Counterparty, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such ISDA Master Agreement, such confirmation or agreement or any other agreement to which Dealer or such other Affiliates and Counterparty are parties, the Transactions shall not be considered Transactions under, or otherwise governed by, such existing or deemed ISDA Master Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency among the Agreement, this Master Confirmation, any Supplemental Confirmation and the Equity Definitions, the following will prevail in the order of precedence indicated: (i) such Supplemental Confirmation; (ii) this Master Confirmation; (iii) the Equity Definitions; (iv) the 2000 Definitions; and (v) the Agreement.

Valuation Disruption: If Cash Settlement is applicable with respect to any Transaction and any Unwind Date during the related Unwind Period is a Disrupted Day, the Calculation Agent shall determine whether (i) such Disrupted Day is a Disrupted Day in full, in which case the 10b-18 VWAP for such Disrupted Day shall not be included in the calculation of the Settlement Price, or (ii) such Disrupted Day is a Disrupted Day only in part, in which case the 10b-18 VWAP for such Disrupted Day shall be determined by the Calculation Agent based on Rule 10b-18 eligible transactions (as defined below) in the Shares on such Disrupted Day, taking into account the nature and duration of the relevant Market Disruption Event, and the weightings of the 10b-18 VWAP and the Forward Prices for each Unwind Date during such Unwind Period shall be adjusted in a commercially reasonable manner by the Calculation Agent for purposes of determining the Settlement Price and the Relevant Forward Price, as applicable, to account for the occurrence of such partially Disrupted Day, with such adjustments based on, among other factors, the duration of any Market Disruption Event and the volume, historical trading patterns and price of the Shares.

Market Disruption Event: The definition of “Market Disruption Event” in Section 6.3(a) of the Equity Definitions is hereby amended by deleting the words “at any time during the one-hour period that ends at the relevant Valuation Time, Latest Exercise Time, Knock-in Valuation Time or Knock-out Valuation Time, as the case may be” and inserting the words “at any time on any Exchange Business Day during the Unwind Period” after the word “material,” in the third line thereof.

Settlement Terms:

Settlement: With respect to any Transaction, any Physical Settlement, Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement of all or any portion of such Transaction.

Settlement Notice: For any Transaction, subject to “Early Valuation” below, Counterparty may elect to effect a Settlement of all or any portion of such Transaction by designating one or more Scheduled Trading Days following the Effective Date for such Transaction and on or prior to the Maturity Date for such Transaction to be Valuation Dates (or, with respect to Cash Settlements or Net Share Settlements of such Transaction, First Unwind Dates, each of which First Unwind Dates shall occur no later than the 30th Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date for such Transaction) in a written notice to Dealer (a “Settlement Notice”) delivered no later than the applicable Settlement Method 

4

Election Date for such Transaction, which notice shall also specify (i) the number of Shares (the “Settlement Shares”) for such Settlement (not to exceed the number of Undesignated Shares for such Transaction as of the date of such Settlement Notice) and (ii) the Settlement Method applicable to such Settlement; provided that (A) Counterparty may not designate a First Unwind Date for a Cash Settlement or a Net Share Settlement of any Transaction if, as of the date of such Settlement Notice, any Shares have been designated as Settlement Shares for a Cash Settlement or a Net Share Settlement of such Transaction for which the related Relevant Settlement Date has not occurred; and (B) if the number of Undesignated Shares as of the Maturity Date for such Transaction is not zero, then the Maturity Date for such Transaction shall be a Valuation Date for a Physical Settlement of such Transaction and the number of Settlement Shares for such Settlement shall be the number of Undesignated Shares for such Transaction as of the Maturity Date for such Transaction (provided that if such Maturity Date occurs during the period from the time any Settlement Notice is given for a Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement of such Transaction until the related Relevant Settlement Date, inclusive, then the provisions set forth below opposite “Early Valuation” shall apply to such Transaction as if the Maturity Date for such Transaction were the Early Valuation Date for such Transaction).

Undesignated Shares: For any Transaction, as of any date, the Number of Shares for such Transaction minus the number of Shares designated as Settlement Shares for Settlements of such Transaction for which the related Relevant Settlement Date has not occurred.

Settlement Method Election: For any Transaction, applicable; provided that:

(i) Net Share Settlement shall be deemed to be included as an additional settlement method under Section 7.1 of the Equity Definitions;

(ii) Counterparty may elect Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement for any Settlement of any Transaction only if Counterparty represents and warrants to Dealer in the Settlement Notice containing such election that, as of the date of such Settlement Notice, (A) Counterparty is not aware of any material nonpublic information concerning itself or the Shares, (B) Counterparty is electing the settlement method and designating the First Unwind Date specified in such Settlement Notice in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade compliance with Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10b-5”) or any other provision of the federal securities laws, (C) Counterparty is not “insolvent” (as such term is defined under Section 101(32) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code) (the “Bankruptcy Code”)), (D) Counterparty would be able to purchase a number of Shares equal to the greater of (x) the number of Settlement Shares designated in such Settlement Notice and (y) a number of Shares with a value as of the date of such Settlement Notice equal to the product of (I) such number of Settlement Shares and (II) the applicable Relevant Forward Price for such Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement in compliance with the laws of Counterparty’s jurisdiction of organization and (E) such election, and settlement in accordance therewith, does not and will not violate or conflict with any law or regulation applicable to Counterparty, or any order or judgment of any court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets, and any governmental consents that are required to have been obtained by Counterparty with respect to such election or settlement have been obtained and are in full force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been complied with; and

(iii) Notwithstanding any election to the contrary in any Settlement Notice, Physical Settlement shall be applicable for any Settlement of any Transaction:

5

(A) to all of the Settlement Shares designated in such Settlement Notice if, at any time from the date such Settlement Notice is received by Dealer until the related First Unwind Date, inclusive, Dealer determines, in its good faith and commercially reasonable judgment, that it would, after using commercially reasonable efforts, be unable to purchase a number of Shares in the market sufficient to unwind a commercially reasonable hedge position in respect of the portion of the Transaction represented by such Settlement Shares and satisfy its delivery obligation hereunder, if any, by the Maturity Date (x) in a manner that (A) would, if Dealer were Counterparty or an affiliated purchaser of Counterparty, and taking into account any other Transactions hereunder or under a substantially similar issuer forward or similar transaction with Dealer with an overlapping unwind period, be in compliance with, the safe harbor provided by Rule 10b-18(b) under the Exchange Act and (B) based on advice of counsel, would not raise material risks under applicable securities laws or (y) due to the lack of sufficient liquidity in the Shares (each, a “Trading Condition”); or

(B) to all or a portion of the Settlement Shares designated in such Settlement Notice if, on any day during the relevant Unwind Period, Dealer determines, in its good faith and commercially reasonable judgment or based on advice of counsel, as applicable, that a Trading Condition has occurred with respect to such Transaction, in which case the provisions set forth below in the fourth paragraph opposite “Early Valuation” shall apply as if such day were the Early Valuation Date for such Transaction and (x) for purposes of clause (i) of such paragraph, such day shall be the last Unwind Date of such Unwind Period and the “Unwound Shares” shall be calculated to, and including, such day and (y) for purposes of clause (ii) of such paragraph, the “Remaining Shares” shall be equal to the number of Settlement Shares designated in such Settlement Notice minus the Unwound Shares determined in accordance with clause (x) of this sentence.

Electing Party: Counterparty

Settlement Method Election Date: With respect to any Settlement of any Transaction, the 2nd Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding (x) the Valuation Date for such Transaction, in the case of Physical Settlement, or (y) the First Unwind Date for such Transaction, in the case of Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement. 

Default Settlement Method: Physical Settlement

Physical Settlement: Notwithstanding Section 9.2(a)(i) of the Equity Definitions, on the Settlement Date for any Physical Settlement of any Transaction, Dealer shall pay to Counterparty an amount in USD (the “Physical Settlement Amount”) equal to the Forward Price for such Transaction on the relevant Settlement Date multiplied by the number of Settlement Shares for such Settlement, and Counterparty shall deliver to Dealer such Settlement Shares. If, on any Settlement Date, the Settlement Shares to be delivered by Counterparty to Dealer hereunder are not so delivered (the “Deferred Shares”), and a Forward Price Reduction Date occurs during the period from, and including, such Settlement Date to, but excluding, the date such Settlement Shares are actually delivered to Dealer, then the portion of the Physical Settlement Amount payable by Dealer to Counterparty in respect of the Deferred Shares shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Forward Price Reduction Amount for such Forward Price Reduction Date, multiplied by the number of Deferred Shares.

6

Settlement Date: For any Settlement of any Transaction to which Physical Settlement is applicable, the Valuation Date for such Settlement.

Net Share Settlement: On the Net Share Settlement Date for any Settlement of any Transaction to which Net Share Settlement is applicable, if the Net Share Settlement Amount for such Settlement is greater than zero, Counterparty shall deliver a number of Shares equal to such Net Share Settlement Amount (rounded down to the nearest integer) to Dealer, and if such Net Share Settlement Amount is less than zero, Dealer shall deliver a number of Shares equal to the absolute value of such Net Share Settlement Amount (rounded down to the nearest integer) to Counterparty, in either case, in accordance with Section 9.4 of the Equity Definitions, with such Net Share Settlement Date deemed to be a “Settlement Date” for purposes of such Section 9.4, and, in either case, plus cash in lieu of any fractional Shares included in such Net Share Settlement Amount but not delivered due to rounding required hereby, valued at the relevant Settlement Price.

Net Share Settlement Date: For any Settlement of any Transaction to which Net Share Settlement is applicable, the date that follows the Valuation Date for such Settlement by one Settlement Cycle.

Net Share Settlement Amount: For any Settlement of any Transaction to which Net Share Settlement is applicable, an amount equal to the Forward Cash Settlement Amount for such Settlement divided by the Settlement Price for such Settlement.

Cash Settlement: On the Cash Settlement Payment Date for any Settlement of any Transaction to which Cash Settlement is applicable, if the Forward Cash Settlement Amount is a positive number, then Counterparty shall pay to Dealer the Forward Cash Settlement Amount on the relevant Cash Settlement Payment Date, and if the Forward Cash Settlement Amount is a negative number, then Dealer shall pay to Counterparty the absolute value of the Forward Cash Settlement Amount on the relevant Cash Settlement Payment Date.

Cash Settlement Payment Date: For any Settlement of any Transaction to which Cash Settlement is applicable, the date that follows the Valuation Date for such Settlement by one Settlement Cycle.

Forward Cash Settlement Amount: Notwithstanding Section 8.5(c) of the Equity Definitions, the Forward Cash Settlement Amount for any Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement of any Transaction shall be equal to (i) the number of Settlement Shares for such Settlement multiplied by (ii) an amount equal to (A) the Settlement Price for such Settlement minus (B) the Relevant Forward Price for such Settlement.

Relevant Forward Price: For any Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement of any Transaction, subject to “Valuation Disruption” above, the arithmetic average of the Forward Prices for such Transaction on each Unwind Date relating to such Settlement.

Settlement Price: For any Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement of any Transaction, subject to “Valuation Disruption” above, the arithmetic average of the 10b-18 VWAP on each Unwind Date relating to such Settlement, plus a commercially reasonable amount determined by the Calculation Agent that in no event will exceed USD 0.01.

10b-18 VWAP: For any Exchange Business Day, as determined by the Calculation Agent based on the 10b-18 Volume Weighted Average Price per Share as reported in the composite transactions for United States exchanges and quotation systems for the regular trading session (including any extensions thereof) of the Exchange on such Exchange Business Day (without regard to pre-open or after hours trading outside of such regular trading session for such Exchange Business Day), as published by Bloomberg at 4:15 p.m. New York time (or 15 minutes following the end of any extension of the regular trading 

7

session) on such Exchange Business Day, on Bloomberg page “ETR <Equity> AQR_SEC” (or any successor thereto), or if such price is not so reported on such Exchange Business Day for any reason or is, in the Calculation Agent’s reasonable determination, erroneous, such 10b-18 VWAP shall be as reasonably determined by the Calculation Agent.  For purposes of calculating the 10b-18 VWAP for such Exchange Business Day, the Calculation Agent will include only those trades that are reported during the period of time during which Counterparty could purchase its own shares under Rule 10b-18(b)(2) and are effected pursuant to the conditions of Rule 10b-18(b)(3), each under the Exchange Act (such trades, “Rule 10b-18 eligible transactions”).

Unwind Activities: The times and prices at which Dealer (or its agent or affiliate) purchases any Shares during any Unwind Period in connection with unwinding its commercially reasonable hedge position in respect of each Transaction shall be determined by Dealer in a commercially reasonable manner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that Dealer concludes, in its good faith and reasonable discretion based on advice of counsel, that it is appropriate with respect to any legal, regulatory or self-regulatory requirements or related policies and procedures (whether or not such requirements, policies or procedures are imposed by law or have been voluntarily adopted by Dealer generally in its business) (a “Regulatory Disruption”), for it to refrain from purchasing Shares in connection with unwinding its commercially reasonable hedge position in respect of such Transaction on any Scheduled Trading Day that would have been an Unwind Date but for the occurrence of a Regulatory Disruption, Dealer may (but shall not be required to) notify Counterparty in writing that a Regulatory Disruption has occurred on such Scheduled Trading Day with respect to such Transaction, in which case Dealer shall, to the extent practicable in its good faith discretion, specify the nature of such Regulatory Disruption, and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Scheduled Trading Day shall not be an Unwind Date for such Transaction and such Regulatory Disruption shall be deemed to be a Market Disruption Event; provided that Dealer may exercise its right to suspend under this sentence only in good faith in relation to events or circumstances that are not the result of actions of it or any of its Affiliates that are taken with the intent to avoid its obligations under the Transactions.

Relevant Settlement Date: For any Settlement of any Transaction, the Settlement Date, Cash Settlement Payment Date or Net Share Settlement Date for such Settlement, as the case may be.

Other Applicable Provisions: To the extent Dealer is obligated to deliver Shares under any Transaction, the provisions of Sections 9.2 (last sentence only), 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, 9.11 and 9.12 of the Equity Definitions will be applicable as if “Physical Settlement” applied to such Transaction; provided that the Representation and Agreement contained in Section 9.11 of the Equity Definitions shall be modified by excluding any representations therein relating to restrictions, obligations, limitations or requirements under applicable securities laws that exist as a result of the fact that Counterparty is the issuer of the Shares. 

Share Adjustments:

Potential Adjustment Events: An Extraordinary Dividend shall not constitute a Potential Adjustment Event. For the avoidance of doubt, a cash dividend on the Shares that differs from expected dividends as of the first Trading Day of the Forward Hedge Selling Period for such Transaction shall not be a Potential Adjustment Event under Section 11.2(e)(vii) of the Equity Definitions with respect to such Transaction.

Extraordinary Dividend: For any Transaction, any dividend or distribution on the Shares with an ex-dividend date occurring on any day following the first Trading Day of the Forward Hedge Selling Period for such Transaction (other than (i) any dividend or distribution of the type 

8

described in Section 11.2(e)(i) or Section 11.2(e)(ii)(A) of the Equity Definitions or (ii) a regular, quarterly cash dividend in an amount equal to or less than the Regular Dividend Amount for such calendar quarter for such Transaction that has an ex-dividend date no earlier than the Forward Price Reduction Date occurring in the relevant quarter for such Transaction).

Regular Dividend Amount: For each Transaction and for each calendar quarter, the amount set forth under the heading “Regular Dividend Amounts” in the Accepted Placement Notice for such Transaction and for such calendar quarter (or, if no such amount is specified, zero), as specified in Schedule I to the Supplemental Confirmation for such Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, Counterparty may not specify a Regular Dividend Amount in an Accepted Placement Notice for a particular calendar quarter that exceeds the Forward Price Reduction Amount for the Forward Price Reduction Date that occurs in such calendar quarter (or, if none, that exceeds zero).

Method of Adjustment: Calculation Agent Adjustment

Extraordinary Events:

Extraordinary Events: The consequences that would otherwise apply under Article 12 of the Equity Definitions to any applicable Extraordinary Event (excluding any Failure to Deliver, Increased Cost of Stock Borrow or any Extraordinary Event that also constitutes a Bankruptcy Termination Event, but including, for the avoidance of doubt, any other applicable Additional Disruption Event) shall not apply.

Tender Offer: Applicable; provided that Section 12.1(d) of the Equity Definitions shall be amended by replacing the reference therein to “10%” with a reference to “20%”.

Delisting: In addition to the provisions of Section 12.6(a)(iii) of the Equity Definitions, it shall also constitute a Delisting if the Exchange is located in the United States and the Shares are not immediately re-listed, re-traded or re-quoted on any of the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NASDAQ Global Market (or their respective successors); if the Shares are immediately re-listed, re-traded or re-quoted on any such exchange or quotation system, such exchange or quotation system shall be deemed to be the Exchange.

Additional Disruption Events:

Change in Law: Applicable; provided that (A) any determination as to whether (i) the adoption of or any change in any applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, any tax law) or (ii) the promulgation of or any change in or public announcement of the formal or informal interpretation by any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any applicable law or regulation (including any action taken by a taxing authority), in each case, constitutes a “Change in Law” shall be made without regard to Section 739 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 or any similar legal certainty provision in any legislation enacted, or rule or regulation promulgated, on or after the Trade Date, (B) Section 12.9(a)(ii) of the Equity Definitions is hereby amended (i) by adding the words “(including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, adoption or promulgation of new regulations authorized or mandated by existing statute)” after the word “regulation” in the second line thereof and (ii) by replacing the words “the interpretation” with the words “or public announcement of any formal or informal interpretation” in the third line thereof and (C) the words “, unless the illegality is due to an act or omission of the party seeking to elect termination of the Transaction with the intent to avoid its obligations under the terms of the 

9

Transaction” are added at the end of clause (X) thereof; and provided further that Section 12.9(a)(ii) of the Equity Definitions is hereby amended by adding the phrase “and/or Hedge Position” after the word “Shares” in clause (X) thereof and (iii) by immediately following the word “Transaction” in clause (X) thereof, adding the phrase “in the manner contemplated by the Hedging Party on the Trade Date”; and provided further that the “Materially Increased Costs Provision below shall apply.

Materially Increased Costs Provision: Upon the occurrence of any Change in Law specified in clause (Y) of the definition thereof, Dealer and Counterparty agree to negotiate in good faith for at least five Exchange Business Days (or until such earlier date as an agreement is reached) (any such period of negotiation, the “Amendment Period”) to amend this Master Forward Confirmation and/or any Supplemental Confirmation to take account of the resulting “materially increased cost” as such phrase is used in clause (Y) of the definition of “Change in Law.” Such amendment may, if agreed by Dealer and Counterparty, result in a Change in Law to which an ISDA Event applies. If, after negotiating in good faith during the Amendment Period to so amend this Master Forward Confirmation and/or the relevant Supplemental Confirmation, Dealer and Counterparty are unable to agree upon such an amendment, the relevant Change in Law specified in clause (Y) of the definition thereof shall constitute an ISDA Event. The Calculation Agent may, in connection with the designation of an Early Valuation Date following such ISDA Event, reduce the Forward Price for the relevant Transaction to compensate Dealer for any “materially increased costs” incurred during the relevant Amendment Period. Any Change in Law that results in an actual cost to Dealer of borrowing a number of Shares equal to the Number of Shares for the relevant Transaction to hedge its exposure to such Transaction that is equal to or less than a rate equal to the Maximum Stock Loan Rate for such Transaction shall not constitute a “materially increased cost” for purposes of clause (Y) of the definition of “Change in Law” as a result of such cost.

Failure to Deliver: Applicable with respect to a Transaction if Dealer is required to deliver Shares under such Transaction; otherwise, Not Applicable. 

Hedging Disruption: Applicable

Increased Cost of Hedging: Not Applicable.

Increased Cost of Stock Borrow: Applicable; provided that (x) Section 12.9(a)(viii) of the Equity Definitions shall be amended by replacing the phrase “Shares in respect of such Transaction” with the phrase “Shares with respect to such Transaction in an amount equal to the Hedging Shares (not to exceed the number of Shares underlying the Transaction)” and (y) Section 12.9(b)(v) of the Equity Definitions shall be amended by (i) adding the word “or” before clause (B) of the second sentence thereof, (ii) deleting clause (C) of the second sentence thereof and (iii) deleting the third, fourth and fifth sentences thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, upon the announcement of any event that, if consummated, would result in a Merger Event or Tender Offer, the term “rate to borrow Shares” as used in Section 12.9(a)(viii) of the Equity Definitions shall include any commercially reasonable cost borne or amount payable by the Hedging Party in respect of maintaining or reestablishing its commercially reasonable hedge position with respect to the relevant Transaction, including, but not limited to, any assessment or other amount payable by the Hedging Party to a lender of Shares in respect of any merger or tender offer premium, as applicable.

10

Initial Stock Loan Rate: For each Transaction, as specified in the Supplemental Confirmation for such Transaction.

Loss of Stock Borrow: Applicable; provided that Section 12.9(b)(iv) of the Equity Definitions shall be amended by (i) deleting clause (A) of the first sentence thereof in its entirety and (ii) replacing the words “neither the Non-Hedging Party nor the Lending Party lends” with “the Lending Party does not lend” in the second sentence thereof.

Maximum Stock Loan Rate: For each Transaction, as specified in the Supplemental Confirmation for such Transaction.

Hedging Party: For all applicable Additional Disruption Events, Dealer

Determining Party: For all applicable Extraordinary Events, Dealer

Early Valuation:

For the avoidance of doubt, any amount calculated pursuant to this “Early Valuation” section as a result of an Extraordinary Dividend shall not be adjusted by the value associated with such Extraordinary Dividend.

Dealer represents and warrants to and agrees with Counterparty that (i) based upon advice of counsel and the Threshold Number of Shares and Threshold Regulatory Number of Shares notified to Dealer pursuant to Section 10, Dealer (A) does not know of the existence on the first Trading Day of the relevant Forward Hedge Selling Period of an Excess Section 13 Ownership Position, an Excess NYSE Ownership Position or an Excess Regulatory Ownership Position and (B) based on reasonable internal inquiry in the ordinary course of Dealer’s business does not know on the first Trading Day of the relevant Forward Hedge Selling Period of any event or circumstance that will cause the occurrence of an Excess Section 13 Ownership Position, an Excess NYSE Ownership Position or an Excess Regulatory Ownership Position on any day during the term of such Transaction; and (ii) Dealer will not knowingly cause the occurrence of an Excess Section 13 Ownership Position, an Excess NYSE Ownership Position or an Excess Regulatory Ownership Position on any day during the term of any Transaction for the purpose, in whole or in part, of causing the occurrence of an Early Valuation Date.

If an Early Valuation Date for a Transaction occurs on a date that is not during an Unwind Period for such Transaction, then such Early Valuation Date shall be a Valuation Date for a Physical Settlement of such Transaction, and the number of Settlement Shares for such Settlement shall be the Number of Shares on such Early Valuation Date; provided that Dealer may in its sole discretion permit Counterparty to elect Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement in respect of such Transaction.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Master Confirmation, any Supplemental Confirmation, the Agreement or the Equity Definitions, if Dealer designates an Early Valuation Date with respect to a Transaction following the occurrence of an ISDA Event and such Early Valuation Date is to occur before the date that is one Settlement Cycle after the last day of the Forward Hedge Selling Period for such Transaction, then, for purposes of such Early Valuation Date, (i) a Supplemental Confirmation relating to such Transaction shall, notwithstanding the provisions under Section 3 below, be deemed to be effective; and (ii) the Forward Price shall be deemed to be the Initial Forward Price (calculated assuming that the last Trading Day of such Forward Hedge Selling Period was the day immediately following the date Dealer so notifies Counterparty of such designation of an Early Valuation Date for purposes of such Early Valuation Date).

If an Early Valuation Date for a Transaction occurs during an Unwind Period for such Transaction, then (i) (A) the last Unwind Date of such Unwind Period shall be deemed to be such Early Valuation Date, (B) a Settlement shall occur in respect of such Unwind Period, and the Settlement Method elected by Counterparty in respect of such Settlement shall apply, and (C) the number of Settlement Shares for such Settlement shall be the number of Unwound Shares for such Unwind Period on such Early Valuation Date, and (ii) (A) such Early Valuation Date shall be a Valuation Date for an additional Physical Settlement of such Transaction (provided that Dealer may in its sole discretion elect that the Settlement Method elected by Counterparty for the Settlement described in clause (i) of this sentence shall apply) and (B) the number of Settlement Shares for such additional Physical Settlement shall be the number of Remaining Shares on such Early Valuation Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Nationalization or Merger Event, if at the time of the related Relevant Settlement Date the Shares have changed into cash or any other property or the right to receive cash or any other property, the Calculation Agent shall adjust the nature of the Shares as it determines appropriate in a commercially reasonable manner to account for such change such that the nature of the Shares is consistent with what shareholders receive in such event.

ISDA Event: (i) Any Event of Default or Termination Event, other than an Event of Default or Termination Event that also constitutes a Bankruptcy Termination Event, that gives rise to the right of either party to designate an Early Termination Date pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement or (ii) the announcement of any event or transaction on or after the first Trading Day of the Forward Hedge Selling Period for such Transaction that, if consummated, would result in a Merger Event, Tender Offer, Nationalization, Delisting or Change in Law, in each case, as reasonably determined by the Calculation Agent. 

Amendment to Merger Event: Section 12.1(b) of the Equity Definitions is hereby amended by deleting the remainder of such Section beginning with the words “in each case if the Merger Date is on or before” in the fourth to last line thereof.

Hedging Event: In respect of any Transaction, the occurrence of any of the following events on or following the first Trading Day of the Forward Hedge Selling Period: (i) (x) a Loss of Stock Borrow in connection with which Counterparty does not refer the Hedging Party to a satisfactory Lending Party within the required time period as provided in Section 12.9(b)(iv) of the Equity Definitions or (y) a Hedging Disruption, (ii) an Increased Cost of Stock Borrow in connection with which Counterparty does not elect, and so notify the Hedging Party of its election within the required time period to either amend such Transaction pursuant to Section 12.9(b)(v)(A) of the Equity Definitions or pay an amount determined by the Calculation Agent that corresponds to the relevant Price Adjustment pursuant to Section 12.9(b)(v)(B) of the Equity Definitions or (iii) a Market Disruption 

12

Event during an Unwind Period for such Transaction and the continuance of such Market Disruption Event for at least eight Scheduled Trading Days. In respect of any Transaction, if a Hedging Event occurs with respect to such Transaction on or after the first Trading Day of the Forward Hedge Selling Period (as each such term is defined in the Equity Distribution Agreement) for such Transaction and prior to the Trade Date for such Transaction, the Calculation Agent may reduce the Initial Forward Price to account for such Hedging Event and any commercially reasonable costs or expenses incurred by Dealer in relation to its commercially reasonable hedge position as a result of such Hedging Event.

Remaining Shares: For any Transaction, on any day, the Number of Shares for such Transaction as of such day (or, if such day occurs during an Unwind Period for such Transaction, the Number of Shares for such Transaction as of such day minus the Unwound Shares for such Transaction for such Unwind Period on such day). 

Unwound Shares: For any Transaction, for any Unwind Period in respect of such Transaction on any day, the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which Dealer has unwound its commercially reasonable hedge position in respect of such Transaction in connection with the related Settlement as of such day.

Transfer: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Dealer may assign, transfer and set over all rights, title and interest, powers, privileges and remedies of Dealer under any Transaction, in whole or in part, to an affiliate of Dealer whose obligation is guaranteed by Dealer or Dealer’s ultimate parent without the consent of Counterparty; provided that (x) no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall have occurred with respect to either party solely as a result of such transfer and assignment and (y) subsequent to such transfer or assignment, Counterparty will neither, as a result of such transfer or assignment, (1) be required to pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement, except to the extent that such additional amounts were payable to the assignor or transferor immediately before the assignment or transfer, nor (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional amount, except to the extent that such additional amounts were not payable by the assignor or transferor immediately before the assignment or transfer. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Master Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing Dealer to purchase, sell, receive or deliver any Shares or other securities to or from Counterparty, Dealer may designate any of its Affiliates to purchase, sell, receive or deliver such Shares or other securities and otherwise to perform Dealer’s obligations in respect of any Transaction hereunder and any such designee may assume such obligations. Dealer shall be discharged of its obligations to Counterparty to the extent of any such performance.

Calculation Agent: Dealer; provided that, following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 5(a)(vii) of the Agreement with respect to which Dealer is the sole Defaulting Party, Counterparty shall have the right to select a leading dealer in

Following any determination or calculation by the Calculation Agent hereunder, upon a written request by Counterparty, the Calculation Agent will, within a commercially reasonable period of time following such request, provide to Counterparty by e-mail to the e-mail address provided by Counterparty in such written request a report (in a commonly used file format for the storage and manipulation of financial data) displaying in reasonable detail the basis for such determination or calculation, as the case may be; provided that Dealer shall not be required to disclose any proprietary or confidential models of Dealer or any information that is proprietary or subject to contractual, legal or regulatory obligations to not disclose such information.

3.Effectiveness. The effectiveness of each Supplemental Confirmation and the related Transaction on the Effective Date for such Supplemental Confirmation shall be subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Dealer) of the following conditions:

(a) the representations and warranties of Counterparty contained in the Equity Distribution Agreement, and any certificate delivered pursuant thereto by Counterparty shall be true and correct or, as provided 

14

in the Equity Distribution Agreement, true and correct in all material respects, on such Effective Date as if made as of such Effective Date;

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Master Confirmation or any Supplemental Confirmation, if in respect of any Transaction (x) on or prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Forward Hedge Settlement Date (as defined in the Equity Distribution Agreement), in connection with establishing its commercially reasonable hedge position in respect of such Transaction, Dealer, in its good faith and commercially reasonable judgment, is unable, after using commercially reasonable efforts, to borrow and deliver for sale the full number of Shares to be borrowed and sold pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement on such Forward Hedge Settlement Date or (y) in Dealer’s good faith and commercially reasonable judgment, it would incur a stock loan cost of more than a rate equal to the Maximum Stock Loan Rate for such Transaction with respect to all or any portion of such full number of Shares, the effectiveness of the related Supplemental Confirmation and such Transaction shall be limited to the number of Shares Dealer is so able to borrow in connection with establishing its commercially reasonable hedge position of such Transaction at a cost of not more than a rate equal to the Maximum Stock Loan Rate for such Transaction, which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be zero.

4.Additional Mutual Representations and Warranties.

5.Additional Representations and Warranties of Counterparty. The representations and warranties of Counterparty set forth in Section 1 of the Equity Distribution Agreement are true and correct as of the date hereof, each date a Placement Notice is effective, each Trade Date for any Transaction and each Forward Hedge Settlement Date (as defined in the Equity Distribution Agreement) and are hereby deemed to be repeated to Dealer as if set forth herein. In addition to the representations and warranties in Section 1 of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Agreement and those contained elsewhere herein, Counterparty represents and warrants to Dealer, and agrees with Dealer, that: 

(a)without limiting the generality of Section 13.1 of the Equity Definitions, it acknowledges that Dealer is not making any representations or warranties with respect to the treatment of any Transaction, including

without limitation ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (or any successor issue statements) or under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Liabilities & Equity Project; 

(b)it shall not take any action to reduce or decrease the number of authorized and unissued Shares below the sum of (i) the aggregate Number of Shares across all Transactions hereunder plus (ii) the total number of Shares issuable upon settlement (whether by net share settlement or otherwise) of any other transaction or agreement to which it is a party; 

(c)it will not repurchase any Shares if, immediately following such repurchase, the aggregate Number of Shares across all Transactions hereunder would be equal to or greater than 9.0% of the number of then-outstanding Shares and it will notify Dealer promptly upon the announcement or consummation of any repurchase of Shares in an amount that, taken together with the amount of all repurchases since the date of the last such notice (or, if no such notice has been given, since the Trade Date), exceeds 0.5% of the number of then-outstanding Shares;

(d)it is not entering into this Master Confirmation or any Supplemental Confirmation to create actual or apparent trading activity in the Shares (or any security convertible into or exchangeable for Shares), or to raise or depress or otherwise manipulate the price of the Shares (or any security convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of the Shares (or any security convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) by others;

(e)it is not aware of any material non-public information regarding itself or the Shares; it is entering into this Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation and will provide any Settlement Notice in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade compliance with Rule 10b-5 or any other provision of the federal securities laws; it has not entered into or altered any hedging transaction relating to the Shares corresponding to or offsetting any Transaction; and it has consulted with its own advisors as to the legal aspects of its adoption and implementation of this Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10b5-1”);

(f)[Reserved];

(g)as of the date hereof, the Trade Date for each Transaction and the date of any payment or delivery by Counterparty or Dealer under any Transaction, it is not and will not be “insolvent” (as such term is defined under Section 101(32) of the Bankruptcy Code);

(h)it is not as of the date hereof, and on the Trade Date for each Transaction and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby and by each Supplemental Confirmation will not be, required to register as an “investment company” as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; 

(i)as of the date hereof and the Trade Date for each Transaction it: (i) is an “institutional account” as defined in FINRA Rule 4512(c); and (ii) is capable of evaluating investment risks independently, both in general and with regard to all transactions and investment strategies involving a security or securities, and will exercise independent judgment in evaluating any recommendations of Dealer or its associated persons; and

6.Additional Covenants of Counterparty. 

16

(a)Counterparty acknowledges and agrees that any Shares delivered by Counterparty to Dealer on any Settlement Date or Net Share Settlement Date for any Transaction will be (i) newly issued, (ii) approved for listing or quotation on the Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, and (iii) registered under the Exchange Act, and, so long as Dealer (or an affiliate of Dealer) has sold the Number of Shares in the manner contemplated by Section 2 of the Equity Distribution Agreement, when delivered by Dealer (or an affiliate of Dealer) to securities lenders from whom Dealer (or an affiliate of Dealer) borrowed Shares in connection with hedging its exposure to such Transaction, will be freely saleable without further registration or other restrictions under the Securities Act in the hands of those securities lenders, irrespective of whether any such stock loan is effected by Dealer or an affiliate of Dealer and, accordingly, Counterparty agrees that any Shares so delivered will not bear a restrictive legend and will be deposited in, and the delivery thereof shall be effected through the facilities of, the Clearance System (this clause (iii), the “Registration Covenant”). In addition, Counterparty represents and agrees that any such Shares shall be, upon such delivery, duly and validly authorized, issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, free of any lien, charge, claim or other encumbrance. 

(b)Counterparty agrees that Counterparty shall not enter into or alter any hedging transaction relating to the Shares corresponding to or offsetting any Transaction. Without limiting the generality of the provisions set forth opposite the caption “Unwind Activities” in Section 2 of this Master Confirmation, Counterparty acknowledges that it has no right to, and agrees that it will not seek to, control or influence Dealer’s decision to make any “purchases or sales” (within the meaning of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B)(3)) under or in connection with any Transaction, including, without limitation, Dealer’s decision to enter into any hedging transactions. 

(c)Counterparty acknowledges and agrees that any amendment, modification, waiver or termination of this Master Confirmation or any Supplemental Confirmation must be effected in accordance with the requirements for the amendment or termination of a “plan” as defined in Rule 10b5-1(c). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any such amendment, modification, waiver or termination shall be made in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5, and no such amendment, modification or waiver shall be made at any time at which Counterparty or any officer, director, manager or similar person of Counterparty is aware of any material non-public information regarding Counterparty or the Shares.

(d)Counterparty shall provide notice thereof to Dealer (i) of the occurrence of any event that would constitute an Event of Default in respect of which Counterparty is a Defaulting Party by the next succeeding Exchange Business Day following such occurrence, and (ii) of the announcement of any event that, to the knowledge of Counterparty if consummated, would constitute an Extraordinary Event or Potential Adjustment Event by the fifth succeeding Exchange Business Day following such announcement.

(e)Neither Counterparty nor any of its “affiliated purchasers” (as defined by Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10b-18”)) shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to cause any purchases of Shares by Dealer or any of its Affiliates in connection with any Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement of any Transaction not to meet the requirements of the safe harbor provided by Rule 10b-18 if such purchases were made by Counterparty. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during any Unwind Period for any Transaction, except with the prior written consent of Dealer, Counterparty will not, and will cause its affiliated purchasers (as defined in Rule 10b-18) not to, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, by means of a derivative instrument) purchase, offer to purchase, place any bid or limit order that would effect a purchase of, or announce or commence any tender offer relating to, any Shares (or equivalent interest, including a unit of beneficial interest in a trust or limited partnership or a depository share) or any security convertible into or exchangeable for the Shares. However, the foregoing shall not (i) limit Counterparty’s ability, pursuant to any issuer “plan” (as defined in Rule 10b-18), to re-acquire Shares from employees in connection with such plan or program, (ii) limit Counterparty’s ability to withhold Shares to cover tax liabilities associated with such a plan, (iii) prohibit any purchases effected by or for an issuer “plan” by an “agent independent of the issuer” (each as defined in Rule 10b-18), (iv) otherwise restrict Counterparty’s or any of its affiliates’ ability to repurchase Shares under privately negotiated, off-exchange transactions with any of its employees, officers, directors, affiliates or any third party that, in each case, will not result in any market transactions or (v) limit Counterparty’s ability to grant stock and options to “affiliated purchasers” (as defined in Rule 10b-18) or the ability of such affiliated purchasers to acquire such stock or options in connection with any issuer “plan” (as defined in Rule 10b-18) for directors, officers and employees or any 

17

agreements with respect to any such plan for directors, officers or employees of any entities that are acquisition targets of Counterparty, in the case of each of clauses (i) through (v), to the extent that such transaction or event does not constitute a “Rule 10b-18 purchase” (as defined in Rule 10b-18).

(f)Counterparty will not be subject to any “restricted period” (as such term is defined in Regulation M promulgated under the Exchange Act (“Regulation M”)) in respect of Shares or any security with respect to which the Shares are a “reference security” (as such term is defined in Regulation M) during any Unwind Period for any Transaction.

(g)Counterparty shall: (i) prior to the opening of trading in the Shares on any day on which Counterparty makes, or expects to be made, any public announcement (as defined in Rule 165(f) under the Securities Act) of any Merger Transaction, notify Dealer of such public announcement; (ii) promptly notify Dealer following any such announcement that such announcement has been made; (iii) promptly (but in any event prior to the next opening of the regular trading session on the Exchange) provide Dealer with written notice specifying (A) Counterparty’s average daily Rule 10b-18 purchases (as defined in Rule 10b-18) during the three full calendar months immediately preceding the announcement date for the Merger Transaction that were not effected through Dealer or its affiliates and (B) the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the proviso in Rule 10b-18(b)(4) under the Exchange Act for the three full calendar months preceding such announcement date. Such written notice shall be deemed to be a certification by Counterparty to Dealer that such information is true and correct. In addition, Counterparty shall promptly notify Dealer of the earlier to occur of the completion of such transaction and the completion of the vote by target shareholders. Counterparty acknowledges that any such notice may result in a Regulatory Disruption, a Trading Condition or, if such notice relates to an event that is also an ISDA Event, an Early Valuation, or may affect the length of any ongoing Unwind Period; accordingly, Counterparty acknowledges that its delivery of such notice must comply with the standards set forth in Section 6(c) above. “Merger Transaction” means any merger, acquisition or similar transaction involving a recapitalization as contemplated by Rule 10b-18(a)(13)(iv) under the Exchange Act. For the avoidance of doubt, a Merger Transaction or the announcement thereof shall not give either party the right to designate an Early Valuation Date for any Transaction and/or to accelerate or preclude an election by Counterparty of Physical Settlement for any Settlement of any Transaction, unless such Merger Transaction or the announcement thereof is also an ISDA Event. 

(h)Counterparty will promptly execute each properly completed Supplemental Confirmation delivered to Counterparty by Dealer following the delivery by Counterparty to Dealer of a Placement Notice relating to a Forward (as such term is defined in the Equity Distribution Agreement). 

7.Termination on Bankruptcy. The parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or the Equity Definitions, each Transaction constitutes a contract to issue a security of Counterparty as contemplated by Section 365(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code and that a Transaction and the obligations and rights of Counterparty and Dealer (except for any liability as a result of breach of any of the representations or warranties provided by Counterparty in Section 4 or Section 5 above) shall immediately terminate, without the necessity of any notice, payment (whether directly, by netting or otherwise) or other action by Counterparty or Dealer, if, on or prior to the final Settlement Method Election Date, or if later, the final Cash Settlement Payment Date or the final Net Share Settlement Date, as the case may be, for such Transaction an Insolvency Filing occurs or any other proceeding commences with respect to Counterparty under the Bankruptcy Code (a “Bankruptcy Termination Event”). 

8.Additional Provisions. 

(a)Dealer acknowledges and agrees that Counterparty’s obligations under the Transactions are not secured by any collateral and that neither this Master Confirmation nor any Supplemental Confirmation is intended to convey to Dealer rights with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and by any Supplemental Confirmation that are senior to the claims of common stockholders in any U.S. bankruptcy proceedings of Counterparty; provided that nothing herein shall limit or shall be deemed to limit Dealer’s right to pursue remedies in the event of a breach by Counterparty of its obligations and agreements with respect to this Master Confirmation, any Supplemental Confirmation or the Agreement; provided further that nothing herein shall limit or shall be deemed to limit Dealer’s rights in respect of any transaction other than the Transactions.

18

(b)[Reserved];

(c)The parties hereto intend for:

(i) each Transaction to be a “securities contract” as defined in Section 741(7) of the Bankruptcy Code, and the parties hereto to be entitled to the protections afforded by, among other Sections, Sections 362(b)(6), 362(b)(27), 362(o), 546(e), 546(j), 555 and 561 of the Bankruptcy Code;

(ii) the rights given to Dealer pursuant to “Early Valuation” in Section 2 above to constitute “contractual rights” to cause the liquidation of a “securities contract” and to set off mutual debts and claims in connection with a “securities contract”, as such terms are used in Sections 555 and 362(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code;

(iii) any cash, securities or other property provided as performance assurance, credit support or collateral with respect to the Transactions to constitute “margin payments” and “transfers” under a “securities contract” as defined in the Bankruptcy Code;

(iv) all payments for, under or in connection with the Transactions, all payments for Shares and the transfer of Shares to constitute “settlement payments” and “transfers” under a “securities contract” as defined in the Bankruptcy Code; and

(v) any or all obligations that either party has with respect to this Master Confirmation, any Supplemental Confirmation or the Agreement to constitute property held by or due from such party to margin, guaranty or settle obligations of the other party with respect to the transactions under the Agreement (including the Transactions) or any other agreement between such parties.

(d)Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, this Master Confirmation or any Supplemental Confirmation, in no event will Counterparty be required to deliver in the aggregate in respect of all Settlement Dates, Net Share Settlement Dates or other dates on which Shares are delivered in respect of any amount owed under any Transaction a number of Shares greater than 1.5 times the Number of Shares for such Transaction as of the Trade Date for such Transaction (the “Capped Number”). The Capped Number shall be subject to adjustment only on account of (x) Potential Adjustment Events of the type specified in (1) Sections 11.2(e)(i) through (vi) of the Equity Definitions or (2) Section 11.2(e)(vii) of the Equity Definitions so long as, in the case of this sub-clause (2), such event is within Issuer’s control and (y) Merger Events requiring corporate action of Issuer (or any surviving entity of the Issuer hereunder in connection with any such Merger Event). Counterparty represents and warrants to Dealer (which representation and warranty shall be deemed to be repeated for all Transactions on each day that any Transaction is outstanding) that the aggregate Capped Number across all Transactions hereunder is equal to or less than the number of authorized but unissued Shares that are not reserved for future issuance in connection with transactions in the Shares (other than the Transactions) on the date of the determination of such aggregated Capped Number. In the event Counterparty shall not have delivered the full number of Shares otherwise deliverable under any Transaction as a result of this Section 8(d) (the resulting deficit for such Transaction, the “Deficit Shares”), Counterparty shall be continually obligated to deliver Shares, from time to time until the full number of Deficit Shares have been delivered pursuant to this paragraph, on a pro rata basis across all Transactions hereunder, when, and to the extent that, (A) Shares are repurchased, acquired or otherwise received by Counterparty or any of its subsidiaries after the date hereof (whether or not in exchange for cash, fair value or any other consideration), (B) authorized and unissued Shares reserved for issuance in respect of other transactions prior to such date which prior to the relevant date become no longer so reserved or (C) Counterparty additionally authorizes any unissued Shares that are not reserved for transactions other than the Transactions (such events as set forth in clauses (A), (B) and (C) above, collectively, the “Share Issuance Events”). Counterparty shall promptly notify Dealer of the occurrence of any of the Share Issuance Events (including the number of Shares subject to clause (A), (B) or (C) and the corresponding number of Shares to be delivered for each Transaction) and, as promptly as reasonably practicable, deliver such Shares thereafter. Counterparty shall not, until Counterparty’s obligations under the Transactions have been satisfied in full, use any Shares that become available for potential delivery to Dealer as a result of any Share Issuance Event for the settlement or satisfaction of any transaction or obligation other than the Transactions and any other transaction under a confirmation entered into by Counterparty and another dealer pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement by and between Counterparty and the other parties thereto (each, an “Other Dealer’s Transaction”), or reserve any such Shares for future issuance for any purpose other than to satisfy 

19

Counterparty’s obligations to Dealer under the Transactions or any Other Dealer’s Transaction. Allocation of any Shares that become available for potential delivery to Dealer or any dealer party to an Other Dealer’s Transaction as a result of any Share Issuance Event shall be allocated to the Transactions and any Other Dealer’s Transaction(s) on a ratable basis in accordance with the respective remaining Share delivery obligations thereunder.

(e)The parties intend for this Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation to constitute a “Contract” as described in the letter dated October 6, 2003 submitted on behalf of Goldman, Sachs & Co. to Paula Dubberly of the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Staff”) to which the Staff responded in an interpretive letter dated October 9, 2003.

(f)The parties intend for each Transaction (taking into account purchases of Shares in connection with any Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement of any Transaction) to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(A) under the Exchange Act and for this Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation to constitute a binding contract or instruction satisfying the requirements of 10b5-1(c) and to be interpreted to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c).

(g)[Reserved.]

(h)Counterparty acknowledges that:

(i)during the term of the Transactions, Dealer and its affiliates may buy or sell Shares or other securities or buy or sell options or futures contracts or enter into swaps or other derivative securities in order to establish, adjust or unwind its commercially reasonable hedge position with respect to the Transactions;

(ii)Dealer and its affiliates may also be active in the market for the Shares and derivatives linked to the Shares other than in connection with commercially reasonable hedging activities in relation to the Transactions, including acting as agent or as principal and for its own account or on behalf of customers;

(iii)Dealer shall make its own determination as to whether, when or in what manner any hedging or market activities in Counterparty’s securities shall be conducted and shall do so in a manner that it deems appropriate in its commercially reasonable discretion to hedge its price and market risk with respect to the Forward Price and the Settlement Price for each Transaction;

(iv)any market activities of Dealer and its affiliates with respect to the Shares may affect the market price and volatility of the Shares, as well as the Forward Price and the Settlement Price for each Transaction, each in a manner that may be adverse to Counterparty; and

(v)each Transaction is a derivatives transaction; Dealer may purchase or sell shares for its own account at an average price that may be greater than, or less than, the price received by Counterparty under the terms of the relevant Transaction.

(i)Counterparty and Dealer agree and acknowledge that (A) the Transactions contemplated by this Master Confirmation will be entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation hereto form a single agreement between Counterparty and Dealer, and Dealer would not otherwise enter into such Transactions; (B) this Master Confirmation, together with each Supplemental Confirmation hereto, is a “qualified financial contract,” as such term is defined in Section 5-701(b)(2) of the General Obligations Law; (C) each Supplemental Confirmation hereto, regardless of whether transmitted electronically or otherwise, constitutes a “confirmation in writing sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made between the parties” hereto, as set forth in Section 5-701(b)(3)(b) of the General Obligations Law; and (D) this Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation hereto constitute a prior “written contract,” as set forth in Section 5-701(b)(1)(b) of the General Obligations Law, and each party hereto intends and agrees to be bound by this Master Confirmation and such Supplemental Confirmation.

20

(j)Counterparty and Dealer agree that, upon the effectiveness of any Accepted Placement Notice relating to a Forward, in respect of the Transaction to which such Accepted Placement Notice relates, each of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and other provisions of this Master Confirmation and the Supplemental Confirmation for such Transaction (including, without limitation, Dealer’s right to designate an Early Valuation Date in respect of such Transaction pursuant to the provisions opposite the caption “Early Valuation” in Section 2 and the termination of such Transaction following a Bankruptcy Termination Event as described in Section 7) shall govern, and be applicable to, such Transaction as of the first Trading Day of the Forward Hedge Selling Period for such Transaction as if the Trade Date for such Transaction were such first Trading Day.

(k)Tax Matters.

(i)Payer Tax Representations. For the purpose of Section 3(e) of the Agreement, each of Dealer and Counterparty makes the following representation: It is not required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, of any Relevant Jurisdiction to make any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax from any payment (other than interest under Section 9(h) of the Agreement or amounts payable hereunder that may be considered to be interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes) to be made by it to the other party under the Agreement. In making this representation, it may rely on (i) the accuracy of any representations made by the other party pursuant to Section 3(f) of the Agreement, (ii) the satisfaction of the agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i) or Section 4(a)(iii) of the Agreement and the accuracy and effectiveness of any document provided by the other party pursuant to Section 4(a)(i) or Section 4(a)(iii) of the Agreement and (iii) the satisfaction of the agreement of the other party contained in Section 4(d) of the Agreement, except that it will not be a breach of this representation where reliance is placed on clause (ii) above and the other party does not deliver a form or document under Section 4(a)(iii) of the Agreement by reason of material prejudice to its legal or commercial position.

(ii)Payee Tax Representations. For the purpose of Section 3(f) of the Agreement, Dealer and Counterparty make the following representations.

The following representations will apply to Dealer: 

a.It is a “U.S. person” (as that term is used in Section 7701(a)(30) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and Section 1.1441-4(a)(3)(ii) of the United States Treasury Regulations) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

b.It is a national banking association organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America and is an exempt recipient under Treasury Regulation Section 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii).

The following representations will apply to Counterparty:

a.Counterparty is a corporation established under the laws of the State of Delaware.

b.Counterparty is a “U.S. person” (as that term is used in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), and Section 1.1441-4(a)(3)(ii) of the United States Treasury Regulations) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and a corporation that is an exempt recipient under Section 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(A) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

(iii)Agreements to Deliver Documents. For the purpose of Section 4(a)(i) and Section 4(a)(ii) of the Agreement, Dealer and Counterparty each agrees to deliver, as applicable, (i) in the case of Dealer, a completed and accurate U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W9 (or successor thereto), (ii) in 

21

the case of Counterparty, a complete and accurate U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W9 (or successor thereto) and (iii) in the case of Dealer and Counterparty, any other form or document that may be required by the other party in order to allow such party to make a payment under this Master Confirmation, including any Credit Support Document, without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate. In each case, such form or document shall be completed in a manner reasonably acceptable to the other party and shall be delivered (x) in the case of (i) and (ii) above, promptly upon execution of this Master Confirmation, (y) promptly upon reasonable demand by the other party and (z) promptly upon learning that any form previously provided has become inaccurate, obsolete or incorrect. Additionally, Counterparty shall promptly upon request by Dealer, provide such other tax forms and documents requested by Dealer. 

(iv)“Tax” as used in this clause (k) and “Indemnifiable Tax” as defined in Section 14 of the Agreement shall not include (A) any tax imposed or collected pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code (a “FATCA Withholding Tax”) and (B) any tax imposed or collected pursuant to Section 871(m) of the Code or any current or future regulations or official interpretation thereof (a “Section 871(m) Withholding Tax”). For the avoidance of doubt, each of a FATCA Withholding Tax and a Section 871(m) Withholding Tax is a Tax the deduction or withholding of which is required by applicable law for purposes of Section 2(d) of the Agreement. 

9.Indemnification. Counterparty agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Dealer, its affiliates and its assignees and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons (Dealer and each such person being an “Indemnified Party”) from and against any and all losses (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, financial losses resulting from the economic terms of the Transactions), claims, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), joint or several, incurred by or asserted against such Indemnified Party arising out of, in connection with, or relating to, any breach of any covenant or representation made by Counterparty in this Master Confirmation, any Supplemental Confirmation or the Agreement but only to the extent that the relevant loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is found in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such breach. Counterparty will not be liable under the foregoing indemnification provision to the extent that any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is found in a nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from Dealer’s willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith in performing the services that are subject of the Transactions. If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to any Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold harmless any Indemnified Party, then Counterparty shall contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to the amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability. In addition, Counterparty will reimburse any Indemnified Party for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) as they are incurred in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense or settlement of any pending or threatened claim or any action, suit or proceeding arising therefrom, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party thereto and whether or not such claim, action, suit or proceeding is initiated or brought by or on behalf of Counterparty. Counterparty also agrees that no Indemnified Party shall have any liability to Counterparty or any person asserting claims on behalf of or in right of Counterparty in connection with or as a result of any matter referred to in this Master Confirmation and any Supplemental Confirmation except to the extent that any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses incurred by Counterparty result from the breach of any covenant or representation made by Dealer in this Master Confirmation or any Supplemental Confirmation or the Agreement or any negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or bad faith of the Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive the completion of the Transactions contemplated by this Master Confirmation and any Supplemental Confirmation and any assignment and/or delegation of the Transactions made pursuant to the Agreement, this Master Confirmation or any Supplemental Confirmation shall inure to the benefit of any permitted assignee of Dealer. For the avoidance of doubt, any payments due as a result of this provision may not be used to set off any obligation of Dealer upon settlement of the Transactions. 

10.Beneficial Ownership. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, this Master Confirmation or any Supplemental Confirmation, in no event shall Dealer be entitled to receive, or be deemed to 

22

receive, or have the “right to acquire” (within the meaning of NYSE Rule 312.04(g)) Shares to the extent that, upon such receipt of such Shares, (i) the “beneficial ownership” (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) of Shares by Dealer, any of its affiliates’ business units subject to aggregation with Dealer for purposes of the “beneficial ownership” test under Section 13 of the Exchange Act and all persons who may form a “group” (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act), or deemed to form a “group” (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act), with Dealer with respect to “beneficial ownership” of any Shares (collectively, “Dealer Group”) would be equal to or greater than the lesser of (x) 9.0% of the outstanding Shares (such condition, an “Excess Section 13 Ownership Position”), and (y) 4.9% of the outstanding Shares as of the Trade Date for any Transaction, which shall be notified by Counterparty to Dealer on the Trade Date and set forth in the Supplemental Confirmation (such number of Shares, the “Threshold Number of Shares” and such condition, the “Excess NYSE Ownership Position”) or (ii) Dealer, Dealer Group or any person whose ownership position would be aggregated with that of Dealer or Dealer Group (Dealer, Dealer Group or any such person, a “Dealer Person”) under the Delaware General Corporation Law or any state or federal bank holding company or banking laws, or any federal, state or local laws, regulations or regulatory orders applicable to ownership of Shares (“Applicable Laws”), would own, beneficially own, constructively own, control, hold the power to vote or otherwise meet a relevant definition of ownership in excess of a number of Shares equal to (x) the lesser of (A) the maximum number of Shares that would be permitted under Applicable Laws and (B) the number of Shares that would give rise to reporting or registration obligations (other than any filing under Section 13 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, in each case, as in effect on the Trade Date) or other requirements (including obtaining prior approval by a state or federal regulator) of a Dealer Person under Applicable Laws and with respect to which such requirements have not been met or the relevant approval has not been received or that would give rise to any consequences under the constitutive documents of Counterparty or any contract or agreement to which Counterparty is a party, in each case minus (y) 1% of the number of Shares outstanding on the date of determination (such number of Shares described in clause (ii), the “Threshold Regulatory Number of Shares” and such condition described in clause (ii), an “Excess Regulatory Ownership Position”). The Threshold Regulatory Number of Shares shall be notified by Counterparty to Dealer on the Trade Date and set forth in the Supplemental Confirmation. If any delivery owed to Dealer under any Transaction is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this provision, (i) Counterparty’s obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and Counterparty shall make such delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one Exchange Business Day after, Dealer gives notice to Counterparty that such delivery would not result in (x) Dealer Group directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of the lesser of (A) 9.0% of the outstanding Shares and (B) the Threshold Number of Shares or (y) the occurrence of an Excess Regulatory Ownership Position and (ii) if such delivery relates to a Physical Settlement of any Transaction, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Dealer shall not be obligated to satisfy the portion of its payment obligation with respect to such Transaction corresponding to any Shares required to be so delivered until the date Counterparty makes such delivery.

11.Non-Confidentiality. The parties hereby agree that (i) effective from the date of commencement of discussions concerning the Transactions, Counterparty and each of its employees, representatives, or other agents may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Transactions and all materials of any kind, including opinions or other tax analyses, provided by Dealer and its affiliates to Counterparty relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that the foregoing does not constitute an authorization to disclose the identity of Dealer or its affiliates, agents or advisers, or, except to the extent relating to such tax structure or tax treatment, any specific pricing terms or commercial or financial information, and (ii) Dealer does not assert any claim of proprietary ownership in respect of any description contained herein or therein relating to the use of any entities, plans or arrangements to give rise to a particular United States federal income tax treatment for Counterparty. 

12.Restricted Shares. If Counterparty is unable to comply with the Registration Covenant of Counterparty contained in Section 6(a)(iii) above or Dealer otherwise determines in its reasonable opinion that any Shares to be delivered to Dealer by Counterparty under any Transaction may not be freely returned by Dealer to securities lenders as described in the Registration Covenant of Counterparty contained in Section 6(a)(iii) above, then delivery of any such Settlement Shares (the “Unregistered Settlement Shares”) shall be effected pursuant to Annex A hereto, unless waived by Dealer. 

23

13.Use of Shares. Dealer acknowledges and agrees that, except in the case of a Private Placement Settlement, Dealer shall use any Shares delivered by Counterparty to Dealer on any Settlement Date to return to securities lenders to close out borrowings created by Dealer (or an affiliate thereof) in connection with its hedging activities related to exposure under the Transactions or otherwise in compliance with applicable law.

14.Rule 10b-18. In connection with bids and purchases of Shares in connection with any Net Share Settlement or Cash Settlement of any Transaction (taking into account any settlement of any other substantially similar issuer forward or similar transactions with Dealer), Dealer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its activities, or cause its affiliates to conduct their activities, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the safe harbor provided by Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, as if such provisions were applicable to such purchases and taking into account any applicable Securities and Exchange Commission no-action letters as appropriate, and subject to any delays between the execution and reporting of a trade of the Shares on the Exchange and other circumstances beyond Dealer’s control. 

15.Governing Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the Agreement, this Master Confirmation, any Supplemental Confirmation and all matters arising in connection with the Agreement this Master Confirmation and any Supplemental Confirmation shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York (without reference to its choice of laws doctrine other than Title 14 of Article 5 of the New York General Obligations Law). 

16.Set-Off. Each party waives any and all rights it may have to set-off delivery or payment obligations it owes to the other party under any Transaction against any delivery or payment obligations owed to it by the other party, whether arising under the Agreement, under any other agreement between parties hereto, by operation of law or otherwise.

17.Staggered Settlement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Dealer may, by prior notice to Counterparty, satisfy its obligation to deliver any Shares or other securities on any date due (an “Original Delivery Date”) by making separate deliveries of Shares or such securities, as the case may be, at more than one time on or prior to such Original Delivery Date, so long as the aggregate number of Shares and other securities so delivered on or prior to such Original Delivery Date is equal to the number required to be delivered on such Original Delivery Date.

18.Waiver of Trial by Jury. EACH OF COUNTERPARTY AND DEALER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES (ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ON BEHALF OF ITS STOCKHOLDERS) ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TRANSACTION OR THE ACTIONS OF DEALER OR ITS AFFILIATES IN THE NEGOTIATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. 

19.Jurisdiction. The parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with all matters relating hereto and waive any objection to the laying of venue in, and any claim of inconvenient forum with respect to, these courts. Nothing in this provision shall prohibit a party from bringing an action to enforce a money judgment in any other jurisdiction.

20.Counterparts. This Master Confirmation and each Supplemental Confirmation may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument, and any party hereto may execute this Master Confirmation by signing and delivering one or more counterparts. The words “execution,” signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in the Agreement or this Master Confirmation or in any other certificate, agreement or document related to the Agreement or this Master Confirmation, if any, shall include images of manually executed signatures transmitted by facsimile or other electronic format (including, without limitation, “pdf”, “tif” or “jpg”) and other electronic signatures (including, without limitation, DocuSign and AdobeSign). The use of electronic signatures and electronic records (including, without limitation, any contract or other record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means) shall be of the same legal effect, 

24

validity and enforceability as a manually executed signature or use of a paper-based record-keeping system to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act and any other applicable law, including, without limitation, any state law based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act or the Uniform Commercial Code. 

21.Delivery of Cash. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Master Confirmation or any Supplemental Confirmation shall be interpreted as requiring Counterparty to deliver cash or other assets in respect of the settlement of the Transactions, except in circumstances where the required cash or other asset settlement thereof is permitted for classification of the contract as equity by ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, as in effect on the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not be construed as limiting Section 9 hereunder or any damages that may be payable by Counterparty as a result of a breach of this Master Confirmation or any Supplemental Confirmation. 

22.Adjustments. For the avoidance of doubt, whenever the Calculation Agent, the Hedging Party or the Determining Party is called upon to make an adjustment pursuant to the terms of this Master Confirmation, any Supplemental Confirmation or the Equity Definitions to take into account the effect of an event, the Calculation Agent, the Hedging Party or the Determining Party, as applicable, shall make such adjustment by reference to the effect of such event on the Hedging Party, assuming that the Hedging Party maintains a commercially reasonable hedge position at the time of the event.

23.Other Forward Transactions. Dealer acknowledges that Counterparty has entered or may enter in the future into one or more substantially similar forward transactions for the Shares (each, an “Other Forward” and collectively, the “Other Forwards”) with one or more dealers (each, an “Other Dealer” and collectively, the “Other Dealers”). Dealer and Counterparty agree that if Counterparty designates a “Settlement Date” with respect to one or more Other Forwards for which “Cash Settlement” or “Net Share Settlement” is applicable, and the resulting “Unwind Period” for any such Other Forward coincides for any period of time with an Unwind Period for the Transaction (the “Overlap Unwind Period”), Counterparty shall notify Dealer at least three Scheduled Trading Day prior to the commencement of such Overlap Unwind Period of the first Scheduled Trading Day and length of such Overlap Unwind Period, and Dealer shall be permitted to purchase Shares to unwind its hedge in respect of the Transaction only on alternating Scheduled Trading Days during such Overlap Unwind Period, commencing on the first, second, third or later Scheduled Trading Day of such Overlap Unwind Period, as notified to Dealer by Counterparty at least one Scheduled Trading Day prior to such Overlap Unwind Period (which alternating Scheduled Trading Days, for the avoidance of doubt, may be every other Scheduled Trading Day if there is only one Other Dealer, every third Scheduled Trading Day if there are two Other Dealers, etc.).

24.U.S. Resolution Stay. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) to the extent that prior to the date hereof both parties have adhered to the 2018 ISDA U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (the “Protocol”), the terms of the Protocol are incorporated into and form a part of the Agreement, and for such purposes the Agreement shall be deemed a Protocol Covered Agreement, Dealer shall be deemed a Regulated Entity and Counterparty shall be deemed an Adhering Party; (ii) to the extent that prior to the date hereof the parties have executed a separate agreement the effect of which is to amend the qualified financial contracts between them to conform with the requirements of the QFC Stay Rules (the “Bilateral Agreement”), the terms of the Bilateral Agreement are incorporated into and form a part of the Agreement, and for such purposes the Agreement shall be deemed a Covered Agreement, Dealer shall be deemed a Covered Entity and Counterparty shall be deemed a Counterparty Entity; or (iii) if clause (i) and clause (ii) do not apply, the terms of Section 1 and Section 2 and the related defined terms (together, the “Bilateral Terms”) of the form of bilateral template entitled “Full-Length Omnibus (for use between U.S. G-SIBs and Corporate Groups)” published by ISDA on November 2, 2018 (currently available on the 2018 ISDA U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol page at www.isda.org and, a copy of which is available upon request), the effect of which is to amend the qualified financial contracts between the parties thereto to conform with the requirements of the QFC Stay Rules, are hereby incorporated into and form a part of the Agreement, and for such purposes the Agreement shall be deemed a “Covered Agreement,” Dealer shall be deemed a “Covered Entity” and Counterparty shall be deemed a “Counterparty Entity.” In the event that, after the date of the Agreement, both parties hereto become adhering parties to the Protocol, the terms of the Protocol will replace the terms of this 

25

paragraph. In the event of any inconsistencies between the Agreement and the terms of the Protocol, the Bilateral Agreement or the Bilateral Terms (each, the “QFC Stay Terms”), as applicable, the QFC Stay Terms will govern. Terms used in this paragraph without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them under the QFC Stay Rules. For purposes of this paragraph, references to “the Agreement” include any related credit enhancements entered into between the parties or provided by one to the other. In addition, the parties agree that the terms of this paragraph shall be incorporated into any related covered affiliate credit enhancements, with all references to Dealer replaced by references to the covered affiliate support provider. “QFC Stay Rules” means the regulations codified at 12 C.F.R. 252.2, 252.81–8, 12 C.F.R. 382.1-7 and 12 C.F.R. 47.1-8, which, subject to limited exceptions, require an express recognition of the stay-and-transfer powers of the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Orderly Liquidation Authority under Title II of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the override of default rights related directly or indirectly to the entry of an affiliate into certain insolvency proceedings and any restrictions on the transfer of any covered affiliate credit enhancements.

26

Counterparty hereby agrees (a) to check this Master Confirmation carefully and promptly upon receipt so that errors or discrepancies can be promptly identified and rectified and (b) to confirm that the foregoing (in the exact form provided by Dealer) correctly sets forth the terms of the agreement between Dealer and Counterparty hereunder, by manually signing this Master Confirmation or this page hereof as evidence of agreement to such terms and providing the other information requested herein and promptly returning an executed copy to us.

ANNEX A

PRIVATE PLACEMENT PROCEDURES

If Counterparty delivers Unregistered Settlement Shares pursuant to Section 12 above (a “Private Placement Settlement”), then:

(a)all Unregistered Settlement Shares shall be delivered to Dealer (or any affiliate of Dealer designated by Dealer) pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) thereof;

(b)as of or prior to the date of delivery, Dealer and any potential purchaser of any such shares from Dealer (or any affiliate of Dealer designated by Dealer) identified by Dealer shall be afforded a commercially reasonable opportunity to conduct a due diligence investigation with respect to Counterparty customary in scope for private placements of equity securities of similar size (including, without limitation, the right to have made available to them for inspection all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and other information reasonably requested by them); provided that prior to receiving or being granted access to any such information, Dealer, such affiliate of Dealer or such potential purchaser, as the case may be, may be required by Counterparty to enter into a customary nondisclosure agreement with Counterparty in respect of any such due diligence investigation;

(c)as of the date of delivery, Counterparty shall enter into an agreement (a “Private Placement Agreement”) with Dealer (or any affiliate of Dealer designated by Dealer) in connection with the private placement of such shares by Counterparty to Dealer (or any such affiliate) and the private resale of such shares by Dealer (or any such affiliate), substantially similar to private placement purchase agreements customary for private placements of equity securities of similar size, in form and substance commercially reasonably satisfactory to Dealer, which Private Placement Agreement shall include, without limitation, provisions substantially similar to those contained in such private placement purchase agreements relating, without limitation, to the indemnification of, and contribution in connection with the liability of, Dealer and its affiliates and obligations to use best efforts to obtain customary opinions, accountants’ comfort letters and lawyers’ negative assurance letters, and shall provide for the payment by Counterparty of all commercially reasonable fees and expenses in connection with such resale, including all commercially reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for Dealer, and shall contain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Counterparty reasonably necessary or advisable to establish and maintain the availability of an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for such resales; and

(d)in connection with the private placement of such shares by Counterparty to Dealer (or any such affiliate) and the private resale of such shares by Dealer (or any such affiliate), Counterparty shall, if so requested by Dealer, prepare, in cooperation with Dealer, a private placement memorandum in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Dealer.

In the case of a Private Placement Settlement, Dealer shall, in its good faith discretion, adjust the amount of Unregistered Settlement Shares to be delivered to Dealer hereunder in a commercially reasonable manner to reflect the fact that such Unregistered Settlement Shares may not be freely returned to securities lenders by Dealer and may only be saleable by Dealer at a discount to reflect the lack of liquidity in Unregistered Settlement Shares.

If Counterparty delivers any Unregistered Settlement Shares in respect of a Transaction, Counterparty agrees that (i) such Shares may be transferred by and among Dealer and its affiliates and (ii) after the applicable “holding period” within the meaning of Rule 144(d) under the Securities Act has elapsed after the applicable Settlement Date, Counterparty shall promptly remove, or cause the transfer agent for the Shares to remove, any legends referring to any transfer restrictions from such Shares upon delivery by Dealer (or such affiliate of Dealer) to Counterparty or such transfer agent of any seller’s and broker’s representation letters customarily delivered by Dealer or its affiliates in connection with resales of restricted securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, each without any further requirement for the delivery of any certificate, consent, agreement, opinion of counsel, 

notice or any other document, any transfer tax stamps or payment of any other amount or any other action by Dealer (or such affiliate of Dealer).
