We also significantly increased brand investments and improved our market share positions. In addition, we achieved $575 million of cost savings and returned $2.15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we grew adjusted earnings per share 12 percent, well above our medium-term objective. I’m extremely proud of what our teams accomplished while staying relentlessly focused on employee health and safety and meeting the needs of our consumers during this unprecedented time period.”

Hsu continued, “Going forward we will continue to execute K-C Strategy 2022. We expect to further improve our market positions by building on our current momentum and leveraging our enhanced commercial capabilities. At the

That said, we remain very optimistic about our strategies to deliver balanced and sustainable growth over time and create long-term shareholder value.”

Fourth Quarter 2020 Operating Results

Sales of $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 6 percent compared to the year-ago period. Organic sales rose 5 percent and the Softex Indonesia acquisition increased sales by approximately 2 percent, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales 1 percent. Net selling prices increased approximately 3 percent, volumes increased 2 percent and product mix was slightly favorable. In North America, organic sales increased 11 percent in consumer products but fell 7 percent in K-C Professional. Outside North America, organic sales rose 3 percent in developing and emerging (D&E) markets and 2 percent in developed markets.

Fourth quarter operating profit was $749 million in 2020 and $751 million in 2019. Results in both periods include charges related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program. Results in 2020 also include Softex Indonesia acquisition-related costs and a benefit from the resolution of a business tax matter in Brazil. Results in 2019 also include a gain on the sale of property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed as part of a past restructuring.

Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit was $767 million in 2020 and $826 million in 2019. Results benefited from organic sales growth, $110 million of cost savings from the company’s FORCE (Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere) program and $25 million of cost savings from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program. Input costs increased $40 million and other manufacturing costs were higher, including costs related to COVID-19. Advertising spending increased significantly and general and administrative costs were higher, including incentive compensation expense and capability-building investments. Foreign currency transaction effects also negatively impacted the comparison.

The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 24.6 percent in 2020 and 17.2 percent in 2019. The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.2 percent in 2020 and 24.6 percent in 2019. The rate in 2020 benefited from certain planning initiatives.

Kimberly-Clark’s share of net income of equity companies in the fourth quarter was $38 million in 2020 and $32 million in 2019. Results benefited from organic sales growth but were negatively impacted by unfavorable currency effects.

Cash Flow and Balance Sheet

Cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter was $887 million in 2020 and $924 million in 2019. Full-year cash provided by operations was an all-time record $3,729 million in 2020 compared to $2,736 million in 2019. The increase was driven by improved working capital and higher earnings. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $323 million in 2020 and $342 million in 2019. Full-year spending was $1,217 million in 2020 and $1,209 million in 2019.

Fourth quarter 2020 share repurchases were 1.7 million shares at a cost of $243 million, bringing full-year repurchases to 4.9 million shares at a cost of $700 million. Total debt was $8.4 billion at the end of 2020 and $7.7 billion at the end of 2019. The increase included incremental financing to fund the Softex Indonesia acquisition that closed on October 1, 2020.

The increase was driven by growth in adjusted operating profit, along with higher net income from equity companies and declines in the share count and adjusted effective tax rate.

2018 Global Restructuring Program

In January 2018, Kimberly-Clark initiated the 2018 Global Restructuring Program in order to reduce the company’s structural cost base and enhance the company’s flexibility to invest in its brands, growth initiatives and capabilities critical to delivering future growth. As part of the program, Kimberly-Clark expects to exit or divest some low-margin businesses that generate about 1 percent of company net sales.

The restructuring is expected to be completed in 2021. Total restructuring charges are anticipated to be $2,000 to $2,100 million pre-tax ($1,490 to $1,570 million after tax) compared to the previous estimate for charges toward the high end of the range of $1,700 to $1,900 million pre-tax ($1,300 to $1,400 million after tax). The increased cost estimate includes impacts from delays as a result of COVID-19 and additional savings opportunities. The company expects the program will generate annual pre-tax cost savings of $540 to $560 million by the end of 2021 compared to 

-5-

the prior target of $500 to $550 million. Through the end of 2020, the company has incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $1,821 million pre-tax ($1,354 million after tax) and generated cumulative savings of $420 million.

2021 Outlook and Key Planning Assumptions

•Net sales increase 4 to 6 percent.

•Organic sales increase 1 to 2 percent.

•Key cost inputs expected to increase $450 to $600 million. Costs are projected to increase for most raw materials and distribution expenses.

•Adjusted nonoperating expense expected to decrease year-on-year.

•Adjusted effective tax rate of 22 to 24 percent.

•Net income from equity companies similar, to up somewhat, year-on-year.

•Adjusted earnings per share of $7.75 to $8.00 compared to $7.74 in 2020.

•Capital spending of $1,200 to $1,300 million, including spending related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program and other growth initiatives.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This news release and the accompanying tables include the following financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures:

•Adjusted earnings and earnings per share

•Adjusted gross and operating profit

•Adjusted effective tax rate

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures:

-6-

•2018 Global Restructuring Program. Mentioned elsewhere in this release.

•Softex Indonesia acquisition-related costs. The company incurred transaction and integration costs in 2020 associated with the acquisition of Softex Indonesia.

•Brazil business tax credits. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we received a favorable legal ruling that resolved certain matters related to prior years’ business taxes in Brazil.

•Property sale gain. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company recognized a gain on the sale of property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed in 2012 as part of a past restructuring.

The company provides these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures. Management and the company's Board of Directors use adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted gross and operating profit to (a) evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance and its performance relative to its competitors, (b) allocate resources and (c) measure the operational performance of the company's business units and their managers. Management also believes that the use of an adjusted effective tax rate provides improved insight into the tax effects of our ongoing business operations.

Additionally, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the company's Board of Directors has used certain of the non-GAAP financial measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals. These goals are based, in part, on the company's adjusted earnings per share and improvement in the company's adjusted return on invested capital determined by excluding certain of the adjustments that are used in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures.

This news release includes information regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, net selling prices and product mix on net sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, exited businesses and acquisitions also impact the year-over-year change in net sales.

As more fully described in Kimberly-Clark’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the company has been actively monitoring the COVID-19 situation and its impact globally. The impact of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread are affecting our business in a number of ways. We have experienced increased volatility in demand for some of our products as consumers adapt to the evolving environment. We have also experienced incidents of supply chain disruption and increased currency and commodity volatility. We expect the ultimate significance of the impact on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such circumstances continue, which will depend on the currently unknowable extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and any governmental and public actions taken in response. COVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future business performance, particularly over the near term.

Certain matters contained in this news release concerning the outlook, anticipated financial and operating results, raw material, energy and other input costs, anticipated currency rates and exchange risks, including in Argentina, net income from equity companies, sources and uses of cash, the effective tax rate, the anticipated cost savings from the company’s FORCE program, charges and savings from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program, growth initiatives, product innovations, contingencies and anticipated transactions of the company constitute forward-looking statements and are based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company. In addition, many factors outside our control, including pandemics (including the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak), epidemics, failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies from the Softex Indonesia acquisition, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the prices and availability of our raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products, energy costs, our ability to maintain key customer relationships, as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business, could affect the realization of these estimates.

There can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that the company's results will be as estimated. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them. For a description of certain factors that could cause the company's future results to differ from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements, see Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” in each of the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
