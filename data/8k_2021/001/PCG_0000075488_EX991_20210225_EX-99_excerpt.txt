SAN FRANCISCO — PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) recorded full-year losses of $1.3 billion, or $1.05 per share and fourth-quarter 2020 income available for common shareholders of $200 million, or $0.09 per share, as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This compares with losses attributable to common shareholders of $7.7 billion, or $14.50 per share, for the full year of 2019 and $3.6 billion, or $6.84 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2019.

GAAP results include non-core items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, which totaled $3.3 billion after-tax, or $2.66 per share, for the year. These results were primarily driven by costs related to PG&E Corporation’s and Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s (Utility) reorganization cases under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Chapter 11). Other non-core items include the amortization of wildfire insurance fund contributions under Assembly Bill (AB) 1054, investigation remedies, 2019-2020 wildfire-related costs, and prior period net regulatory recoveries.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility emerged from Chapter 11 on July 1, 2020 after successfully completing the restructuring process and achieving approval for their Plan of Reorganization confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court. 

“Our multi-year financial plan is based on strong, organic growth,” said Patti Poppe, CEO of PG&E Corporation. “In my many conversations with customers, policymakers, our own frontline teams, and other key stakeholders, the clearest theme is the opportunity PG&E has to help build a better future for everyone who relies on us. I am embracing that challenge with a focus on the power of the Triple Bottom Line – results that create benefits for people, the planet, and our shared prosperity. The key will be earning back trust by keeping our promises and delivering consistent, stable performance of which we can all be proud.”

2021 Priorities

In addition to continuing the 100-day listening tour she launched upon her January 4 arrival, Poppe outlined four initial priorities for 2021:

1.Implementing a lean operating system to better serve customers;

2.Assembling a team of senior leaders able to drive this organizational agenda;

3.Implementing an improved action plan to further reduce wildfire risk; and

4.Delivering on PG&E’s financial commitment of 10 percent EPS growth.

Bolstering the Senior Leadership Team 

Accordingly, the Utility appointed Adam Wright as Executive Vice President of Operations and Chief Operating Officer, where he is now responsible for all of the Utility’s operations, including Gas, Electric and Generation. He will focus on safety, seek to increase connectivity among operational groups, standardize practices, and promote excellent execution across the board. 

Further, Julius Cox was appointed Executive Vice President of People, Shared Services, and Supply Chain, and is responsible for ensuring the Utility has the people, skills, resources and tools to meet customers’ expectations. Marlene Santos will also join the Utility as Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer, responsible for the Utility’s customer contact centers; programs supporting energy efficiency, electric vehicles, rooftop solar, demand response and low-income customers; billing, metering and account services; marketing and communications; and regional leadership.

Wildfire Mitigation Update

In its February 5, 2021 Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP), the Utility detailed its ongoing strategy to further reduce wildfire risk, increase situational awareness, deploy new technology and models to help keep customers and communities safe, and continue to reduce the effects of Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS). The WMP enhances the company’s ongoing, comprehensive Community Wildfire Safety Program designed to address the growing threat of severe weather and wildfires across its service area. Specifically, it focuses on reducing wildfire potential by inspecting and repairing equipment, conducting enhanced vegetation management, and investing in grid technology and system hardening; installing more weather stations and high-definition cameras throughout the Utility service area, investing in the Utility’s Wildfire Safety Operations Center that monitors high-fire threat areas in real time; investing in meteorology to monitor weather conditions; and reducing the impacts of PSPS as a tool of last resort by upgrading the electric system and improving support for affected customers and communities.

Non-Core Asset Sale

The Utility granted a wholly owned subsidiary of SBA Communications Corporation (SBA) an exclusive license to sublicense and market wireless communications equipment attachment locations on certain electric transmission towers and other utility structures to wireless telecommunication carriers for attachment of wireless communications equipment. The arrangement also allows the SBA subsidiary to continue to market and sublicense access to the towers and structures to additional wireless providers with the Utility receiving a portion of that future revenue. SBA agreed to pay the Utility a purchase price of $973 million, of which $954 million was paid at closing. The Utility may also assign additional attachment locations upon the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions, for which SBA will make additional purchase price 

payments to the Utility. Cash proceeds received at closing were $945 million and reflected an adjustment for an estimated amount of payments received by the Utility from Carriers in the pre-closing period that are allocable to licenses in the post closing period.The Utility did not sell any electric transmission towers as part of this transaction.

The Utility also entered into a strategic relationship with SBA, through SBA’s wholly owned subsidiary, to sublicense and market equipment at additional attachment locations; as many as 28,000 electric transmission towers across the Utility’s extensive network. Through this arrangement, the Utility will receive a portion of future revenues from these sublicensed equipment attachment locations.

Overall, PG&E expects the proceeds from this agreement to help further reduce its financing needs and strengthen its financial position while also benefiting customers, who will receive a significant portion of the sale proceeds in the form of lower monthly bills as well as a portion of any future revenues from additional attachment locations.

Non-GAAP Core Earnings 

PG&E Corporation’s non-GAAP core earnings, which exclude non-core items, were $2,020 million, or $1.61 per share, for the full year 2020, compared with $2,074 million, or $3.93 per share, during the same period in 2019. For the fourth-quarter, non-GAAP core earnings were $441 million, or $0.21 per share, compared with $360 million, or $0.68 per share, during the same period in 2019.

The decrease in quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP core earnings per share was primarily driven by the increase in shares outstanding, unrecoverable interest expense, timing of nuclear refueling outages, and inspection costs, partially offset by the growth in rate base earnings, interest accrued on pre-petition payables and short-term debt, and the timing of 2020 General Rate Case cost recovery.

PG&E Corporation uses “non-GAAP core earnings,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure, in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items. See the accompanying tables for a reconciliation of non-GAAP core earnings to consolidated earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders.

Guidance

PG&E Corporation is adjusting 2021 GAAP loss guidance in the range of $0.52 to $0.38 per share, which includes non-core items. PG&E is adjusting 2021 non-core items guidance to approximately $3.1 billion after-tax. Non-core items reflect a net securitization inception charge, amortization of wildfire insurance fund contributions, bankruptcy and legal costs, investigation remedies, and 2019 Kincade fire-related costs, partially offset by prior period net regulatory recoveries.

On a non-GAAP basis, the guidance range for projected 2021 non-GAAP core earnings is $0.95 to $1.05 per share. Factors affecting non-GAAP core earnings include net below-the-line and spend above authorized of up to $100 million after-tax and unrecoverable interest expense of $300 million to $325 million after-tax. 

PG&E is also rolling forward its five-year plan and introducing non-GAAP core earnings per share growth guidance of 10 percent.

Guidance is based on various assumptions and forecasts, including those relating to authorized revenues, future expenses, capital expenditures, rate base, equity issuances, the potential securitization of certain wildfire-related costs for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, and certain other factors.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company

PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on “non-GAAP core earnings” and “non-GAAP core EPS” in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items.

Beginning with the quarter and full year periods ended December 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility changed the name of their principal non-GAAP earnings metric from "non-GAAP earnings from operations" to "non-GAAP core earnings" in order to align more closely with the terminology used by their industry peers. Likewise, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will now refer to adjustments as "non-core items" rather than "items impacting comparability."

“Non-GAAP core earnings” is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as income available for common shareholders less non-core items. “Non-core items” include items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings and affect comparability of financial results between periods, consisting of the items listed in "Reconciliation of PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders in Accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to Non-GAAP Earnings from Operations." “Non-GAAP core EPS” also referred to as “non-GAAP core earnings per share” is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as non-GAAP core earnings divided by common shares outstanding (diluted). PG&E Corporation uses non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various purposes including internal budgeting and forecasting, short- and long-term operating planning, and employee incentive compensation. PG&E Corporation believes that non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business, allowing for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance.

Non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS are not substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures such as consolidated income available for common shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
