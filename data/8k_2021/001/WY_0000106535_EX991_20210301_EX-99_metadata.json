        "ADJUSTED FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION (FAD) RECONCILIATION 60 Funds available for distribution (FAD) is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to evaluate the company's liquidity. FAD, as we define it, is net cash from operations adjusted for capital expenditures. FAD measures cash generated during the period (net of capital expenditures) that is available for dividends, repurchases of common shares, debt reduction, acquisitions, and other discretionary and nondiscretionary capital allocation activities. FAD should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our GAAP results. Adjusted funds available for distribution (Adjusted FAD) is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to evaluate the company's liquidity. Adjusted FAD, as we define it, is net cash from operations adjusted for capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items. Adjusted FAD measures cash generated during the period (net of capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items) that is available for dividends, repurchases of common shares, debt reduction, acquisitions, and other discretionary and nondiscretionary capital allocation activities. Adjusted FAD should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our GAAP results."
