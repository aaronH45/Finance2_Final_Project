RYE BROOK, N.Y., February 4, 2021 – Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.37 billion, and full-year 2020 revenue of $4.88 billion, exceeding expectations on strengthening end-market performance, despite COVID-19 related impacts. 

Fourth quarter reported operating margin was 13.0 percent, and adjusted operating margin was 13.8 percent, each declining 120 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin declined 170 basis points to 18.8 percent. COVID-related impacts and inflation drove the margin decline, exceeding productivity improvements and cost savings. Xylem generated net income of $148 million, or $0.82 per share, and adjusted net income of $145 million, or $0.81 per share, which excludes the impact of restructuring, realignment and special charges.

For the full year, Xylem delivered reported operating margin of 7.5 percent, down 180 basis points versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin of 10.8 percent, down 310 basis points for the same period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.3 percent, down 320 basis points year-over-year. The margin declines for the full year were driven by the same factors as in the fourth quarter. Full-year reported net income was $254 million, or $1.40 per share, with a reported operating margin of 7.5 percent. Adjusted net income, which excludes the impact of restructuring, realignment and special charges, was $374 million, or $2.06 per share. The 

Company generated $824 million of operating cash flow, representing a 324 percent conversion, and $641 million of free cash flow, representing a 181 percent conversion.

“Our team again delivered solid operational performance, exceeding expectations across all major indicators, including revenue, margin, and EPS,” said Patrick Decker, president and CEO of Xylem. “We drove better-than-anticipated top-line improvements in all segments, taking full advantage of stabilizing demand, demonstrated by sequential gains globally, and with particularly strong performance in Europe and China. Our improved bottom-line performance reflects effective cost containment and supply chain execution through the pandemic, and over-delivery on our free cash flow conversion commitments on the back of disciplined working capital management.”

“That performance gives us positive momentum entering 2021,” Decker continued, “as our end markets showed encouraging signs of recovery in the fourth quarter, with healthy orders trends and significant backlog growth. We also delivered strong performance with our industry-leading digital portfolio, as the pandemic continues to accelerate customer adoption of digital technologies across the water sector. This clearly positions Xylem well in both the near and long term.”

Xylem announced that its Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.28 per share, an increase of 8 percent. The dividend is payable on March 18, 2021, to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2021.

Full-year 2021 Outlook

Xylem forecasts full-year 2021 revenue in the range of $5.16 to $5.26 billion, up 6 to 8 percent on a reported basis and up 3 to 5 percent on an organic basis.

Full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 16.7 to 17.7 percent and adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 11.5 to 12.5 percent. This results in adjusted earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.60, which represents an increase of 14 to 26 percent from Xylem’s 2020 adjusted results. The Company’s adjusted earnings outlook excludes projected restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $50 to $60 million for the year. Further 2021 planning assumptions are included in Xylem’s fourth quarter 2020 earnings materials posted at www.xylem.com/investors. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort.

Fourth Quarter Segment Results

Water Infrastructure

Xylem’s Water Infrastructure segment consists of its portfolio of businesses serving clean water delivery, wastewater transport and treatment, and dewatering.

•Fourth quarter 2020 revenue was $616 million, flat organically compared with fourth quarter 2019. This result, achieved despite difficult market conditions, was driven by modest growth in the wastewater utility end market in Europe, Asia and Canada offset by softness in the U.S. industrial market. 

•Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $117 million. Adjusted operating income for the segment, which excludes $7 million of restructuring and realignment, was $124 million, a less than one percent decrease versus the comparable period last year. Reported operating margin for the segment was 19.0 percent, down 70 

basis points versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 20.1 percent, down 60 basis points versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.2 percent, down 70 basis points from the prior year. Productivity benefits, cost control and modest price realization were more than offset by inflation, increased reserves, and unfavorable volume and mix impacts. 

Applied Water

Xylem’s Applied Water segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in residential and commercial building services, and industrial applications.

•Fourth quarter 2020 Applied Water revenue was $395 million, a one percent decline organically year-over-year. Volume weakness in industrial end markets continued in the quarter, with particular softness in the U.S. and Middle East, partly offset by robust growth in the residential market in the U.S. and China. 

•Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $61 million and adjusted operating income, which excludes $1 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $62 million, a 5 percent decrease versus the comparable period last year. The segment reported operating margin was 15.4 percent, down 40 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin declined 90 basis points to 15.7 percent. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.2 percent, down 170 basis points from the prior year. Productivity benefits, favorable mix and modest price realization were more than offset by inflation and lower volumes. 

Measurement & Control Solutions

Xylem’s Measurement & Control Solutions segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in smart metering, network technologies, advanced infrastructure analytics and analytic instrumentation.

•Fourth quarter 2020 Measurement & Control Solutions revenue was $362 million, down 5 percent organically versus the prior year, lapping large project deployments in the U.S. and Middle East. Strong sequential improvement reflects healthy demand in the test business and Advanced Infrastructure Analytics, both of which were up high single digits.

•Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $14 million, and adjusted operating income, which excludes $2 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $16 million, a 45 percent decrease versus the comparable period last year. The Measurement & Control Solutions segment reported operating margin was 3.9 percent, down 330 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin of 4.4 percent also decreased 330 basis points over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.6 percent, down 350 basis points from the prior year. Strong productivity results and cost savings programs partly offset lower volume, inflation and unfavorable mix.

Xylem Inc. Non-GAAP Measures

Management reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or “adjusted”) measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following items to represent the non-GAAP measures we consider to be key performance indicators, as well as the related reconciling items to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

“Organic revenue” and “Organic orders” defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales or discontinuance of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency translation impacts is determined by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate.

“Constant currency” defined as financial results adjusted for foreign currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

“EBITDA” defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Adjusted Segment EBITDA” reflects the adjustments to EBITDA and segment EBITDA, respectively, to exclude share-based compensation charges, restructuring and realignment costs, gain or loss from sale of businesses and special charges.

“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” and “Adjusted Segment EBITDA margin” defined as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted segment EBITDA divided by total revenue and segment revenue, respectively.

“Adjusted Operating Income”, “Adjusted Segment Operating Income”, “Adjusted Net Income” and “Adjusted EPS” defined as operating income, segment operating income, net income and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude restructuring and realignment costs, gain or loss from sale of businesses, special charges and tax-related special items, as applicable.

“Adjusted Operating Margin” and “Adjusted Segment Operating Margin” defined as adjusted operating income and adjusted segment operating income divided by total revenue and segment revenue, respectively.

“Free Cash Flow” defined as net cash from operating activities, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flow, less capital expenditures, and “Free Cash Flow Conversion” defined as Free Cash Flow divided by net income, excluding the gain on sale of businesses, non-cash impairment charges and significant deferred tax items. Our definitions of “free cash flow” and “free cash flow conversion” do not consider certain non-discretionary cash payments, such as debt.

“Realignment costs” defined as costs not included in restructuring costs that are incurred as part of actions taken to reposition our business, including items such as professional fees, severance, relocation, travel, facility set-up and other costs.

“Special charges” defined as costs incurred by the Company, such as acquisition and integration related costs, non-cash impairment charges and both operating and non-operating adjustments for pension costs.

“Tax-related special items” defined as tax items, such as acquisition and integration related costs, non-cash impairment charges and both operating and non-operating adjustments for pension costs.
