​

Citigroup

Citigroup revenues of $16.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2020 decreased 10%, primarily reflecting the lower revenues in GCB, ICG, and Corporate / Other.

​

Citigroup operating expenses of $10.7 billion in the fourth quarter 2020 increased 2%, as continued investments in Citi’s transformation, including investments supporting infrastructure, risk management and controls, along with higher repositioning costs more than offset efficiency savings and reductions in discretionary spending.

​

Citigroup cost of credit of $(46) million in the fourth quarter 2020 compared to $2.2 billion in the prior-year period, largely reflecting a release of allowance for credit loss (ACL) reserves in ICG, driven by improvements in the outlook for global GDP and fewer downgrades in the portfolio, as well as lower net credit losses in GCB.

​

Citigroup net income of $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter 2020 declined 7%, driven by the lower revenues, the higher expenses, and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by the lower cost of credit. Citigroup’s effective tax rate was 20% in the current quarter compared to 12% in the fourth quarter 2019.

​

Citigroup’s allowance for credit losses on loans was $25.0 billion at quarter end, or 3.73% of total loans, compared to $12.8 billion, or 1.84% of total loans, at the end of the prior-year period. Total non-accrual assets grew 40% from the prior-year period to $5.7 billion. Consumer non-accrual loans increased 18% to $2.1 billion, while corporate non-accrual loans of $3.5 billion increased 61% from the prior-year period.

​

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $676 billion as of quarter end, down 3% from the prior-year period on a reported basis and 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation5, driven by declines across GCB and ICG, and the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate / Other.

​

Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were $1.3 trillion as of quarter end, an increase of 20% on a reported basis and 19% in constant dollars, driven by an 18% increase in GCB and a 19% increase in ICG.

​

Citigroup’s book value per share of $86.59 and tangible book value per share of $73.83 increased 4% and 5%, respectively, largely driven by net income. At quarter end, Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 11.8%, an increase from the prior quarter. Citigroup’s SLR for the fourth quarter 2020 was 7.0%, an increase from the prior quarter. During the quarter, Citigroup returned a total of $1.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends.

​

Global Consumer Banking

GCB revenues of $7.3 billion decreased 14% on a reported basis and 13% in constant dollars, as strong deposit growth and momentum in wealth management were more than offset by lower card volumes and lower interest rates across all regions, reflecting continued impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.

​

North America GCB revenues of $4.7 billion decreased 11%. Citi-Branded Cards revenues of $2.1 billion decreased 13%, reflecting lower purchase sales and higher payment rates driving lower average loans.

Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion decreased 1%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes and an improvement in mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads.

​

Latin America GCB revenues of $1.1 billion declined 20% on a reported basis and 16% in constant dollars, driven by lower loan volumes and lower deposit spreads, partially offset by strong deposit growth.

​

Asia GCB revenues of $1.6 billion declined 15% on a reported basis and 16% in constant dollars, reflecting lower cards revenues, as well as lower deposit spreads, partially offset by strong investments performance and deposit growth.

​

​

GCB cost of credit of $1.1 billion decreased 46% on a reported basis and 45% in constant dollars, as lower loan volumes and improved delinquencies led to lower net credit losses, in addition to a net ACL release of $197 million compared to a build in the prior-year period.

​

​

4

GCB net income of $1.3 billion declined 17% from the prior-year period, as reported and in constant dollars, driven by the lower revenues and higher expenses, partially offset by the lower cost of credit.

​

Banking revenues of $4.8 billion decreased 11% versus the prior year (including gain / (loss) on loan hedges)6. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion declined 8% on a reported basis and 6% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and reduced commercial card spend.

Advisory revenues decreased 38% to $232 million, while equity underwriting revenues increased 83% to $438 million and debt underwriting revenues declined 16% to $617 million. Private Bank revenues of $894 million increased 6% (excluding gain / (loss) on loan hedges), driven by strong client engagement, particularly in capital markets, as well as improved managed investments revenues and higher lending. Corporate Lending revenues of $552 million declined 25% (excluding gain / (loss) on loan hedges), driven by lower spreads, higher hedging costs and lower average volumes.

​

Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion increased 13%. Fixed Income Markets revenues of $3.1 billion increased 7%, as higher revenues across spread products and commodities were partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currencies. Equity Markets revenues of $810 million increased 57%, driven by strong performance in cash equities, derivatives, and prime finance, reflecting strong client volumes and more favorable market conditions. Securities Services revenues of $650 million were unchanged on a reported basis, but up 2% in constant dollars, as higher deposit and settlement volumes and growth in assets under custody were partially offset by lower spreads.

​

5

​

ICG cost of credit included net credit losses of $210 million, compared to $115 million in the prior-year period, and a net ACL release of $1.3 billion compared to a build of $131 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL release in the current quarter primarily reflected improvements in the outlook for global GDP, as well as fewer downgrades in the portfolio.

​

ICG net income of $3.7 billion increased 27%, as the lower cost of credit more than offset the decline in revenues and higher expenses.

1 Ratios as of December 31, 2020 are preliminary. Commencing January 1, 2020, Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio and Supplementary Leverage ratio (SLR) reflect certain deferrals based on the modified regulatory capital transition provision related to the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) standard. Excluding the deferrals based on the modified CECL transition provision, Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio and SLR as of December 31, 2020 would be 11.4% and 6.8%, respectively, on a fully reflected basis.

​

Citigroup has elected to apply the modified transition provision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies’ September 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the allowance for credit losses (after-tax) upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date has been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pre-tax) recognized through earnings for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. The corresponding adjustments on average on-balance sheet assets are also reflected in Total Leverage Exposure. Additionally, the increase in deferred tax assets (DTA) arising from temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption date has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and will phase in to RWA at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.

​

For the composition of Citigroup’s CET1 Capital and ratio, see Appendix C. For the composition of Citigroup’s SLR, see Appendix D.

​

2 Preliminary. Citigroup’s return on average tangible common equity (RoTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. RoTCE represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity (TCE). For the components of the calculation, see Appendix A.

​

3 Citigroup’s payout ratio is the sum of common dividends and common share repurchases divided by net income available to common shareholders. For the components of the calculation, see Appendix A.

​

4 Citigroup’s tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of this measure to reported results, see Appendix E.

​

5 Results of operations excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation (constant dollar basis) are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to reported results, see Appendix B.

​

6 Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the private bank and corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains / (losses) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. In the fourth quarter 2020, gains / (losses) on loan hedges included $(298) million related to Corporate Lending and $(14) million related to the Private Bank, compared to losses of $(93) million related to Corporate Lending in the prior-year period. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the Private Bank and Corporate Lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains / (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.
