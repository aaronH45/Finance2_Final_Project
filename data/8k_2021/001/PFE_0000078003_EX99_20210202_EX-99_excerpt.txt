EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

Dr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “2020 has been a transformational year, not only for Pfizer, but also in the life of every patient in every community that we serve. As a company, we saw the culmination of Pfizer’s decade-long conversion into a pure-play, science and innovation-focused company. Right away, our ability to move quickly and utilize cutting-edge science to help address the world’s most important medical challenges was put to the test by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our record-breaking success at developing a vaccine against COVID-19, along with our partner BioNTech, is just one example of what we believe this new Pfizer is capable of achieving. As the world looks forward to 2021 with renewed hope for better days ahead, we also look forward with renewed confidence and resolve in our ability to fulfill our purpose, to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives.”

Frank D’Amelio, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Global Supply, stated: “I am very pleased with how our company performed in 2020, and particularly in the fourth quarter, where we achieved double digit operational revenue growth driven by a wide range of products and geographies, including growth within all of our therapeutic areas. I was also pleased that Pfizer completed the transaction to combine Upjohn with Mylan to form Viatris in the fourth quarter, which I believe positions both Pfizer and Viatris for a bright future. I feel confident in our ability to continue to perform well and deliver on our commitments in 2021 and beyond, both to our patients and to our shareholders.”

Results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 and 2019(6) are summarized below.

OVERALL RESULTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Indicates calculation not meaningful.

REVENUES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues and expenses associated with the Upjohn Business(1) for all periods presented have been recategorized as discontinued operations and excluded from Adjusted(2) results. Pfizer’s Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products, which had been reported within the results of the Upjohn Business(1), is now included within the Hospital therapeutic area for all periods presented. 

- 2 -

Following the completion of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business(1) in the fourth quarter of 2020, we now operate as a single focused innovative biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide.

Acquisitions and other business development activities completed in 2019 and 2020 impacted financial results in the periods presented(1). Some amounts in this press release may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates(7).

2021 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE(4)(8)

Financial guidance reflects management’s current expectations for operational performance, foreign exchange rates as well as management’s current projections as to the severity, duration and global macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Key guidance assumptions included in these projections broadly reflect a continued recovery in macroeconomic and healthcare activity throughout 2021 as more of the population becomes vaccinated against COVID-19. These assumptions are guided by the trajectory of current infection rates in many parts of the world and the expected timeline for broad access to effective vaccines. 

Pfizer raised its guidance range for Adjusted Diluted EPS(2) provided on January 12, 2021 due primarily to additional refinements of its COVID-19 vaccine revenue forecast and is providing for the first time 2021 financial guidance for other income statement line items. Current 2021 financial guidance is presented below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The midpoint of the guidance range for revenues represents 44% growth from 2020 revenues, including an expected $1.4 billion, or 3%, favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. The midpoint of the updated guidance range for Adjusted diluted EPS(2) reflects a 42% increase over 2020 actual results, including an 

- 3 -

expected $0.09, or 4%, benefit due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. 

Financial guidance for Adjusted diluted EPS(2) is calculated using approximately 5.7 billion weighted average shares outstanding, and does not currently assume any share repurchases in 2021.

Assumptions Related to BNT162b2 Within Guidance

Given the significant impact that BNT162b2 is expected to have on the company’s overall results in 2021, Pfizer is providing additional details on the revenue and margin assumptions incorporated within the above guidance ranges. These assumptions are summarized below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The BNT162b2 revenue projection incorporated within Pfizer’s 2021 financial guidance primarily includes doses that are expected to be delivered in 2021 under existing contracts, and may be adjusted in the future as additional contracts are executed. 

Adjusted(2) IBT margin guidance for BNT162b2 incorporates the current expectation for revenues for the product, less anticipated Adjusted(2) costs to manufacture, market and distribute BNT162b2, including applicable royalty expenses and a 50% gross margin split with BioNTech, as well as shared R&D expenses related to BNT162b2 and costs associated with other assets currently in development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. It does not include an allocation of corporate or other overhead costs.

Selected Financial Guidance Ranges Excluding BNT162b2 

To demonstrate Pfizer’s performance against management’s stated long-term growth goals for its business excluding BNT162b2, Pfizer is providing 2021 revenue, Adjusted Cost of Sales(2) as a percentage of revenues and Adjusted diluted EPS(2) guidance ranges with BNT162b2 contributions excluded. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

- 4 -

The midpoint of the revenue guidance range above reflects approximately 6% operational growth compared to 2020 when all revenue impacts related to BNT162b2 are excluded from both periods, which is in line with the company’s stated goal of at least a 6% revenue compound annual growth rate through 2025. The midpoint of Pfizer’s Adjusted Diluted EPS(2) guidance range excluding BNT162b2 reflects approximately 11% operational growth compared to the prior year.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

▪During full-year 2020, Pfizer paid $8.4 billion of cash dividends, composed of quarterly dividends of $0.38 per share of common stock.

▪No share repurchases were made in 2020 and no shares have been repurchased to date in 2021. As of February 2, 2021, Pfizer’s remaining share repurchase authorization is $5.3 billion. Current 2021 financial guidance does not reflect any share repurchases in 2021.

▪Fourth-quarter 2020 diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate Reported(3) and Adjusted(2) diluted EPS was 5,662 million shares, an increase of 31 million shares compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to shares issued for employee compensation programs.

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Fourth-Quarter 2020 vs. Fourth-Quarter 2019) 

Fourth-quarter 2020 revenues totaled $11.7 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 12%, compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting operational growth of $1.1 billion, or 11%, as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $100 million, or 1%. Operational growth was primarily driven by:

▪Vyndaqel/Vyndamax globally, up 96% operationally, driven by the continued strong performance of the launch of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) indication in the U.S. and Japan in 2019 and the European Union (EU) approval of the ATTR-CM indication in 2020;

▪Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, up 10% operationally, primarily driven by: 

–36% operational growth in developed Europe, reflecting increased adult uptake in certain markets resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses, including specifically pneumococcal disease, due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and

–11% growth in the U.S., due to the favorable impact of timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication, partially offset by a decline in the adult indication reflecting the impact of the revised Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for the adult indication to 

- 5 -

shared clinical decision making, as well as the continued impact of a lower remaining eligible adult population;

▪BNT162b2, which was granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S. in December 2020, and which contributed $154 million in sales in the fourth quarter;

▪Eliquis, up 14% operationally, led by growth in the emerging markets, developed Europe and the U.S., driven primarily by continued increased adoption in non-valvular atrial fibrillation as well as oral anti-coagulant market share gains. In the U.S., strong volume growth was partially offset by a lower net price due to an increased impact from the Medicare “coverage gap” and unfavorable channel mix;

▪Ibrance globally, up 11% operationally, primarily driven by strong cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) class penetration and Ibrance’s continued CDK leadership in metastatic breast cancer; 

▪Xeljanz globally, up 14% operationally, primarily driven by:

–13% growth in the U.S., primarily reflecting higher volumes within the rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ulcerative colitis (UC) indications, driven by reaching additional patients through improvements in formulary access, partially offset by increased discounts from recently-signed contracts which were entered into in order to unlock access to additional patient lives; and

–16% operational growth in international markets, primarily reflecting continued uptake in the RA indication and, to a lesser extent, the UC indication in certain developed markets;

▪Inlyta globally, up 41% operationally, primarily reflecting increased demand in the U.S. and developed Europe following the approvals in 2019 for combinations of certain immune checkpoint inhibitors and Inlyta for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma; and

▪Xtandi in the U.S., up 16%, primarily driven by continued strong demand in the metastatic and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer indications, as well as the metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer indication, which was approved in the U.S. in December 2019; as well as

▪Biosimilars, which grew 86% operationally to $525 million, primarily driven by recent oncology biosimilar launches of Ruxience (rituximab), Zirabev (bevacizumab) and Trazimera (trastuzumab) in the U.S. and other global markets, as well as continued growth from Retacrit (epoetin), primarily in the U.S.,

- 6 -

partially offset primarily by lower revenues for:

▪Chantix in the U.S., down 40%, driven by the loss of patent protection in the U.S. in November 2020, as well as a negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a decline in patient visits to doctors for preventative health purposes; and

▪Enbrel internationally, down 18% operationally, primarily reflecting continued biosimilar competition in most developed Europe markets as well as in Brazil and Japan.

GAAP Reported(3) Income Statement Highlights

SELECTED REPORTED COSTS AND EXPENSES(3)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth-quarter 2020 Cost of Sales(3) as a percentage of revenues increased 5.0 percentage points compared with the prior-year quarter. The primary drivers for the increase include: 

▪the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, which unfavorably impacted Cost of Sales(3) more than it favorably impacted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020; 

▪unfavorable changes in product mix, including increased sales of lower margin products such as BNT162b2, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher alliance revenues;

▪an unfavorable year-over-year impact of cash flow hedging on inventory; and

▪additional COVID-19-related expenses.

SI&A Expenses(3) were essentially flat in fourth-quarter 2020 compared with the prior-year quarter. 

- 7 -

Fourth-quarter 2020 R&D Expenses(3) increased compared with the prior-year quarter, which primarily reflects, among other things, spending on Pfizer’s efforts to develop BNT162b2 and other potential vaccines and therapeutics to help prevent and treat COVID-19.

Pfizer recorded lower other deductions––net(3) in fourth-quarter 2020 compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by reductions in asset impairment charges, pension-related costs and expenses associated with certain legal matters, partially offset by higher net losses on asset disposals and lower net gains on equity securities.

Pfizer recorded a tax benefit on Reported income(3) of $0.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a tax benefit of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily related to the non-recurrence of the tax benefits related to certain tax initiatives associated with the implementation of a new organizational structure as well as lower tax benefits related to the impairment of intangible assets.

Adjusted(2) Income Statement Highlights

SELECTED ADJUSTED COSTS AND EXPENSES(2)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Indicates calculation not meaningful.

Adjusted Cost of Sales(2) as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter increased 4.8 percentage points compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the factors listed in the Reported(3) section above.

On a full-year basis, Adjusted Cost of Sales(2) as a percentage of revenues increased 0.9 percentage points compared to the prior year. 

A full reconciliation of Reported(3) to Adjusted(2) financial measures and associated footnotes can be found in the financial tables section of this press release.

▪Prevnar 13 in the U.S.; and

▪Chantix in the U.S.

Full-year 2020 revenues for consumer healthcare products declined by $2.1 billion, or 100% operationally, reflecting the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction with GSK(1). 

RECENT NOTABLE DEVELOPMENTS (Since October 27, 2020)

Product Developments

▪Bavencio (avelumab) -- In January 2021, EMD Serono, the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, and Pfizer announced that the European Commission (EC) approved Bavencio as monotherapy for the first-line maintenance treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who 

- 9 -

are progression-free following platinum-based chemotherapy. 

▪Lorbrena (lorlatinib) -- In December 2020, Pfizer announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for lorlatinib as a first-line treatment for people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The sNDA is based on data from the pivotal CROWN study and is being reviewed by the FDA under its Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA is in April 2021.

▪Xalkori (crizotinib) -- In January 2021, Pfizer announced that the FDA approved the sNDA for Xalkori for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and young adults with relapsed or refractory, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma that is anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive. 

▪Xeljanz (tofacitinib) 

–In November 2020, Pfizer announced positive results from a Phase 3 investigational study evaluating the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The study met its primary and key secondary endpoint of Assessment in SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 20 and 40 response, respectively, compared to placebo at week 16. The FDA has accepted Pfizer’s application for the AS indication and the PDUFA goal date is in Q2 2021.

–In January 2021, Pfizer announced co-primary endpoint results from ORAL Surveillance, a post-marketing required study which evaluated the safety of tofacitinib at two doses (5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily) versus a TNF inhibitor (TNFi) in subjects with RA who were 50 years of age or older and had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. The co-primary endpoints of this study were non-inferiority of tofacitinib compared to TNFi in regard to major adverse cardiovascular events and malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer). Results showed that for these co-primary endpoints, the prespecified non-inferiority criteria were not met for the primary comparison of the combined tofacitinib doses to TNFi. Additionally, based on the prespecified secondary comparisons, there was no evidence of a difference in the primary endpoints between the two tofacitinib treatment groups. Pfizer is analyzing data beyond the co-primary endpoints and working with regulatory agencies to review the full results and analyses as they become available. 

Pipeline Developments

A comprehensive update of Pfizer’s development pipeline was published today and is now available at www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline. It includes an overview of Pfizer’s research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as mechanism of action for some candidates in Phase 1 and all candidates from Phase 2 through registration.

- 10 -

As of the end of 2020, Pfizer achieved Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3/registration and end-to-end clinical success rates beyond the industry averages. These metrics also demonstrate a significant improvement in Pfizer’s clinical success rate metrics compared to the same metrics from 5 years ago, leading to an end-to-end clinical success rate of 21% as of the end of 2020, up from 5% as of the end of 2015.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Below are specific updates on pipeline assets since our previous earnings announcement on October 27, 2020:

▪Abrocitinib (PF-04965842) -- In November 2020, Pfizer announced positive top-line results from the fifth Phase 3 trial of abrocitinib, JADE REGIMEN, a 52-week study which investigated abrocitinib in patients 12 and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) following response to initial open label induction treatment with abrocitinib 200 mg. Patients were randomized into one of three arms: 200 mg, 100 mg or placebo. Both doses of abrocitinib met the primary endpoint, resulting in significantly fewer patients experiencing a loss of response requiring rescue treatment compared to those randomized to placebo. Both doses also met the key secondary endpoint of a larger percentage of patients maintaining an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) response of clear or almost clear relative to placebo.

▪BNT162b2 (COVID-19 Vaccine) Development Program

–Clinical and Research Developments

•In November 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that BNT162b2 met both of the Phase 3 study’s primary efficacy endpoints at the final efficacy analysis. Analysis of the data indicated a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% for the prevention of COVID-19, measured from 7 days after the second dose. Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. The observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%. Of the 10 severe cases of COVID-19 observed in the trial at the time of the analysis, nine of the cases occurred in the placebo group and one in the BNT162b2 vaccinated group. No serious safety concerns related to the vaccine were observed in the trial, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination.

- 11 -

•In January 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech announced results from an in vitro study that provides additional data on the capability of sera from individuals immunized with BNT162b2 to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 U.K. strain, also known as B.1.1.7 lineage or VOC 202012/01. The study found that sera of participants from the previously reported German Phase 1/2 trial inhibited pseudovirus bearing the full set of U.K. strain spike mutations in a neutralization range that is regarded as biologically equivalent to the unmutated Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike, making it likely that COVID-19 caused by the U.K. virus variant will also be prevented by immunization with BNT162b2. However, further data are needed to monitor BNT162b2’s effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. 

•In January 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech announced results from in vitro neutralization studies in which three engineered viruses with key mutations present in the U.K. and South Africa variants were tested against a panel of human sera from 20 participants vaccinated with BNT162b2 in the previously reported Phase 3 trial. Of the three recombinant variants, one has a mutation common to both the U.K. and South Africa variants (N501Y), one has mutations common to the U.K. variant (Δ69/70+N501Y+D614G), and the third has mutations common to the South Africa variant (E484K+N501Y+D614G). The sera from individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 neutralized all the SARS-CoV-2 strains tested, although neutralization against the virus with the three key mutations present in the South African variant was slightly lower when compared to neutralization of virus containing the other mutations that were evaluated. While these findings do not indicate the need for a new vaccine to address the emerging variants, Pfizer and BioNTech are prepared to respond if a variant of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates evidence of escaping immunity by BNT162b2.

–Regulatory Developments

•On December 2, 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the U.K. granted a temporary authorization for emergency use for BNT162b2 against COVID-19. This constituted the developed world’s first authorization for emergency use for a vaccine to prevent COVID-19. 

•On December 11, 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the FDA authorized the emergency use of BNT162b2 against COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age or older. The vaccine is authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) while Pfizer and BioNTech gather additional data and prepare to file a planned Biologics License Application (BLA) with the FDA for a possible full regulatory approval in 2021(9).

•On December 21, 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the EC has granted a conditional marketing authorization (CMA) to Pfizer and BioNTech for BNT162b2 for active immunization 

- 12 -

to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older. The CMA is valid in all 27 member states of the EU.

•BNT162b2 has now been granted a CMA, EUA or temporary authorization in more than 50 countries worldwide.

–Commercial Developments

•In December 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced a second agreement with the U.S. government to supply an additional 100 million doses of BNT162b2 from production facilities in the U.S. This agreement brings the total number of doses to be delivered to the U.S. to 200 million. The companies now expect to deliver the full 200 million doses to the U.S. government by the end of May 2021. Consistent with the original agreement announced in July 2020, the U.S. government will pay $1.95 billion for the additional 100 million doses.

•In December 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced they will supply an additional 100 million doses of BNT162b2 to the 27 EU member states in 2021. This announcement is a result of the EC’s decision to exercise its option to purchase an additional 100 million doses under its Advanced Purchase Agreement signed on November 11, 2020. This agreement brings the total number of doses to be delivered to the EU to 300 million.

•In January 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech announced an advance purchase agreement with COVAX for up to 40 million doses, to be delivered throughout 2021. COVAX is a global initiative to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of income levels. COVAX includes an Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) financial mechanism that aims to ensure that 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries will be able to secure access to COVID-19 vaccines at the same time as higher-income countries. For the COVAX AMC 92 countries, Pfizer and BioNTech will provide the vaccine to COVAX at a not-for-profit price. Supply of the vaccine is subject to the negotiation and execution of additional agreements under the COVAX Facility structure.

▪Elranatamab (PF-06863135) 

–In December 2020, Pfizer announced safety and clinical response results from an ongoing Phase 1 study for elranatamab, a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CD3-targeted bispecific antibody. Data from 30 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma showed manageable safety across all subcutaneous dose levels with no dose-limiting toxicities observed, and 83% of patients achieved a 

- 13 -

clinical response at the highest dose level of 1,000 μg/kg weekly, which is the recommended Phase 2 dose. 

–In January 2021, elranatamab received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who are refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory drug and one anti-CD38 antibody.

▪Giroctocogene fitelparvovec (SB-525 or PF-07055480) -- In December 2020, Pfizer and Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. announced updated follow-up data from the Phase 1/2 Alta study of giroctocogene fitelparvovec, an investigational gene therapy for patients with severe hemophilia A. All five patients in the high dose 3 x 1013 vg/kg cohort have had at least one year of follow-up and showed sustained factor VIII (FVIII) activity levels, with a group median FVIII activity of 56.9% and a group geometric mean FVIII activity of 70.4% via chromogenic assay from week 9 to 52.

▪Marstacimab (PF-06741086) -- In November 2020, Pfizer announced that the first participant has been dosed in the Phase 3 BASIS study of marstacimab, an anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor. BASIS is a global Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study evaluating annualized bleed rate through 12 months on treatment with marstacimab in approximately 145 adolescent and adult participants between ages 12 to <75 years with severe hemophilia A or B (defined as factor VIII or factor IX activity <1%, respectively), with or without inhibitors.

▪PF-06482077 (20-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine candidate) -- In December 2020, Pfizer announced that the FDA accepted for priority review a BLA for its 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate, as submitted for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in the vaccine in adults ages 18 years and older. The PDUFA goal date for a decision by the FDA is in June 2021.

▪PF-06939926 (Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene therapy) -- In January 2021, Pfizer announced that the first participant has been dosed in the Phase 3 CIFFREO study, which will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PF-06939926, in boys with DMD. The CIFFREO trial is expected to enroll 99 ambulatory male patients, ages 4 through 7, across 55 clinical trial sites in 15 countries. The first patient was dosed at a site in Barcelona, Spain on December 29, 2020.

▪Recifercept -- In December 2020, Pfizer announced that the first participants were dosed in the global Phase 2 multiple dose, randomized study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of recifercept in children with achondroplasia. 

▪Relugolix -- In January 2021, Myovant Sciences (Myovant) and Pfizer announced that the Phase 3 SPIRIT long-term extension study of the investigational once-daily relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg 

- 14 -

plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women with endometriosis reported clinically meaningful reductions in dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain) and non-menstrual pelvic pain over one year (52 weeks) with minimal and stable bone mineral density loss. The data are consistent with the efficacy and safety profile observed through 24 weeks in the Phase 3 SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 studies. These results will be included in the New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for relugolix combination tablet for the treatment of women with endometriosis, anticipated to be submitted in the first half of 2021.

▪Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600) -- In January 2021, ritlecitinib (JAK3-TEC selective) oral small molecule reported positive top-line results in two Phase 2 studies, one for vitiligo and one demonstrating strong clinical remission rates in ulcerative colitis. Data from both studies will be presented at scientific congresses later this year. 

▪Somatrogon (MOD-4023) -- In January 2021, Pfizer and OPKO Health Inc. announced that the FDA has accepted for filing the initial BLA for somatrogon, a long-acting human growth hormone that is intended to be administered once-weekly for the treatment of pediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency.

▪In November 2020, Pfizer announced that it completed the transaction to spin off its Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan N.V. (Mylan) to form Viatris Inc. (Viatris). Under the terms of the transaction, which was structured as an all-stock Reverse Morris Trust, Upjohn Inc. was spun off to Pfizer stockholders by way of a pro rata distribution and immediately thereafter combined with Mylan. In the distribution, Pfizer stockholders received approximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock for every one share of Pfizer common stock held as of the close of business on the record date. As of the closing of the combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan shareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis.

▪In December 2020, Myovant and Pfizer announced a collaboration to develop and commercialize relugolix – a once-daily, oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist – in advanced prostate cancer and women’s health in the U.S. and Canada. Pfizer also received an exclusive option to commercialize relugolix in oncology outside the U.S. and Canada, excluding certain Asian countries.

For additional details, see the attached financial schedules, product revenue tables and disclosure notice.

(1)The following acquisitions and other business development activity impacted financial results for the periods presented:

▪On December 28, 2020, Myovant Sciences (Myovant) and Pfizer announced a collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize relugolix in advanced prostate cancer and women’s health in the U.S. and Canada, beginning in early 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, Myovant is entitled to receive up to $4.35 billion in total milestone payments -- including a $650 million up-front payment -- if certain regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved. 

▪On November 16, 2020, Pfizer completed the transaction to spin off its Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan N.V. (Mylan) to form Viatris Inc. Under the terms of the transaction, which was structured as an all-stock Reverse Morris Trust, Upjohn Inc. was spun off to Pfizer stockholders by way of a pro rata distribution and immediately thereafter combined with Mylan. As a result of this transaction, historical contributions from the Upjohn Business are being treated as a discontinued operation.

▪On September 30, 2020, Pfizer and CStone Pharmaceuticals (CStone) announced the formation of a strategic collaboration between CStone and multiple subsidiaries of Pfizer which encompasses a $200 million equity investment by Pfizer in CStone, a collaboration for the development and commercialization of CStone’s PD-L1 antibody (sugemalimab) and a framework between the companies to bring additional oncology assets to the Greater China market.

▪On June 8, 2020, Valneva SE (Valneva) announced that the antitrust-related condition precedent was met and, consequently, the agreement between Valneva and Pfizer that was previously announced in April 2020 became effective. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will co-develop and commercialize Valneva’s Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15, which is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies. In connection with the agreement, Pfizer paid Valneva an upfront cash payment of $130 million in second-quarter 2020.

▪On April 9, 2020, Pfizer signed a global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a first-in-class, mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program, BNT162, aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection. In connection with the agreement, Pfizer paid BioNTech an upfront cash payment of $72 million in second-quarter 2020. Pfizer also made an equity investment of $113 million in BioNTech common stock. Pfizer made an additional investment of $50 million in common stock of BioNTech as part of an underwritten equity offering by BioNTech, which closed in July 2020. 

- 16 -

▪On July 31, 2019, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) completed a transaction that combined the two companies’ respective consumer healthcare businesses into a joint venture (JV), operating under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange for contributing its Consumer Healthcare business to the JV, Pfizer received a 32% equity stake in the JV and GSK owns the remaining 68% of the JV. Upon the closing of the transaction, Pfizer deconsolidated its Consumer Healthcare business and began recording its share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions––net, commencing from August 1, 2019. Therefore, Pfizer recorded its share of the JV’s earnings generated in third-quarter 2020 in its fourth-quarter 2020 operating results. Likewise, Pfizer recorded its share of the JV’s earnings generated in fourth-quarter 2019 and in the first three quarters of 2020 in its operating results for full-year 2020.

▪On July 30, 2019, Pfizer announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Array BioPharma Inc. (Array). Array’s portfolio included two approved products, Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib).

▪On July 1, 2019, Pfizer announced the successful completion of its acquisition of the privately held clinical-stage biotechnology company, Therachon Holding AG. 

(2)Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. GAAP net income/(loss)(3) and its components and reported diluted EPS or LPS(3) excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items (some of which may recur, such as gains on the completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or gains and losses from equity securities, but which management does not believe are reflective of ongoing core operations). Adjusted cost of sales, Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses, Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses and Adjusted other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as, and therefore components of, the overall Adjusted income measure. As described in the Financial Review––Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income) section of Pfizer’s 2019 Financial Report, which was filed as Exhibit 13 to Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, management uses Adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. Because Adjusted income is an important internal measurement for Pfizer, management believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. Pfizer reports Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income, and Adjusted diluted EPS in order to present the results of the company’s major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines and vaccines––prior to considering certain income statement elements. See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted information for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and 2019. The Adjusted income and its 

- 17 -

components and Adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income/(loss) and its components and diluted EPS or LPS(3).

(3)Revenues is defined as revenues in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Reported net income/(loss) and its components are defined as net income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. and its components in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) and reported loss per share (LPS) are defined as diluted EPS or LPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(4)Financial guidance for full-year 2021 reflects the following:

▪Does not assume the completion of any business development transactions not completed as of December 31, 2020, including any one-time upfront payments associated with such transactions. 

▪Includes Pfizer’s pro rata share of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture(1) anticipated earnings, which is recorded in Adjusted other (income)/deductions(2) on a one-quarter lag. 

▪Reflects an anticipated negative revenue impact of $1.0 billion due to recent and expected generic and biosimilar competition for certain products that have recently lost or are anticipated to soon lose patent protection. 

▪Exchange rates assumed are as of mid-January 2021. Financial guidance reflects the anticipated favorable impact of approximately $1.4 billion on revenues and approximately $0.09 on Adjusted diluted EPS(2) as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to foreign exchange rates from 2020. 

▪Guidance for Adjusted diluted EPS(2) assumes diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 5.7 billion shares, which currently assumes no share repurchases in 2021. 

▪Guidance for Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions(2) includes an estimated benefit of approximately $300 million resulting from an anticipated change in pension accounting policy to begin recognizing actuarial gains and losses immediately through GAAP earnings compared to how they would have been recognized under the current accounting methodology. This anticipated change is expected to go into effect in the first quarter of 2021 and will require recasting prior period amounts to conform to the new accounting policy.

(5)Success rates are based on a 5-year rolling average for Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, and a 3-year rolling average for Phase 1 studies, with the cut-off for the Pfizer analysis ending on fiscal year-end 2020 and the cut-off for the industry’s analysis ending on fiscal year-end 2019, which is the most recent information available. The analysis includes only studies involving new molecular entities. The “industry” in this 

- 18 -

analysis was based on the Pharmaceutical Benchmarking Forum’s participant companies: AbbVie, Inc.; Allergan PLC (which was acquired by AbbVie, Inc. in May 2020); Bayer AG; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; Eli Lilly and Company; Gilead Sciences, Inc.; Johnson & Johnson Corporation; Merck & Co, Inc.; Novartis AG; Pfizer; Roche, Inc. and Sanofi S.A.

(6)Pfizer’s fiscal year-end for international subsidiaries is November 30 while Pfizer’s fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is December 31. Therefore, Pfizer’s fourth quarter and full year for U.S. subsidiaries reflects the three and twelve months ended on December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 while Pfizer’s fourth quarter and full year for subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. reflects the three and twelve months ended on November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2019.

(7)References to operational variances in this press release pertain to period-over-period growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although exchange rate changes are part of Pfizer’s business, they are not within Pfizer’s control. However, they can mask positive or negative trends in the business; therefore, Pfizer believes presenting operational variances excluding exchange rates provides useful information to evaluate Pfizer’s results.

(8)Pfizer does not provide guidance for GAAP Reported financial measures (other than revenues) or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP Reported financial measures on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, gains and losses from equity securities and potential future asset impairments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP Reported results for the guidance period. 

(9)BNT162b2 has not been approved or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for use in individuals 16 years of age and older. The emergency use of this product is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564 (b) (1) of the FD&C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.

(1)The financial statements present the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. are included for the three and twelve months ended November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2019.

On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris, an independent publicly traded company. On December 21, 2020, Pfizer and Viatris completed the termination of a pre-existing strategic collaboration between Pfizer and Mylan for generic drugs in Japan (Mylan-Japan) and we transferred the operations that were part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration are reported as Income from discontinued operations––net of tax for all periods presented. Prior-period financial information has been restated, as appropriate.

The Array BioPharma Inc. (Array) and Therachon Holding AG acquisitions and the contribution of our Consumer Healthcare business to the Consumer Healthcare joint venture (JV) that were completed in 2019, as well as other business development activities in 2020, impacted our results of operations in the periods presented. Upon the closing of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction, we deconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business and recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.1 billion ($5.4 billion, net of tax) in our fiscal third quarter of 2019 in (Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction for the difference in the fair value of our 32% equity stake in the new company and the carrying value of our Consumer Healthcare business. Our financial results, and our Consumer Healthcare business results, for full-year 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare business domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare business international operations. Our financial results for 2020 do not reflect any contribution from the Consumer Healthcare business. We record our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions––net commencing from August 1, 2019. Therefore, our operating results (i) for fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 include our share of two months of the Consumer Healthcare JV’s earnings/losses generated in the third quarter of 2019, (ii) for the fourth quarter of 2020 include our share of the Consumer Healthcare JV’s earnings/losses generated in the third quarter of 2020 and (iii) for full-year 2020 include our share of the Consumer Healthcare JV’s earnings/losses generated in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first nine months of 2020. See footnote (5) below.

Certain amounts in the consolidated statements of income and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.

(2)Exclusive of amortization of intangible assets, except as discussed in footnote (3) below.

(3)Amortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets, as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization of intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.

(4)Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs include the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Includes employee termination costs, asset impairments and other exit costs associated with business combinations. Credits for full-year 2019 were mostly due to the reversal of certain accruals related to our acquisition of Wyeth upon the effective favorable settlement of a U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for multiple years. See footnote (6) below.

(b)Includes employee termination costs, asset impairments and other exit costs not associated with acquisitions.

(c)Transaction costs represent external costs for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services. 

(d)Integration costs and other represent external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses, such as expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes, and certain other qualifying costs. For full-year 2019, integration costs and other were mainly related to our acquisitions of Array and Hospira, Inc.

(5)Components of Other (income)/deductions––net include:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)In the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily includes intangible asset impairment charges of $528 million related to Eucrisa, a finite-lived developed technology right acquired in connection with our acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and reflects updated commercial forecasts mainly reflecting competitive pressures. Full-year 2020 primarily includes $900 million related to in-process research and development (IPR&D) assets acquired in connection with our Array acquisition and the $528 million related to Eucrisa, noted above. In the fourth quarter and full-year 2019, primarily included an intangible asset impairment charge of $2.6 billion, related to Eucrisa, and reflects updated commercial forecasts mainly reflecting competitive pressures. In full-year 2019, also included intangible asset impairment charges of $181 million, $90 million of which represented IPR&D related to a pre-clinical stage asset from our acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc. for gene therapies for the potential treatment of patients with certain rare diseases.

(b)In 2019, represented incremental costs associated with the design, planning and implementation of our then new business structure, effective in the beginning of 2019, and primarily included consulting, legal, tax and other advisory services.

(c)The income for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 represents our pro-rata share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV, partially offset by equity method basis difference write-offs and amortization. For additional information, see footnote (1) above.

(d)The fourth quarter and full-year 2020 include, among other things, dividend income of $82 million for the fourth quarter and $278 million for full-year 2020 from our investment in ViiV Healthcare Limited (ViiV). The fourth quarter of 2019 included, among other things, dividend income of $36 million from our investment in ViiV. Full-year 2019 included, among other things, (i) dividend income of $220 million from our investment in ViiV, (ii) charges of $152 million for external incremental costs, such as transaction costs and costs to separate our Consumer Healthcare business into a separate legal entity, associated with the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV and (iii) net losses on early retirement of debt of $138 million.

(6)The decrease in tax benefits for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, was primarily due to the non-recurrence of the tax benefits related to certain tax initiatives associated with the implementation of a new organizational structure, as well as lower tax benefits related to the impairment of intangible assets. The increase in the effective tax rate for full-year 2020, compared to full-year 2019, was due to the aforementioned factors above as well as (i) the non-recurrence of $1.4 billion in tax benefits, representing taxes and interest, recorded in the second quarter of 2019 due to the favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years and (ii) the non-recurrence of a tax benefit recorded in the first nine months of 2019 as a result of additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury related to the legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, partially offset by (iii) the non-recurrence of the tax expense associated with the gain related to the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction with GSK and (iv) the favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business.

(7)For fourth-quarter 2019, we used basic weighted average shares of 5,535 million (excluding common-share equivalents) to calculate Loss per common share––diluted on Net loss attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders.

Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement (as described in the Financial Review––Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income) section of Pfizer’s 2019 Financial Report, which was filed as Exhibit 13 to Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019), Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.

(5)Exclusive of amortization of intangible assets, except as discussed in footnote (6) below.

(6)Amortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization of intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.

(a)Total International represents Developed Europe region + Developed Rest of World region + Emerging Markets region. Details for these regions are described in footnotes (h) to (j) below, respectively.

(b)

On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris, an independent publicly traded company. On December 21, 2020, Pfizer and Viatris completed the termination of a pre-existing strategic collaboration between Pfizer and Mylan for generic drugs in Japan (Mylan-Japan) and we transferred the operations that were part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration are reported as Income from discontinued operations––net of tax for all periods presented. Prior-period financial information has been restated, as appropriate. Prior to the separation of the Upjohn Business, and beginning in 2020, Upjohn began managing our Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products, and the Mylan-Japan collaboration. As a result, revenues associated with our Meridian subsidiary, except for product revenues for EpiPen sold in Canada, and Mylan-Japan were reported in Upjohn beginning in the first quarter of 2020. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the results of our Meridian subsidiary are reported in the Hospital therapeutic area for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.

(c)Biosimilars are highly similar versions of approved and authorized biological medicines and primarily include revenues from Inflectra/Remsima, Retacrit, Ruxience and Zirabev.

(d)Hospital is a therapeutic area that commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines. Hospital also includes Pfizer CentreOne(e). All other Hospital primarily includes revenues from legacy Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals (SIP) products (that are not anti-infective products) and, to a much lesser extent, solid oral dose products (that are not anti-infective products). SIP anti-infective products that are not individually listed above are recorded in “All other Anti-infectives”.

(e)Pfizer CentreOne includes revenues from our contract manufacturing and active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation, including sterile injectables contract manufacturing, and revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements.

(f)On July 31, 2019, our Consumer Healthcare business, an over-the-counter medicines business, was combined with GSK’s consumer healthcare business to form a new consumer healthcare joint venture, of which we own 32%. Upon the closing of the transaction, we deconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business. Our financial results and our Consumer Healthcare business results for 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare business domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare business international operations. Our financial results for 2020 do not reflect any contribution from the Consumer Healthcare business.

(g)Total Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals represents the total of all branded and generic injectable products in the Hospital therapeutic area, including anti-infective sterile injectable pharmaceuticals.
