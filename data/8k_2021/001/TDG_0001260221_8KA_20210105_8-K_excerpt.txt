Explanatory Note

TransDigm Group Incorporated (“TransDigm Group” or the "Company") is filing this Amendment No. 1 to Form 8-K (“Form 8-K/A”) solely to amend the classification of reported events to be disclosed under Item 8.01 of Form 8-K. The reported events were originally disclosed under Item 2.01 of Form 8-K (“Original Form 8-K"), and press release attached in Exhibit 99.1, dated and filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on January 5, 2021.

Item 7.01.Regulation FD Disclosure.

On January 5, 2021, TransDigm Group Incorporated (“TransDigm Group” or the "Company") issued a press release regarding its acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity (“CAC”) described below under Item 8.01. A copy of the press release, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1, is hereby furnished pursuant to Item 7.01.

The information in this Item 8.01 and in Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in filings under the Securities Act of 1933.

Item 8.01.Other Events.

On January 5, 2021, the Company has completed substantially all of its acquisition of CAC. The acquisition of CAC for an aggregate purchase price of $965 million (including tax benefits to be realized by TransDigm Group) was previously announced on November 24, 2020. The acquisition was financed through cash on hand. 

Cobham Aero Connectivity is headquartered in Marlow, UK. CAC is a leading provider of highly engineered antennas and radios for the aerospace end market. The products are primarily proprietary with significant aftermarket content and have a strong presence across major defense platforms as well as select commercial applications. CAC generated approximately $225 million in revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Nearly 60% of CAC’s revenue is derived from international sales and over 70% of CAC’s revenue comes from the aftermarket. CAC has a strong presence across a diverse range of both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. CAC operates from two primary facilities in Marlow, UK and Prescott, Arizona and employs approximately 760 people.

A portion of the CAC acquisition representing approximately 2% of the total purchase price remains subject to Finnish regulatory approval and is expected to close in the coming weeks.
