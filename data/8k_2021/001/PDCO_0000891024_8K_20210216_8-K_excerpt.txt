 Item 1.01  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On February 16, 2021, Patterson Companies, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an amendment, restatement and consolidation of (i) a certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated January 27, 2017 by and among the Company and certain lenders party thereto (the “Existing Credit Agreement”) and (ii) a certain Loan Agreement dated December 20, 2019 by and among the Company and certain lenders party thereto (the “Existing Loan Agreement”). This amended and restated credit agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), dated February 16, 2021, is among the Company, MUFG Bank, Ltd, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed to provide certain senior unsecured credit facilities, consisting of an up to $700,000,000 multicurrency revolving credit facility and a $300,000,000 term loan facility. The Company will use the facilities to (1) refinance and consolidate certain existing indebtedness evidenced by the Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Loan Agreement, (2) pay the fees and expenses incurred therewith, and (3) finance the ongoing working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries.  

Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either (a) a customary Eurocurrency interbank offered rate (the “Eurocurrency Rate”) or (b) a customary base rate (the “Floating Rate”), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins for borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement will be based on the Company’s leverage ratio and range from 1.000% to 2.000% with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.000% and 1.000% with respect to the Floating Rate. The Company also agreed to pay quarterly commitment fees based on the available aggregate loan commitment.  

The Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, provided, however, that the maximum leverage ratio is subject to increase in connection with the consummation of certain types of acquisitions as more particularly set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company is also required to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. The term loans and revolving credit facilities will mature no later than February 16, 2024.  

The above description of the Amended Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and which is incorporated herein by reference.
