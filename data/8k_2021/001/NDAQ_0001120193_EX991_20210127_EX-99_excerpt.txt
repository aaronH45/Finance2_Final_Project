Nasdaq announced the pending acquisition of Verafin in the fourth quarter of 2020, which is expected to expand the company’s anti-financial crime franchise while increasing growth potential.  

New York, NY - Nasdaq, Inc. (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020 and full year 2020.  

2020 net revenues were $2,903 million, an increase of $368 million, or 15%, from $2,535 million in the prior year period. The full year increase in net revenues included a $350 million positive impact from organic growth, a $14 million positive impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and a $4 million positive net impact from acquisitions and divestitures.  

Fourth quarter 2020 net revenues were $788 million, an increase of $142 million, or 22%, from $646 million in the prior year period. Net revenues reflected a $126 million positive impact from organic growth, a $13 million increase from the impact of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and a $3 million increase from the inclusion of revenues from acquisitions.  

“Our record fourth quarter and full year results attest to Nasdaq’s continuing ability to address the needs of our clients in a capital markets environment characterized by elevated trading, strong IPO activity and rising index valuations, made possible by both our resilient, scalable technology and the flexibility our team exhibited in effectively delivering for clients against a pandemic-impacted backdrop,” said Adena Friedman, President and CEO, Nasdaq. “Despite meeting many near-term challenges in 2020, I am incredibly pleased that Nasdaq was also able to accelerate our progress as an advanced technology and analytics provider to the financial industry with our announced acquisition of Verafin, a SaaS technology provider specializing in combating fraud and money laundering. Together with Verafin, we believe that Nasdaq will become a leading provider of anti-financial crime technology, while also raising our long-term organic growth potential.”

GAAP operating expenses were $470 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $84 million from $386 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase primarily reflects higher merger and strategic expense, higher compensation and benefits expense, higher general, administrative and other costs and higher professional fees. GAAP operating expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 also included a $25 million reserve in general, administrative and other costs related to an expected loss on a Market Technology implementation project.  

Non-GAAP operating expenses were $406 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $71 million, or 21%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase reflects a $53 million, or 16%, organic increase over the prior year period. Excluding the reserve related to the Market Technology implementation project of $25 million, the organic increase was $28 million, or 8%. The $28 million increase was primarily driven by performance-linked compensation and other variable expenses resulting from higher than expected revenues during the period. The remainder of the $53 million increase reflects a $12 million increase from the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and a $6 million increase from the impact of acquisitions.  

“As we look back on 2020, Nasdaq continued to demonstrate the resiliency of the business and our balance sheet,” said Michael Ptasznik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Nasdaq. “The company generated over $1 billion of free cash flow, allowing us to continue to reinvest in our business and our people, increase the dividend and execute on our share repurchase plan. During the year, we also refinanced a portion of our debt at favorable interest rates and completed the majority of the funding for the upcoming closing of the acquisition of Verafin, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2021. From a personal standpoint, it has been a privilege to serve this iconic organization over the last five years and work with this outstanding team. As previously announced, Ann Dennison will become the CFO upon my retirement at the end of February, and I know Nasdaq and its stakeholders will be well-served by her considerable capabilities and dedication to the company’s mission.”  

On a GAAP basis, net income in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $224 million, or diluted EPS of $1.34, compared to $202 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2019.  

On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $268 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $215 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2019.  

At December 31, 2020, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,745 million and total debt of $5,541 million, resulting in net debt of $2,796 million. This compares to total debt of $3,387 million and net debt of $3,055 million at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, there was $410 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.  

INITIATING 2021 NON-GAAP EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE5  

The company is initiating its 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1,550 to $1,620 million. The 2021 guidance midpoint reflects a 3% increase due to organic growth, as well as the impacts of foreign exchange rates and merger and acquisition activity, including the Verafin acquisition, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.  

Nasdaq expects its 2021 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 25.0% to 27.0%.

Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) for a given period is the annualized revenues derived from contracted termed subscription contracts. This excludes contracts that are not recurring and are one time in nature. ARR is. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.

U.S. GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.

NON-GAAP INFORMATION  

In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating expenses, and non-GAAP EBITDA, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at the end of this release. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.  

These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.  

We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating expenses to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.  

Foreign exchange impact: In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.

Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, for a given period is the annualized revenue of Market Technology support and SaaS subscription contracts. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts during the reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.
