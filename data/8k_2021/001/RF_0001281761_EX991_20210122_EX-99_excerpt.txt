SUMMARY OF FULL YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER 2020 RESULTS:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]—

* Based on income taxes at an approximate 25% incremental rate. Tax rates associated with leveraged lease terminations are incrementally higher based on their structure. Fourth quarter of 2020 gain associated with the exchange of bank-owned life insurance policies is tax free. 

** Items represent an outsized impact to the quarter or quarterly trends, but are not considered non-GAAP adjustments.

*** CECL was adopted January 1, 2020. Periods prior to January 1, 2020 reflect results under the incurred loss model.

**** Interest income for PPP loans includes estimated funding costs.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, total revenue increased approximately 3 percent on a reported basis and 4 percent on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the third quarter of 2020, reflecting growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. Despite the low interest rate environment, net interest income benefited from the company's significant hedging program, deposit cost reductions, and active cash management strategies, as well as accelerated fee income realized from the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans forgiven during the quarter. Non-interest income benefited from strong capital markets activity and mortgage production, as well as continued improvement in service charges, wealth management, and card and ATM fees. Non-interest expense increased 10 percent during the quarter on a reported basis and 5 percent on an adjusted basis(1), driven by increases in salaries and benefits primarily related to incentives

associated with higher revenue production. The company's fourth quarter efficiency ratio was 58.1 percent on a reported basis and 55.8 percent on an adjusted basis(1). Despite a challenging economic backdrop, 2020 pre-tax pre-provision income(1) increased 11 percent versus 2019, and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income(1) increased 9 percent. 

Compared to the third quarter of 2020, annualized net charge-offs decreased 7 basis points to 0.43 percent of average loans, while total non-performing loans, total delinquencies and business services criticized loans remained relatively stable. The allowance for credit losses decreased 5 basis points to 2.69 percent of total loans, representing 308 percent of non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale. Excluding PPP loans, which are fully government guaranteed, the allowance for credit losses was 2.81 percent(1). The decline in the allowance for credit losses reflects a decline in period-end loan balances, stabilization in the company's economic outlook and improved credit performance, charge-offs previously provided for, as well as the recently announced government stimulus. The overall allowance reduction resulted in a net $38 million benefit to the credit loss provision during the fourth quarter. 

Non-GAAP adjusted items(1) impacting the company's earnings are identified to assist investors in analyzing Regions' operating results on the same basis as that applied by management and provide a basis to predict future performance. Non-GAAP adjusted items(1) in the current quarter reflect, among other items, $26 million of severance charges within salaries and benefits, a $14 million loss on debt extinguishment and a $10 million contribution to the Regions Foundation. Partially offsetting these adjusted items was a $25 million gain on bank-owned life insurance policy exchanges.

Total revenue

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not Meaningful

* These market value adjustments relate to assets held for employee benefits that are offset within salaries and employee benefits expense.

Total revenue of approximately $1.7 billion increased 3 percent on a reported basis and 4 percent on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the third quarter of 2020. Net interest income increased 2 percent, while net interest margin remained unchanged at 3.13 percent. The increase in net interest income is primarily attributable to accelerated fee income recognition associated with PPP loan forgiveness. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, net interest income remained relatively stable as the company's interest rate hedging program continues to add protection from the near-zero short-term interest rate environment. The fourth quarter of 2020 benefited from higher average derivative notional values, reduced deposit costs, and active cash management strategies. The call of Regions Financial Corporation debt in December was modestly accretive to net interest income in the quarter and will provide additional benefit in 2021. Further, securities portfolio additions and liability management strategies that occurred in the third quarter of 2020 provided meaningful linked-quarter benefits. These items offset the net interest income pressure from lower average loan balances and historically low long-term interest rates, which reduced asset yields and increased premium amortization in the securities portfolio. While PPP forgiveness was

accretive to net interest margin, strong deposit growth trends continued in the fourth quarter of 2020, pushing cash balances to record levels, which negatively impacted net interest margin.

Non-interest income increased approximately 4 percent on a reported basis and 7 percent on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the third quarter of 2020. Increases in capital markets income, service charges, card and ATM fees, and wealth management income more than offset declines in mortgage income and market value adjustments on employee benefit assets. Capital markets income increased to a record $110 million during the quarter. Within capital markets, almost every revenue category contributed to the increase. M&A advisory services was the most significant driver as increased activity produced a record quarter. Service charges and card and ATM fees increased 5 and 2 percent, respectively, as customer behavior continued to normalize during the quarter. Wealth management income increased 5 percent reflecting higher sales volumes and improved market values. Although mortgage income decreased from the prior quarter, it was up significantly for the year as 2020 mortgage loan production was more than double 2019 levels. Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets remained positive during the quarter; however, this benefit was offset by a corresponding increase in salaries and benefits. Additionally, bank-owned life insurance increased to $43 million primarily driven by a gain associated with a policy exchange completed during the quarter.

Non-interest expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not Meaningful

Non-interest expense increased 10 percent on a reported basis and 5 percent on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the third quarter of 2020. Salaries and benefits increased, driven primarily by production-based incentives tied to capital markets income and mortgage production as well as elevated severance charges. Excluding the impact of severance charges, salaries and benefits increased 6 percent. Overall, however, base salaries were lower as the company continued to build greater efficiencies through its ongoing continuous improvement process focused on making banking easier for customers and associates. Other expenses increased 24 percent driven by a $10 million contribution to the Regions Foundation. In addition, the company incurred a $14 million loss for the early extinguishment of $1 billion in debt called during the quarter. Offsetting these increases was a 16 percent decrease in outside services driven primarily by lower expenses associated with loan servicing costs for one of the company's exit loan portfolios. 

6

The company's fourth quarter of 2020 efficiency ratio was 58.1 percent on a reported basis and 55.8 percent on an adjusted basis(1). The effective tax rate was 16.5 percent and benefited from a $24 million reduction to the company's liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 

Loans and Leases

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not meaningful.

* Indirect vehicles is an exit portfolio.

** A portion of indirect other consumer is an exit portfolio due to the company's decision not to renew a 3rd party relationship in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Average loans and leases decreased approximately 3 percent compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the company's indirect auto and indirect-other consumer exit portfolios, outstanding PPP loans, and certain commercial loans transferred to held for sale, adjusted average loans and leases(1) decreased approximately 2 percent. Adjusted business lending(1) decreased 4 percent driven by excess liquidity, customers' continued use of capital markets and deleveraging. Commercial loan line utilization levels ended the quarter at approximately 40 percent, below pre-pandemic trends. Adjusted business lending was also impacted by the company's active portfolio management efforts including the additional loan sales during the fourth quarter. Excluding exit portfolios, adjusted consumer lending(1) remained relatively stable as growth in residential first mortgage was partially offset by declines in other categories. 

7

Deposits 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total average deposit balances increased 3 percent to $119.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Average Consumer segment deposit growth was driven by government stimulus payments as well as reduced spending related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Corporate segment deposit growth reflects clients consolidating sources of liquidity. In addition, many corporate clients are building liquidity by focusing on supply chain efficiencies and turnover of receivables. Similarly, Wealth segment deposit growth was driven primarily by clients' desire to hold additional liquidity during the pandemic.

Asset quality[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* CECL was adopted January 1, 2020. Periods prior to January 1, 2020 reflect results under the incurred loss model. Upon adoption of CECL, the provision for credit losses is the sum of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded credit commitments. Prior to the adoption of CECL, the provision for unfunded commitments was included in other non-interest expense.

** Excludes guaranteed residential first mortgages that are 90+ days past due and still accruing. 

*** Business services represents the combined total of commercial and investor real estate loans.

A decline in period-end loan balances, the impact of net charge-offs previously provided for, stabilization in the economic outlook, as well as recently announced government stimulus resulted in a net $38 million benefit to the credit loss provision during the fourth quarter of 2020. The credit loss provision benefit was also impacted by allowance adjustments related to loans sold or moved to held for sale during the quarter. The resulting allowance for credit losses is equal to 2.69 percent of total loans and 308 percent of total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale. Excluding PPP loans, which are fully government guaranteed, the allowance for credit losses amounted to 2.81 percent(1) of total loans. Annualized net charge-offs decreased 7 basis points to 43 basis points of average loans. The decrease reflects lower losses primarily within commercial loan portfolios and relatively stable consumer net charge-offs. Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, total delinquencies, and total business services criticized loans remained relatively stable.

Capital and liquidity[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Tangible common book value per share includes the impact of quarterly earnings and changes to market value adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income, as well as continued capital returns.

Regions maintains a solid capital position as estimated capital ratios remain well above current regulatory requirements. The Tier 1(2) and Common Equity Tier 1(2) ratios were estimated at 11.4 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively, at quarter-end. 

The company declared $148 million in dividends to common shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2020. Consistent with its previous announcement to temporarily suspend share repurchases through year-end 2020, the company did not repurchase shares in the quarter. 

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve released the results of its updated Supervisory Stress Test and indicated that Regions met or exceeded all minimum capital levels under the provided scenarios. Regions' robust capital planning process is designed to ensure efficient use of capital and to support lending activities and focus on appropriate shareholder returns. The company's current operating range for Common Equity Tier 1 capital is between 9.5 percent and 10.0 percent. Given the continued uncertainty associated with the ongoing pandemic, the company intends to maintain capital at the higher end of the range.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

Management uses pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP) and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP), as well as the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the fee income ratio. Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) and adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP) are used to determine adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) as a percentage of total loans is an important ratio, especially during periods of economic stress. Management believes this ratio provides investors with meaningful additional information about credit loss allowance levels when the impact of SBA's Paycheck Protection Program loans, which are fully backed by the U.S. government, and any related allowance are excluded from total loans and total allowance which are the denominator and numerator, respectively, used in the ACL ratio. This adjusted ACL ratio represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

Tangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.

Management and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentation to investors of company performance
