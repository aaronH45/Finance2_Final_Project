Fiscal 2022 full year guidance

The following guidance reflects the company’s expectations for fiscal year 2022 and is provided on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation, the timing of divestitures and the changes in fair value on the Company’s equity investments. Additionally, the guidance assumes we complete the sale of our business in Japan near the beginning of fiscal 2022. Assumptions in the guidance are dependent upon the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 health crisis globally, timing and effectiveness of global vaccines, the scale and duration of economic stimulus, employment trends and consumer confidence.

U.S. comparable sales results1

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs and it is important to review in conjunction with the Company’s financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Comparable sales excluding fuel is also an important, separate metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs without considering fuel, which is volatile and unpredictable. Other companies in our industry may calculate comparable sales differently, limiting the comparability of the metric.

1 Fiscal 2021 comparable sales are for the 13-week and 52-week periods ended January 29, 2021 compared to the 13-week and 52-week periods ended January 31, 2020. As the retail sales calendar for the year ended January 31, 2020 included 53 weeks, fiscal 2020 comparable sales are for the 14-week and 53-week periods ended January 31, 2020 compared to the 14-week and 53-week periods ended February 1, 2019.

Reconciliations of and Other Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(Unaudited)

The following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP financial information presented in the press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies.

Constant Currency 

In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.

Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. 

The table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues, net sales and operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

Adjusted operating income

Adjusted operating income is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain charges included in operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that adjusted operating income is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, adjusted operating income affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance as compared with that of the prior year. 

When we refer to adjusted operating income in constant currency this means adjusted operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The tables below reflect the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income in constant currency for the three months and fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The charge relates to amounts which were not allocated to an operating segment and recorded in Corporate and support. 

2 Fiscal 2021 includes a business restructuring charge resulting from changes to Walmart U.S. support teams to better support its omni-channel strategy recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Business restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 include (1) $399 million of non-cash impairment charges to write down of certain eCommerce assets in Walmart U.S. and $51 million in related severance costs; and (2) $96 million of non-cash impairment charges related to strategic business decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in Walmart International. Additionally, for fiscal 2020, business restructuring charges includes $293 million in non-cash impairment charges in the third quarter for the Jabong.com trade name.

Free Cash Flow

We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $36.1 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, which increased when compared to $25.3 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments. We generated free cash flow of $25.8 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, which increased when compared to $14.6 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in decreased capital expenditures. 

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company’s financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. 

Additionally, Walmart’s definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 “Net cash used in investing activities” includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.

Adjusted EPS

Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year.

We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the Company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the respective market’s operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the realized and unrealized gains and losses related to those equity investments. 

We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three months and fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 by adjusting EPS for the following: 

1.the loss on sale of our operations in Japan and the U.K. which were determined to be held for sale as of January 31, 2021 and our operations in Walmart Argentina which were held for sale as of October 31, 2020 and subsequently divested in November 2020; 

2.unrealized and realized gains and losses on the Company’s equity investments; 

3.discrete tax items;

4.a charge related to officer compensation; and

5.a business restructuring charge resulting from changes to Walmart support teams to better support the Walmart U.S. omni-channel support strategy in the quarter ended July 31, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Calculated based on nature of item, including any realizable deductions, and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions. Minimal realizable tax benefit was provided in connection with the loss on certain international operations held for sale or sold, as well as the officer compensation charge. 

2 The reported effective tax rate was (238.6%) and 33.3% for the three months and fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, respectively. Adjusted for the above items, the effective tax rate was 22.0% and 24.3% for the three months and fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, respectively. 

3 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of our noncontrolling interests. 

4 Adjusted EPS for the three months ended January 31, 2021 was calculated using weighted average shares outstanding of 2,844 million, which includes the dilutive impact of share-based payment awards.

5 Quarterly adjustments or adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD adjustments or YTD adjusted EPS due to rounding. 

15

 As previously disclosed in our fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 press release, we have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three months and fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 by adjusting EPS for the following: (1) unrealized gains and losses on the company’s equity investment in JD.com; (2) a tax benefit on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities as a result of an income tax rate reduction in India; (3) certain income tax matters; and (4) certain business restructuring charges which primarily includes non-cash impairment charges on certain trade names and other long-lived assets.
