•Full year net cash from operating activities of $833 million 

Providence, Rhode Island – January 27, 2021 – Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) today reported fourth quarter 2020 net income of $1.03 per share. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure that is defined and reconciled to GAAP in an attachment to this release, was $1.06 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $1.11 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income for 2020 excludes $23 million of pre-tax special charges ($0.07 per share, after-tax) and a one-time favorable tax benefit related to the sale of TRU Canada ($0.04 per share). 

Full-year 2020 net income was $1.35 per share. Full-year 2020 adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $2.07 per share, down from $3.74 in 2019.

“Textron closed out 2020 with a solid performance across all our manufacturing segments,” said Textron Chairman and CEO Scott C. Donnelly. “At Systems, Industrial and Bell, we saw margin improvements and at Aviation, we delivered 61 jets with continued order momentum.”

Cash Flow

Net cash provided by operating activities of the manufacturing group for the full year was $833 million, compared to $960 million last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions, a non-GAAP measure that is defined and reconciled to GAAP in an attachment to this release, was $596 million compared to $642 million last year.

After reactivating the share repurchase program in the quarter, Textron returned $129 million to shareholders through repurchases. 

Outlook

Textron is forecasting 2021 revenues of approximately $12.5 billion, up from $11.7 billion in 2020. Textron expects full-year 2021 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.64 to $2.88, or $2.70 to $2.90 on an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), which is reconciled to GAAP in an attachment to this release. 

The company is estimating net cash provided by operating activities of the manufacturing group will be between $950 million and $1,050 million and manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions (a non-GAAP measure) will be between $600 million and $700 million, with planned pension contributions of about $50 million.

Donnelly continued, “Our outlook reflects continued improvement in our end-markets and our ongoing investments in new products and programs to drive earnings growth and margin expansion.”

Fourth Quarter Segment Results

Textron Aviation

Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.6 billion were down $169 million, primarily due to lower Citation jet volume and lower aftermarket volume. 

Textron Aviation delivered 61 jets, down from 71 last year, and 61 commercial turboprops, up from 59 last year.

Segment profit was $108 million down from $134 million a year ago, primarily due to the impact from lower volume and mix.

Textron Aviation backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion.

Bell

Bell revenues were $871 million down from $961 million last year, on lower military revenues and commercial volume. 

Bell delivered 57 commercial helicopters in the quarter, down from 76 last year.

Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, largely on the lower volume partially offset by a favorable impact from performance, primarily reflecting higher favorable program adjustments.

Bell backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $5.3 billion. 

Textron Systems 

Revenues at Textron Systems were $357 million, down from $399 million last year, primarily due to lower volume in the TRU Simulation + Training business. 

Segment profit of $49 million was up from $33 million last year, primarily due to the favorable impact from performance.

Textron Systems’ backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $2.6 billion.

Industrial

Industrial revenues were $866 million, a decrease of $61 million from last year, primarily related to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within the Specialized Vehicles product line. 

Segment profit was $55 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a favorable impact from pricing and inflation, and favorable performance, partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix. 

Finance

Finance segment revenues in the quarter were $13 million, and profit was $2 million.

Revenues by Segment and Reconciliation of Segment Profit to Net Income (Continued)

(a)In 2020, we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses through headcount reductions, facility consolidations and other actions in response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The restructuring plan primarily impacts the TRU Simulation + Training (TRU) business within the Textron Systems segment and the Industrial and Textron Aviation segments. In connection with this plan, special charges for the three and twelve months ended January 2, 2021, includes severance and related costs of $17 million and $73 million, respectively, asset impairment charges of $5 million and $22 million, respectively, and contract termination and other facility closing costs of $1 million and $13 million, respectively. Special charges for the twelve months ended January 2, 2021 also includes the impairment of indefinite-lived trade name intangible assets totaling $32 million in the Textron Aviation segment and $7 million in the Industrial segment resulting from changes in valuation assumptions related to the economic and business disruptions caused by the pandemic. In 2019, we recorded special charges of $72 million under a restructuring plan, principally impacting the Industrial and Textron Aviation segments.

(b)In connection with the restructuring plan described above, we ceased manufacturing at TRU's facility in Montreal, Canada, resulting in the production suspension of our commercial air transport simulators. As a result of this action and market conditions, we recorded a $55 million charge in the second quarter of 2020 to write-down the related inventory to its net realizable value. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we reached a definitive agreement to sell TRU Simulation + Training Canada Inc. which resulted in the recognition of an $8 million tax benefit.

(c)Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" attached to this release.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures may be useful for period-over-period comparisons of underlying business trends and our ongoing business performance, however, they should be used in conjunction with GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define similarly named measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. We utilize the following definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this release and have provided a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP amounts for each measure:

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share

Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude special charges, net of tax, and an inventory charge, net of tax and a tax benefit both related to TRU Simulation + Training Canada Inc. (TRU Canada) in connection with the restructuring plan and disposition of this company. We consider items recorded in special charges, such as enterprise-wide restructuring, certain asset impairment charges, and acquisition-related restructuring, integration and transaction costs, to be of a non-recurring nature that is not indicative of ongoing operations. At TRU Canada, the inventory charge is excluded as it relates to the write-down of inventory in connection with an action taken under the restructuring plan. Due to the substantial decline in demand and order cancellations for flight simulators resulting from the impact of the pandemic on the commercial air transportation business, we ceased manufacturing at TRU Canada’s Montreal facility, resulting in the production suspension of its commercial air transport simulators. As a result of this action and market conditions, the related inventory was written down to its net realizable value. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we reached a definitive agreement to sell TRU Canada, which resulted in the recognition of an $8 million tax benefit. We believe this inventory charge and tax benefit are of a non-recurring nature and are not indicative of ongoing operations.

(a)Special charges, net of tax includes costs we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring plan initiated in 2020. 

(b)Gain on disposition, net of tax includes the estimated after-tax gain on the sale of TRU Canada.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Continued)

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Manufacturing Cash Flow Before Pension Contributions

Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions adjusts net cash from operating activities (GAAP) for the following:

•Deducts capital expenditures and includes proceeds from an insurance recovery and the sale of property, plant and equipment to arrive at the net capital investment required to support ongoing manufacturing operations;

•Excludes dividends received from Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and capital contributions to TFC provided under the Support Agreement and debt agreements as these cash flows are not representative of manufacturing operations;

•Adds back pension contributions as we consider our pension obligations to be debt-like liabilities. Additionally, these contributions can fluctuate significantly from period to period and we believe that they are not representative of cash used by our manufacturing operations during the period;

•Excludes taxes paid related to the gain realized in 2018 on the Tools and Test business disposition. We have made this adjustment to the non-GAAP measure because we believe this use of cash is not representative of cash used by our manufacturing operations.

While we believe this measure provides a focus on cash generated from manufacturing operations, before pension contributions, and may be used as an additional relevant measure of liquidity, it does not necessarily provide the amount available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations that are not deducted from the measure.
