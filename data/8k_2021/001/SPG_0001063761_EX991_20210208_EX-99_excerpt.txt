 SIMON PROPERTY GROUP REPORTS  

 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2020 RESULTS   

 INDIANAPOLIS, February 8, 2021 – Simon, a global leader in the ownership of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, today reported results for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2020.   

“2020 was a difficult year for all those affected by COVID-19, including our Company,” said David Simon, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. “We feel confident we have turned the corner, and we expect growth in earnings and cash flow in 2021.”  

“Even with the unprecedented operating environment over the past year, we:  

•

generated over $2.3 billion in operating cash flow;  

​ 

•

acquired an 80% interest in The Taubman Realty Group;  

​ 

•

made strategic investments in widely recognized retail brands at attractive valuations and have already made significant progress in repositioning these brands and increasing their operating cash flow;  

​ 

•

raised over $13 billion in the debt and equity markets;  

​ 

•

opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others and completed three domestic redevelopments;  

​ 

•

granted approximately $400 million in tenant rent abatements to support small and local businesses, regional entrepreneurs and restauranteurs;  

​ 

•

paid nearly $700 million in real estate taxes (an increase from 2019) despite losing approximately 13,500 shopping days in our domestic portfolio during the year as a result of the restrictive governmental orders placed on our retail real estate and  

​ 

•

returned more than $2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends paid.”  

​

 EARNINGS RELEASE  

 Results for the Year   

•

Net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.109 billion, or $3.59 per diluted share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Results for 2020 include non-cash impairment charges, partially offset by a gain on sale, of $115.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share.  

​ 

•

Funds From Operations (“FFO”) was $3.237 billion, or $9.11 per diluted share for the year ended 2020. FFO for the year ended 2020 was negatively impacted by $2.67 per diluted share primarily due to reduced revenues from the Company’s domestic and international operations caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives.  

​ 

•

Portfolio net operating income (“NOI”) for the full year 2020 declined 17.1%. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to reduced revenues from tenant rent abatements, higher uncollectible rents, lower sales-based rents and a reduction in ancillary property income, including Simon Brand Ventures sponsorship income, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives. The Company did not amortize any rent abatements; instead, abatements were expensed in the period granted.  

​ 

 Results for the Quarter   

•

Net income attributable to common stockholders was $271.5 million, or $0.86 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2020. The current year period includes a non-cash impairment charge, partially offset by a gain on sale, of $16.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.  

​ 

•

FFO was $786.6 million, or $2.17 per diluted share. FFO in the current year period was negatively impacted by $0.95 primarily due to reduced revenues from the Company’s domestic and international operations caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives.  

​ 

•

Portfolio NOI for the three months ended December 31, 2020 declined 23.9%.  

​ 

 U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets Operating Statistics   

•

Occupancy was 91.3% at December 31, 2020.  

​ 

•

Base minimum rent per square foot was $55.80 at December 31, 2020, an increase of 2.2% year-over-year.

 Business Update   

As of February 5, 2021, the Company has collected from its U.S. retail portfolio, 90% of its net billed rents for the second, third and fourth quarters, combined.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Amounts are presented on a gross basis, not at the Company’s share. U.S. managed portfolio gross contractual rents do not include any prior period deferrals or sales-based rents. Amounts above relate to the contractual rents in the stated periods. Abatements reduced Lease Income in the period they were granted or agreed.  

 Acquisition of Taubman Centers, Inc.   

In December, the Company completed its acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in The Taubman Realty Group (“TRG”). Under the terms of the transaction, Simon, through its operating partnership, Simon Property Group, L.P., acquired all of Taubman Centers, Inc. (“TCO”) common stock for $43.00 per share in cash, and the Taubman family sold approximately one-third of its ownership interest at the transaction price and remains a 20% partner in TRG.  

Total consideration for the acquisition, including the redemption of TCO’s 6.5% Series J Cumulative Preferred Shares and its 6.25% Series K Cumulative Preferred Shares, was approximately $3.45 billion and was funded with existing liquidity, including proceeds from Simon’s issuance of 22,137,500 shares of its common stock which was completed in November 2020.  

 Capital Markets and Balance Sheet Liquidity   

During the fourth quarter, the Company completed a public offering of 22,137,500 shares of its common stock. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.56 billion.  

Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company completed a two tranche senior notes offering totaling $1.5 billion. Combined, the two new issues of senior notes had a weighted average term of 8.4 years and a weighted average coupon rate of 1.96%.  

As of December 31, 2020, Simon had more than $8.2 billion of liquidity consisting of $1.5 billion of cash on hand, including its share of joint venture cash, and $6.7 billion of available capacity under its revolving credit facilities, net of $623 million outstanding under its U.S. commercial paper program.

 Dividends   

The Company paid its fourth quarter 2020 common stock dividend of $1.30 per share, in cash, on January 22, 2021. Simon’s Board of Directors will declare a common stock cash dividend for the first quarter of 2021 on or before March 31, 2021.  

Simon’s Board of Directors declared the quarterly dividend on its 8 3/8% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (NYSE: SPGPrJ) of $1.046875 per share, payable on March 31, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 17, 2021.  

 2021 Guidance   

The Company currently estimates net income to be within a range of $4.60 to $4.85 per diluted share and that FFO will be within a range of $9.50 to $9.75 per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2021. This guidance range assumes no further government mandated shutdowns of the Company’s domestic retail properties.  

The following table provides the reconciliation for the expected range of estimated net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share to estimated FFO per diluted share:

 EARNINGS RELEASE  

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures   

This press release includes FFO, FFO per share and portfolio Net Operating Income growth which are financial performance measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this press release and in Simon’s supplemental information for the quarter. FFO and Net Operating Income growth are financial performance measures widely used in the REIT industry. Our definitions of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.  

 Forward-Looking Statements   

Certain statements made in this press release may be deemed “forward — looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward — looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that the Company’s actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward — looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: uncertainties regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental restrictions intended to prevent its spread on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets, satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our stockholders; changes in economic and market conditions that may adversely affect the general retail environment; the potential loss of anchor stores or major tenants; the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; the intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry, including e-commerce; an increase in vacant space at our properties; the inability to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties on favorable terms; our international activities subjecting us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations, including changes in foreign exchange rates; risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment, expansion, leasing and management of properties; general risks related to real estate investments, including the illiquidity of real estate investments; the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our future operations, including covenants in the governing agreements that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate freely; any disruption in the financial markets that may adversely affect our ability to access capital for growth and satisfy our ongoing debt service requirements; any change in our credit rating; changes in market rates of interest; the transition of LIBOR to an alternative reference rate; our continued ability to maintain our status as a REIT; changes in tax laws or regulations that result in adverse tax consequences; risks relating to our joint venture properties, including guarantees of certain joint venture indebtedness; environmental liabilities; natural disasters; the availability of comprehensive insurance coverage; the potential for terrorist activities; security breaches that could compromise our information technology or infrastructure; and the loss of key management personnel. The Company discusses these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading “Risk Factors” in its annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC. The Company may update that discussion in subsequent other periodic reports, but except as required by law, the Company undertakes no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.

 Footnotes to Unaudited Financial Information   

 Notes:   

(A)

Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the related partnerships and joint ventures shown therein. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related assets.  

​ 

(B)

The Unaudited Joint Venture Combined Statements of Operations do not include any operations or our share of net income or excess investment amortization related to our investments in Klépierre and TRG. Amounts included in Footnote D below exclude our share of related activity for our investments in Klépierre and TRG. For further information on Klépierre, reference should be made to financial information in Klépierre’s public filings and additional discussion and analysis in our Form 10-K.  

​ 

(C)

This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP, including FFO and FFO per share. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.  

​ 

We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) Funds From Operations White Paper — 2018 Restatement. Our main business includes acquiring, owning, operating, developing, and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of real estate. Gains and losses of assets incidental to our main business are included in FFO. We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sale, disposal or property insurance recoveries of, or any impairment related to, depreciable retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  

(D)

Includes our share of:  

​ 

  –  

(Losses) gains on land sales of ($0.1) million and $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $8.0 million and $17.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  

​ 

  –  

Straight-line adjustments (decreased) increased income by ($19.6) million and $24.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and ($23.9) million and $90.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  

​ 

  –  

Amortization of fair market value of leases from acquisitions increased income by $1.7 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $5.2 million and $5.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS​  

 NON-GAAP PRO-RATA FINANCIAL INFORMATION   

The following pro-rata financial information is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP pro-rata financial information aggregates our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in our property portfolio that we do not wholly own. The amounts in the column labeled “Our Share of Joint Ventures” were derived on a property-by-property or entity-by-entity basis by applying to each line item the ownership percentage interest used to arrive at our share of the net operations for the period consistent with the application of the equity method of accounting to each of our unconsolidated joint ventures. A similar calculation was performed for the amounts in the column labeled “Noncontrolling Interests,” which represents the share of consolidated assets and net income or loss attributable to any noncontrolling interest.  

We do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the presentations of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items. The operating agreements of the unconsolidated joint ventures generally provide that partners may receive cash distributions (1) to the extent there is available cash from operations, (2) upon a capital event, such as a refinancing or sale or (3) upon liquidation of the venture. The amount of cash each partner receives is based upon specific provisions of each operating agreement and varies depending on factors including the amount of capital contributed by each partner and whether any contributions are entitled to priority distributions. Upon liquidation of the joint venture and after all liabilities, priority distributions and initial equity contributions have been repaid, the partners generally would be entitled to any residual cash remaining based on their respective legal ownership percentages.  

We provide pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our unconsolidated joint ventures when read in conjunction with the Company’s reported results under GAAP. The presentation of pro-rata financial information has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations include:  

•

The amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; and  

​ 

•

Other companies in our industry may calculate their pro-rata interest differently than we do, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure.  

​ 

Because of these limitations, the pro-rata financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using the pro-rata financial information only supplementally.
