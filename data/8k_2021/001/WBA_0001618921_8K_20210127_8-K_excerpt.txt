Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (the “Company”) held on January 28, 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The Company’s Board of Directors approved the Plan in October 2020, subject to stockholder approval. 

The Plan provides for a variety of equity and cash-based awards as a tool for the Company to attract, retain, motivate, and reward executives and other employees of the Company or its affiliates, as well as non-employee directors; to provide for equitable and competitive compensation opportunities, including deferral opportunities, to encourage long-term service; to recognize individual contributions and reward achievement of Company goals; and promote the creation of long-term value for stockholders by closely aligning the interests of participants with those of stockholders. 

The Plan replaces the Company’s 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “Former Plan”). As of the effective date of the Plan, no further grants may be made under the Former Plan and shares that were available for issuance under the Former Plan and not subject to outstanding awards became available for issuance (in addition to 65 million newly authorized shares) under the Plan. In addition, subject to and in accordance with the Plan, shares that are subject to outstanding awards under the Plan or Former Plan that are subsequently cancelled, expired, forfeited, settled in cash or are otherwise terminated or settled without delivery of the full number of shares subject to such award also become available for awards under the Plan. 

A more detailed description of the Plan was set forth in the Company’s Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 8, 2020 under the heading “Proposal 4 – Approval of the new 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan” and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. 

The general forms of the Performance Share Award agreement, the Stock Option Award agreement and the Restricted Stock Unit Award agreement to be used under the Plan are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively. 

On January 27, 2021, the Compensation and Leadership Performance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Former Plan that revises certain provisions relating to the treatment of fractional shares, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.5 and incorporated herein by reference.
