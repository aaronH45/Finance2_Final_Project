Item 8.01 Other Events.

On January 19, 2021, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the “Company”) announced that it had reached agreement to settle all class claims related to the previously disclosed litigation captioned In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation (the “Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation”). Settlement terms were reached with the putative Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class, the putative Commercial and Institutional Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class and the putative End-User Plaintiff Class (collectively, the “Classes”).

Under the terms of the settlements, the Company has agreed to pay the Classes an aggregate amount of $221.5 million, which will be reflected in the Company’s first quarter 2021 financial statements, in settlement of all outstanding claims brought by the Classes. These settlements are subject to the execution of long-form settlement agreements with the respective parties and court approval thereof, and do not settle claims made by plaintiffs who opted out of the Classes in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation. While the Company does not admit any liability as part of the settlements, it believes that the settlements were in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders in order to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation.
