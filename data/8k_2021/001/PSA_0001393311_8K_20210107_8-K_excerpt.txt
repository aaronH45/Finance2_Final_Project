Regulation FD Disclosure.  

Public Storage announced today the following operating update for the three months ended December 31, 2020. 

Same Store Facilities Operating Update (a)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Please see “Analysis of Same Store Revenue” under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our September 30, 2020 Form 10-Q for further information with respect to the various factors we see affecting our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020.  

   (a)  

The Same Store Facilities at December 31, 2020 consist of 2,221 facilities (143.7 million net rentable square feet) that have been owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2018. These facilities represented approximately 82% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2020.  

   (b)  

Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis, such as late charges and administrative fees, does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts, and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.
