Operating Expenses  

Fourth Quarter       

Operating expenses were $5.91 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, 19% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and 5% lower than the third quarter of 2020. 

The decrease in operating expenses compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and lower compensation and benefits expenses. In addition, travel and entertainment expenses (included in market development expenses) and occupancy-related expenses were lower. These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher charitable contributions (included in other expenses), significantly higher transaction based expenses (reflecting an increase in activity levels) and higher technology expenses. 

Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $24 million compared with $1.09 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019.
