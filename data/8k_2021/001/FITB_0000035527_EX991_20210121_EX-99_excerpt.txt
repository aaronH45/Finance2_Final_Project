CEO Commentary

"Fifth Third delivered strong financial performance in 2020 despite the challenging operating environment brought on by the pandemic. We also delivered strong fourth quarter results, improving return metrics, and solid credit quality compared to the prior quarter. Our robust capital and liquidity levels further improved this quarter, indicative of our balance sheet strength which will serve us well this year and beyond.

Focused execution on our key strategic priorities and our disciplined approach to credit risk management continue to drive strong financial results while also generating improved outcomes for customers. As we recently announced, we have taken actions to drive efficiencies and improve the long-term profitability of the bank as we navigate the interest rate environment by streamlining our operations, including divesting less profitable businesses, while still investing in areas of growth and profitability.

We remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value for shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top performing regional bank.

I am very proud of the way our employees have continually risen to the occasion in support of our customers and each other during these challenging times in our society. Fifth Third continues to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities, and we remain committed to equality, equity, and inclusion for all.”

Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ®: FITB) today reported fourth quarter 2020 net income of $604 million compared to net income of $581 million in the prior quarter and $734 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income available to common shareholders in the current quarter was $569 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to $562 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the prior quarter and $701 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Reported full year 2020 net income was $1.4 billion compared to full year 2019 net income of $2.5 billion. Full year 2020 net income available to common shareholders was $1.3 billion, or $1.83 per diluted share, compared to 2019 full year net income available to common shareholders of $2.4 billion, or $3.33 per diluted share.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compared to the prior quarter, NII increased $12 million, or 1%, reflecting lower core deposit and wholesale borrowing costs, approximately $10 million in accelerated PPP fees recognized upon loan forgiveness, and elevated investment portfolio prepayment penalty proceeds, partially offset by the impact of lower commercial loan balances and a decline in mortgage rates. Compared to the prior quarter, NIM was stable. Lower core deposit costs, accelerated PPP fees recognized upon loan forgiveness, elevated investment portfolio prepayment penalty proceeds, and lower CD balances were offset by the unfavorable impact of increased cash balances. Fourth quarter 2020 NIM was negatively impacted by approximately 56 bps due to the impact of PPP and excess liquidity compared to historical balances, compared to 48 bps in the prior quarter.

Compared to the year-ago quarter, NII decreased $47 million, or 4%, primarily reflecting lower market rates and lower commercial loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit costs, the favorable impact of previously executed cash flow hedges, and growth from PPP loans. Compared to the year-ago quarter, NIM decreased 69 bps, primarily reflecting the impact of elevated cash balances and lower market rates, partially offset by benefits from lower core deposit and wholesale borrowing costs, as well as the favorable impact of previously executed cash flow hedges.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Reported noninterest income increased $65 million, or 9%, from the prior quarter, and decreased $248 million, or 24%, from the year-ago quarter. The reported results reflect the impact of certain items in the table below. Reported results in the current quarter include securities gains, including approximately $13 million attributable to mark-to-market impacts related to non-qualified deferred compensation assets (more than offset by $19 million in noninterest expense).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest income excluding certain items increased $111 million, or 16%. Compared to the year-ago quarter, noninterest income excluding certain items increased $90 million, or 12%. 

Compared to the prior quarter, service charges on deposits increased $2 million, or 1%, reflecting an increase in consumer deposit fees. Commercial banking revenue increased $16 million, or 13%, primarily driven by increases in M&A advisory fees and loan syndication revenue, partially offset by lower corporate bond fees. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $51 million, or 67%, primarily driven by lower origination fees and gains on loan sales resulting from a decrease in origination volumes, margin compression, the decision to retain certain mortgages originated during the quarter, and an unfavorable MSR net valuation adjustment. Current quarter mortgage originations of $3.9 billion decreased 13% compared to the prior quarter. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $1 million, or 1%, primarily driven by higher personal asset management revenue and brokerage fees, partially offset by lower institutional trust fees. Card and processing revenue was flat, as an increase in credit transaction volume was offset by higher rewards. Leasing business revenue decreased $8 million, or 10%, primarily driven by a seasonal decrease in business solutions revenue. Other noninterest income results were driven by the recognition of tax receivable agreement revenue of $74 million as well as private equity income. 

4

Compared to the year-ago quarter, service charges on deposits decreased $3 million, or 2%, as a decline in consumer deposit fees was partially offset by an increase in commercial deposit fees. Commercial banking revenue increased $14 million, or 11%, reflecting an increase in M&A advisory fees and corporate bond fees, partially offset by lower loan syndication revenue. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $48 million, or 66%, primarily driven by an unfavorable MSR net valuation adjustment and an increase in MSR decay resulting from higher prepayment speeds. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $4 million, or 3%, primarily driven by higher personal asset management revenue and brokerage fees. Card and processing revenue decreased by $3 million, or 3%, primarily reflecting lower commercial and consumer card spend volumes, partially offset by lower rewards. Leasing business revenue decreased $2 million, or 3%, primarily reflecting lower operating lease revenue. Other noninterest income results were driven by the recognition of tax receivable agreement revenue as well as private equity income. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Reported noninterest expense increased $75 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter, and increased $76 million, or 7%, from the year-ago quarter. The reported results reflect the impact of certain items in the table below. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense excluding certain items increased $41 million, or 4%, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense reflecting strong business performance and the mark-to-market impacts of approximately $19 million in non-qualified deferred compensation expense in the current quarter compared to a $7 million expense in the prior quarter, partially offset by lower other noninterest expense. Compared to the year-ago quarter, noninterest expense excluding certain items increased $38 million, or 3%, primarily reflecting an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by lower marketing expense and other noninterest expense.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compared to the prior quarter, total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 4%, primarily driven by a decline in C&I and residential mortgage balances, partially offset by an increase in indirect secured consumer loans (predominantly indirect automobile). Average commercial portfolio loans and leases decreased 5%, reflecting lower C&I revolving line of credit utilization and term loan balances, as well as a decline in commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by growth in commercial construction balances. Average consumer portfolio loans decreased 1%, as lower residential mortgage and home equity balances were partially offset by higher indirect secured consumer loans. 

Compared to the year-ago quarter, total average portfolio loans and leases were flat as growth in both indirect secured consumer loans and commercial construction loans were offset by declines in home equity and residential mortgage balances, as well as lower C&I balances impacted by lower revolving line of credit utilization. Average commercial portfolio loans and leases decreased 1%, due to a decline in C&I loan balances reflecting lower revolving line of credit utilization, and the expected decline in commercial leases, partially offset by PPP loans and growth in commercial construction loans. Average consumer portfolio loans were flat, as higher indirect secured consumer loans were offset by lower home equity, residential mortgage balances, and credit card balances.

Total period-end commercial portfolio loans and leases of $69 billion decreased $2 billion, or 3%, from the prior quarter, and decreased $1 billion, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter. The sequential decline reflected lower C&I revolving line of credit utilization and term loan balances in the current quarter. Period-end commercial revolving line utilization was 32%, compared to 33% in the prior quarter and 36% in the year-ago quarter. Period-end consumer portfolio loans were relatively stable compared to the third quarter, as continued growth in indirect secured consumer loans was partially offset by declines in residential mortgage and home equity balances. Period-end loans and leases held for sale increased $2.2 billion sequentially, primarily attributable to the purchase of $2.1 billion in government guaranteed loans related to GNMA early buyouts associated with CARES Act forbearance plans.

Average available-for-sale debt and other securities of $35.0 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter and 1% compared to the year-ago quarter.

Average commercial transaction deposits increased 3% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 2%.

Compared to the year-ago quarter, average core deposits increased 28%, reflecting double-digit growth in all deposit captions except other time and foreign office deposits. Average commercial transaction deposits increased 49% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 16%. 

The period end loan-to-core deposit ratio was 69% in the current quarter, compared to 72% in the prior quarter and 89% in the year-ago quarter. Excluding PPP loans of $4.8 billion in the current quarter and $5.2 billion in the prior quarter, the period end loan-to-core deposit ratio was 66% in the current quarter, compared to 69% in the prior quarter. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compared to the prior quarter, average wholesale funding decreased 14%, driven by lower jumbo CD balances, as well as the full-quarter impact of debt redemption that occurred at the end of the third quarter. Compared to the year-ago quarter, average wholesale funding decreased 13%, reflecting decreases in jumbo CD balances and federal funds borrowings.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Nonperforming portfolio loans and leases were $834 million in the current quarter, with the resulting NPL ratio of 0.77%. Compared to the prior quarter, NPLs decreased $57 million with the NPL ratio decreasing 3 bps. Compared to the year-ago quarter, NPLs increased $216 million with the NPL ratio increasing 21 bps.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Capital ratios remained strong this quarter. The CET1 capital ratio was 10.34%, the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.11% excluding AOCI, and 8.29% including AOCI. The Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 11.83%, the Total risk-based capital ratio was 15.08%, and the Tier I leverage ratio was 8.49%. Certain capital ratios, including the Tier I leverage ratio, continued to be impacted by the increase in assets since the onset of the pandemic, predominantly from growth in 0% risk-weighted assets resulting from an increase in interest-bearing cash as well as PPP loans. 

On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced results of the second round of stress tests under the 2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, and stated that it is extending the time period for notifying banks whether Stress Capital Buffer requirements will be recalculated through March 31, 2021. Additionally, the Federal Reserve announced it is authorizing CCAR banks to initiate share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021, subject to payout limits such that capital distributions consisting of common dividends and share repurchases cannot exceed average net income over the prior four quarters. Based on the four quarters of net income and common dividends ended the fourth quarter of 2020, Fifth Third has the capacity to execute up to approximately $180 million in share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021 (which includes approximately $20 million in repurchases to offset employee compensation issuances), which may be completed through an accelerated share repurchase agreement or open market repurchases.

Tax Rate

The effective tax rate was 19.1% compared with 22.1% in the prior quarter and 22.0% in the year-ago quarter. The tax rate in the current quarter reflected favorable one-time state tax adjustments of $13 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to GAAP measures, management considers various non-GAAP measures when evaluating the performance of the business, including: “net interest income (FTE),” “interest income (FTE),” “net interest margin (FTE),” “net interest rate spread (FTE),” “income before income taxes (FTE),” “tangible net income available to common shareholders,” “average tangible common equity,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “tangible common equity (excluding AOCI),” “tangible common equity (including AOCI),” “tangible equity,” “tangible book value per share,” “adjusted noninterest income,” “noninterest income excluding certain items,” “adjusted noninterest expense,” “noninterest expense excluding certain items,” “pre-provision net revenue,” “adjusted efficiency ratio,” “adjusted return on average common equity,” “adjusted return on average tangible common equity,” “adjusted return on average tangible common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income,” “adjusted net interest margin,” “adjusted pre-provision net revenue,” “adjusted return on average assets,” “efficiency ratio (FTE),” “total revenue (FTE),” "noninterest income as a percent of total revenue", and certain ratios derived from these measures. The Bancorp believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by the Fifth Third management team to evaluate operating performance and to make day-to-day operating decisions.

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and net interest margin as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.

The Bancorp believes tangible net income available to common shareholders, average tangible common equity, tangible common equity (excluding AOCI), tangible common equity (including AOCI), tangible equity, tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity are important measures for evaluating the performance of the business without the impacts of intangible items, whether acquired or created internally, in a manner comparable to other companies in the industry who present similar measures. 

The Bancorp believes noninterest income, noninterest expense, net interest income, net interest margin, pre-provision net revenue, efficiency ratio, noninterest income as a percent of total revenue, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, and return on average assets are important measures that adjust for significant, unusual, or large transactions that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance and enhances comparability of results with prior periods. 

The Bancorp believes noninterest income excluding certain items and noninterest expense excluding certain items are important measures that adjust for certain components that are prone to significant period-to-period changes in order to facilitate the explanation of variances in the noninterest income and noninterest expense line items.

Management considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity and tangible common equity (including and excluding AOCI), in addition to capital ratios defined by U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that providing the tangible common equity ratio excluding AOCI on certain assets and liabilities enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity without the effects of changes in AOCI, some of which are uncertain; providing the tangible common equity ratio including AOCI enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity if components of AOCI, such as unrealized gains or losses, were to be monetized.

Please note that although non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight, they should not be considered in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for analysis using GAAP measures. 

Please see reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, beginning on the following page.
