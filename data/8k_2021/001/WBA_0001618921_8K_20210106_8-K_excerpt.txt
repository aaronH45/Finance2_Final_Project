 Item 1.01.  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

Share Purchase Agreement  

On January 6, 2021, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement” and together with the transactions contemplated thereby, the “Transaction”) with AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”). In connection with the Transaction, the Company and AmerisourceBergen also agreed to (i) a three-year extension through 2029 of the US pharmaceutical distribution agreement pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S., (ii) a three-year extension of the agreement, that provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH, the Company’s global sourcing enterprise, (iii) a distribution agreement pursuant to which AmerisourceBergen will supply branded and generic pharmaceutical products to the Company’s Boots UK business following the closing of the Transaction and (iv) explore a series of strategic initiatives designed to create incremental growth and efficiencies in sourcing, logistics and distribution.  

Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement, AmerisourceBergen will purchase the majority of the Company’s Alliance Healthcare business (the “Business”) for approximately $6.5 billion, comprised of $6.275 billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and 2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock. AmerisourceBergen expects to fund the cash purchase price through a combination of cash on hand and new debt financing, and has obtained $3.025 billion in bridge financing commitments in connection with the Transaction. Alliance Healthcare’s investments in China and Italy and its operations in Germany are not part of the Transaction. The Company will account for the Transaction as a business disposition and report the financial results of the Business as discontinued operations beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.  

The foregoing description of the Share Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Share Purchase Agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Share Purchase Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between those parties, and do not establish these matters as facts. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, ABC or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.  

A&R Shareholders Agreement  

In connection with the closing of the Transaction, the Company and AmerisourceBergen will enter into an Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement (the “A&R Shareholders Agreement”), which amends and restates in its entirety the existing Shareholders Agreement of AmerisourceBergen, dated March 18, 2013 (the “Existing Shareholders Agreement”). The A&R Shareholders Agreement, among other things, increases by 1% the percentage of outstanding AmerisourceBergen Common Stock which the Company and its affiliates are permitted to hold.  

The foregoing description of the changes between the Existing Shareholders Agreement and the A&R Shareholders Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of A&R Shareholders Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

On January 6, 2021, the Company and AmerisourceBergen issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
