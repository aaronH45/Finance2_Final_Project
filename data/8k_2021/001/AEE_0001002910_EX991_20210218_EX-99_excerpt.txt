and Issues Guidance for 2021 Earnings and Long-Term Growth

•2020 Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) were $3.50, Compared to $3.35 in 2019

•2021 Diluted EPS Guidance Range Established at $3.65 to $3.85

•2021 through 2025 EPS Growth Rate Guidance Established

ST. LOUIS (Feb. 18, 2021) — Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2020 net income attributable to common shareholders of $871 million, or $3.50 per diluted share, compared to 2019 net income attributable to common shareholders of $828 million, or $3.35 per diluted share.

Earnings results for 2020 were driven by strong operating performance and execution of the company's strategy despite the challenges associated with COVID-19. Higher earnings were the result of increased infrastructure investments across all business segments. Earnings were positively impacted by new Ameren Missouri electric service rates effective April 1, 2020, driven in part by earnings on infrastructure investments. In addition, Ameren Missouri's operations and maintenance expenses were lower due to a Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) approved change in the timing of expense recognition for the Callaway Energy Center scheduled nuclear refueling and maintenance outage, as well as from disciplined cost management. Earnings also benefited from the impact of the May 2020 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order addressing the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) allowed base return on equity at Ameren Transmission. These favorable factors were partially offset by lower Ameren Missouri electric retail sales due to the impact of COVID-19 and weather, as well as lower energy efficiency performance incentives compared to 2019. Finally, the earnings comparison reflected increased interest expense primarily due to higher long-term debt outstanding at Ameren Missouri and Ameren Parent, as well as a lower allowed return on equity at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution.

"In 2020, we successfully executed our strategy across our businesses while continuing our relentless focus on the safety of our co-workers, customers and communities during these unprecedented times due to COVID-19," said Warner L. Baxter, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. “We remain focused on our robust energy infrastructure investment plan to deliver reliable, affordable and cleaner electric and gas services

for our customers. These investments will allow us to continue to deliver significant long-term value as we build a sustainable energy future for generations to come."

"I am also pleased to report that we made significant progress on sustainability initiatives tied to environmental, social and governance matters in 2020," Baxter said. "This included establishing an Ameren-wide net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 and robust interim carbon emission reductions in conjunction with filing a comprehensive Integrated Resource Plan in Missouri that significantly accelerated our transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio. A significant milestone toward accomplishing our net zero carbon emissions goal was reached with the acquisition of the 400 megawatt High Prairie Renewable Energy Center in December. In addition, we provided over $23 million in COVID-19 relief and energy assistance to our customers. We also committed $10 million over five years to non-profits focused on diversity, equity and inclusion and significantly increased our spend to approximately $800 million with diverse suppliers. Finally, our board of directors took steps to directly tie executive incentive compensation to environmental, social and governance metrics, as well as enhance its oversight of sustainability matters." 

Ameren recorded net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2020, of $115 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $94 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2019. 

The year-over-year increase in fourth quarter 2020 earnings was due to increased infrastructure investments across all of our business segments, new Ameren Missouri electric service rates effective April 1, 2020, and lower operations and maintenance expenses, primarily at Ameren Missouri. These favorable factors were partially offset by increased interest expense due to higher long-term debt outstanding at Ameren Missouri and Ameren Parent, as well as a lower allowed return on equity at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution.

Earnings, Rate Base and Dividend Guidance

Ameren expects 2021 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.65 to $3.85. Ameren expects diluted earnings per share to grow at a 6% to 8% compound annual rate from 2021 through 2025, using the 2021 guidance range midpoint of $3.75 per share as the base. Ameren's multi-year earnings growth is expected to be driven by strong projected rate base growth of approximately 8% compounded annually from 2020 through 2025. 

"Last week, we were pleased to announce an increase to our quarterly dividend, which marked the eighth consecutive year of growth," said Baxter. "This increase, coupled with the dividend increase of 4% in October 2020, reflects confidence by the Ameren Board of Directors in the outlook for our businesses and management's ability to execute its strategy for the long-term benefit of its customers and shareholders. Ameren expects future dividend growth to be in line with its long-term earnings-per-share growth expectations and within a payout ratio of 55% to 70%. In addition to earnings growth considerations, future dividend decisions will be driven by cash flow, investment requirements and other business conditions."

"Looking ahead, we remain focused on strong execution of our strategy. We have a robust pipeline of critical infrastructure investments to modernize the energy grid and transition to a cleaner energy portfolio in a responsible fashion. These investments, combined with our continued focus on disciplined cost management, will continue to

deliver superior value to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders, while keeping customer rates affordable," Baxter said. 

Ameren's earnings guidance for 2021 and multi-year growth expectations assume normal temperatures and are subject to the effects of, among other things: the impacts of COVID-19; 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields; regulatory, judicial and legislative actions; energy center and energy distribution operations; energy, economic, capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release. 

Ameren Missouri Segment Results

Ameren Missouri 2020 earnings were $436 million, compared to 2019 earnings of $426 million. The year-over-year improvement reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, 2020. In addition, operations and maintenance expenses were lower due to the MoPSC-approved change in the timing of expense recognition for the Callaway Energy Center scheduled nuclear refueling and maintenance outage, as well as from disciplined cost management. These favorable factors were partially offset by lower electric sales from milder-than-normal summer and winter temperatures compared to near-normal temperatures in the year-ago period, as well as due to the impact of COVID-19. In addition, the comparison was negatively impacted by lower energy efficiency performance incentives compared to the year-ago period and increased interest expense due to higher long-term debt outstanding.

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution Segment Results

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution 2020 earnings were $143 million, compared to 2019 earnings of $146 million. The year-over-year comparison reflected increased earnings on infrastructure and energy efficiency investments that were more than offset by a lower allowed return on equity due to a lower average 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield in 2020 compared to 2019. 

Ameren Illinois Natural Gas Segment Results

Ameren Illinois Natural Gas 2020 earnings were $99 million, compared to 2019 earnings of $84 million. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased earnings on infrastructure investments and lower operations and maintenance expenses due to disciplined cost management.

Ameren Transmission Segment Results

Ameren Transmission 2020 earnings were $216 million, compared to 2019 earnings of $185 million. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased earnings on infrastructure investments and the impact of the May 2020 FERC order addressing the MISO allowed base return on equity.

Ameren Parent Results (includes items not reported in a business segment)

Ameren Parent results for 2020 reflected a loss of $23 million, compared to a 2019 loss of $13 million. The year-over-year comparison reflected increased interest expense primarily due to higher long-term debt outstanding and lower tax benefits associated with share-based compensation.
