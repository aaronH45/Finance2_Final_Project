Other Events.  

On January 13, 2021, Aon Global Limited (f/k/a Aon plc), a limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales and a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon plc, issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to holders of its 2.800% Senior Notes due March 15, 2021 (NYSE: AON21) (the “Notes”) for the redemption of all $400 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding on February 15, 2021 (the “Redemption Date”) at a redemption price equal to $404,666,666.67 (the “Redemption Price”).  

The Redemption Price, which has been calculated in accordance with the terms of the indenture and the Notes, equals the sum of (i) $400,000,000.00, or 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date of $4,666,666.67, equal to $11.67 per $1,000.00 principal amount of the Notes. Therefore, the aggregate Redemption Price to be paid on the Redemption Date is equal to $404,666,666.67, or $1,011.67 per $1,000.00 principal amount of the Notes.  

Payment of the Redemption Price will be made on or after the Redemption Date upon presentation and surrender of the Notes (subject to applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company) to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., which will be acting as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”), at the following address: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, NY 13057, Attn: Redemption Unit Corporate Trust Operations. The Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent in order to collect the Redemption Price.  

No Notes will remain outstanding following the redemption. The foregoing does not constitute a notice of redemption with respect to the Notes.
