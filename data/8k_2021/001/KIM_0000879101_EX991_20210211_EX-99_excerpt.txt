 Financial Results  

 Fourth Quarter 2020  

 Net income available to the company’s common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $194.9 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $92.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2019. The year-over-year change was primarily due to:    $148.5 million in the mark-to-market adjustment on 39.8 million common shares of Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE: ACI) held by the company.   ($21.2) million from potentially uncollectible receivables, including $9.7 million in abatements.   ($24.5) million decrease in gains on the sales of properties, net of impairments, including those in joint ventures.   $10.3 million associated with a $7.2 million charge for the redemption of preferred stock during the fourth quarter of 2019 resulting in $3.1 million less in preferred dividends paid during the fourth quarter of 2020.   

 NAREIT Funds From Operations (FFO)* was $133.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $151.9 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2019.

 Fourth Quarter 2020 Operating Results    Pro-rata portfolio occupancy ended the quarter at 93.9% with anchor and small shop occupancy at 96.7% and 86.1%, respectively.   The company executed a total of 247 leases totaling 1.1 million square feet. This includes 92 new leases for 406,000 square feet which represents a significant increase over the 295,000 square feet of new leases signed during the third quarter of 2020 and 344,000 square feet of new leases for the comparable period in 2019.   Pro-rata rental-rate spreads on comparable spaces increased 6.0%, with rental rates for new leases up 6.8% and renewals/options growing by 5.6%.   Same-property Net Operating Income (NOI)* decreased 10.5% from the fourth quarter of 2019 due primarily to a charge for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2020, same-property NOI decreased 8.0% compared to the prior year.   

 Capital Markets    Ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of immediate liquidity, including full availability under the company’s $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, and $293 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, Kimco held over $700 million of Albertsons common stock at the end of the quarter, subject to certain lock-up provisions.   Kimco’s consolidated weighted-average debt maturity profile of 10.9 years remains one of the longest in the REIT industry. The company’s upcoming debt maturities in 2021 total approximately 3% of total pro-rata debt, which is the lowest level over the next seven years. This includes only $204.2 million of total pro-rata mortgage debt coming due with no unsecured debt maturities in 2021. Kimco’s next unsecured bond does not mature until November of 2022.   

 COVID-19 Update    At the end of January, all of Kimco’s shopping centers were open and operational with 97% of tenants open, based on annualized base rent (ABR), including those that are operating on a limited basis.   Kimco has collected 92% of the total pro-rata base rents billed for the fourth quarter of 2020. Subsequently, collections for total pro-rata base rents billed in January were approximately 91%.   The company granted rent deferrals totaling 1.9% of pro-rata minimum base rent for the fourth quarter of 2020. The company continues to negotiate the payment of rents not yet collected or deferred.   

 Dividends  

 During 2020, Kimco paid cash dividends totaling $0.82 per common share. Kimco’s Board of Directors will continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the company’s operations and expects to establish a more normalized and well-covered dividend level based on our projection of REIT taxable income and adjusted funds from operations for 2021.

 $0.46 to $0.52
