SECTION 2. FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  

 Item 2.05.  

Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.  

On January 19, 2021, Federal Express Corporation (“FedEx Express”), a subsidiary of FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”), announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe as it nears the completion of the network integration of TNT Express. A copy of the press release issued by FedEx Express on January 19, 2021 announcing the plan is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The execution of the plan is subject to a consultation process that will occur over an 18-month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations. The plan will impact between 5,500 and 6,300 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions.  

We expect the pre-tax cost of the severance benefits to be provided under the plan to range from $300 million to $575 million in cash expenditures. These charges are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2023 and will be classified as business realignment expenses. We expect savings from the plan to be between $275 million and $350 million on an annualized basis beginning in fiscal 2024. The actual amount and timing of cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectations and estimates.  

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  

Certain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K, such as statements relating to FedEx’s and FedEx Express’s estimates of pre-tax cash expenditures and savings as a result of the workforce reduction plan and the timeline for completion, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those preceded by, followed by or that include the words “will,” “may,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “believe,” “expected,” “anticipated,” “plans,” “estimates,” “targets,” “projects,” “intends” or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the ability of FedEx Express to receive works council approvals, the disruption of ongoing business, our ability to successfully integrate the FedEx Express and TNT networks in the expected time frame and at the expected cost and to achieve the expected benefits from the combined businesses, and other factors which can be found in FedEx’s and FedEx Express’s press releases and FedEx’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. FedEx and FedEx Express do not undertake or assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
