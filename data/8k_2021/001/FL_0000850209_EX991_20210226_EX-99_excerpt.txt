NEW YORK, NY, February 26, 2021 – Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL), the New York-based specialty athletic retailer, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 30, 2021. 

Fourth Quarter Results 

The Company reported net income of $123 million, or $1.17 per share, for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2021, a decrease of 7.9 percent in earnings per share as compared with net income of $134 million, or $1.27 per share, for the corresponding prior-year period. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company earned $1.55 per share, a 4.9 percent decrease from non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.63 in the comparable prior-year period. 

Fourth quarter comparable-store sales decreased by 2.7 percent. Total sales decreased by 1.4 percent, to $2,189 million this year, compared with sales of $2,221 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, total sales for the fourth quarter decreased by 3.0 percent. 

“Despite the challenging macro backdrop of COVID-related store closures and supply chain congestion, we delivered strong bottom-line results in the fourth quarter,” said Richard Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our customers responded well to our solid product offering and exciting holiday campaign, which drove stronger margins and continued acceleration of our digital business. Based on the resiliency we have shown over the course of 2020, I am looking forward with renewed optimism as we continue to advance our long-term strategies and build value for all our stakeholders.” 

“Our teams continued to execute nimbly in the fourth quarter to manage against the headwinds to our top line. As a result, we delivered gross margin expansion and improved inventory turns, while maintaining our discipline with expense management,” added Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Although over 10 percent of our store fleet is temporarily closed at present due to COVID-19 restrictions, the strength of our financial position leaves us well prepared to continue navigating the macro challenges, while protecting our bottom line and investing in our growth.”

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to reporting the Company's financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. We have presented certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP, such as sales changes excluding foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 

We present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our business that are not related to currency movements. 

These non-GAAP measures are presented because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business or affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives. 

We estimate the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal tax rate to each of the respective items. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period.

Notes on Non-GAAP Adjustments: 

 (1)Included with this caption are impairment charges and other charges, as follows: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended January 30, 2021, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $59 million and $117 million, respectively, classified as Impairment and Other Charges. This compares with charges of $49 million and $65 million recognized for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended February 1, 2020, respectively. See the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about the charges recorded during 2019. 

During the fourth quarter of 2020, we conducted an impairment review for approximately 90 underperforming stores. We evaluated the long-lived assets, including the right-of-use assets and recorded non-cash charges of $62 million to write down store fixtures, leasehold improvements, and right-of-use assets for approximately 60 locations. 

Cost and losses related to social unrest represented inventory losses, damages to store property, repairs, and other costs incurred in connection with the riots that affected certain parts of the United States and Canada during the second and third quarters of 2020. For the full year, the charge represented inventory losses of $15 million, damages to store property of $1 million, repairs and other costs of $2 million. During the fourth quarter, we recorded a partial insurance recovery of $10 million. We are continuing to work with our insurers to determine the remaining amount of our covered losses under our property insurance policy. Additional insurance recoveries will be recorded in the period in which we conclude our settlement discussions with our insurance providers. 

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a charge of $4 million related to one of our minority investments. Additionally, in connection with the reorganization of certain headquarters and supply chain support functions in EMEA, we recorded severance costs of $4 million during the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Included in the year-to-date period of 2020 are charges related to the shutdown of the Runners Point business of $19 million, costs related to the restructuring of the Eastbay business of $3 million, and costs related to the pension plan reformation of $2 million. 

 (2)The Company recorded a non-cash gain of $190 million, or $140 million after-tax, during the third quarter of 2020. This gain was related to one of our minority investments that is measured using the fair value measurement alternative, which received additional funding at a higher valuation than the initial investment. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $4 million in connection with the exchange of a note for a distribution center lease and related fixed assets. The tax expense was fully offset by the release of a valuation allowance. 

 (3)During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a $27 million tax charge related to the revaluation of certain intellectual property rights, pursuant to a non-U.S. advance pricing agreement. During the second and third quarter of 2020, we performed quarterly valuations and due to the improved financial outlook we reduced the charge by $2 million and $1 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the valuation resulted in a charge of $1 million. 

 (4)The Company recognized a tax benefit of $5 million and $2 million during the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively, in connection with tax law changes in the Netherlands. 

 (5)In connection with U.S. tax reform, the Company recorded a charge of $2 million during the third quarter of 2019, which reflected an adjustment to U.S. tax on foreign income. 

 (6)During 2019, valuation allowances were established against deferred tax assets associated with certain foreign tax losses.
