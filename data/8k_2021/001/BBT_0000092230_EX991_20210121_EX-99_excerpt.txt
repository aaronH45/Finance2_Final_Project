CHARLOTTE, N.C., (January 21, 2021) — Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE: TFC) today reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Net income available to common shareholders was $1.2 billion, up 74.9 percent, compared to the fourth quarter last year. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.90, an increase of 20.0 percent compared with the same period last year. Results for the fourth quarter produced an annualized return on average assets (ROA) of 1.05 percent, an annualized return on average common shareholders' equity (ROCE) of 7.88 percent, and an annualized return on tangible common shareholders' equity (ROTCE) of 14.99 percent.

Adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $1.6 billion, or $1.18 per diluted share, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges of $308 million ($237 million after-tax) and incremental operating expenses related to the merger of $179 million ($138 million after-tax). Adjusted results produced an annualized ROA of 1.35 percent, an annualized ROCE of 10.25 percent and an annualized ROTCE of 19.03 percent.

"In a year of unprecedented challenges for our nation and the financial services industry, I’m extremely proud of our teammates and their rapid and sustained response to meet the needs of our clients and communities," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kelly S. King. "Despite this difficult environment, our performance was very strong in 2020 and we closed the year on a high point with our best quarter yet in terms of financial performance.

"Our fourth quarter results reflect a significant decline in the provision for credit losses and strong results from many of our noninterest-income generating businesses. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 55.9 percent and our adjusted return on tangible common equity was very strong at 19.03 percent.

"Adjusted net income was a record $1.6 billion, or $1.18 per share, due to a strong performance from our insurance business, and record results from investment banking and commercial real estate income, as well as a solid performance in net interest income in this challenging interest rate environment. 

"We continue to invest in the future with our client-first strategy and the overall growth and diversification of our company. This includes the acquisition of five insurance brokerages in the fourth quarter, which are expected to boost insurance revenues by $110 million annually. We're also investing selectively in digital and agile capabilities, as well as investment banking, residential mortgage and wealth management talent to meet the evolving needs of our clients.

"In the midst of a global health pandemic, our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities guided us to take extraordinary measures in 2020 to support our teammates, clients, and communities. This included over $100 million in special COVID-19 support for teammates; payment relief assistance through more than 750,000 client loan accommodations; $50 million through Truist Cares to support front-line community needs and $78 million to support historically underrepresented communities; and helping approximately 80,000 companies secure nearly $13 billion in Paycheck Protection Program funding to save nearly three million jobs. We strengthened our commitment to social justice, moving past words to meaningful and measurable actions. We also made great progress on our integration efforts with a focus on a smooth transition for our clients.

Fourth Quarter 2020 compared to Third Quarter 2020

Total taxable-equivalent revenue was $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $78 million compared to the prior quarter. This was primarily driven by an increase of $75 million in noninterest income resulting from record performances in investment banking and trading income and commercial real-estate related income.

The net interest margin was 3.08 percent for the fourth quarter, down two basis points compared to the prior quarter. The decline in the net interest margin reflects lower purchase accounting accretion and lower yield on securities due to the impact of new investments at lower rates. These decreases were partially offset by lower interest expense on deposits primarily due to the impact of lower rates on deposits, higher loan yields resulting from accelerated fee income recognition on PPP loan payoffs and the recognition of interest previously deferred on loans granted an accommodation in connection with COVID-19 relief programs and lower balances at the Federal Reserve. Average earning assets increased $3.3 billion compared to the prior quarter. Average securities available for sale increased $22.2 billion, while average other earning assets decreased $11.9 billion and average total loans decreased $7.5 billion. The growth in the average earnings assets reflects the purchase of additional securities using excess liquidity. The investment in average securities improved the net interest margin compared to the yields available on excess reserves at the Federal Reserve. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $433 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Average long-term debt decreased $635 million, while average short-term borrowings increased $284 million. The decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities was more than offset by an increase of $3.1 billion in average noninterest-bearing deposits compared to the third quarter of 2020.

- 3 -

The yield on the total loan portfolio for the fourth quarter was 4.12 percent, up eight basis points compared to the prior quarter primarily due to accelerated fee recognition for PPP loan payoffs and the recognition of interest previously deferred on loans granted an accommodation in connection with COVID-19 relief programs, partially offset by lower accretion of the fair value mark on the merged loans. The yield on the average securities portfolio for the fourth quarter was 1.60 percent, down 37 basis points compared to the prior quarter primarily due to lower yields on new purchases.

The average cost of total deposits was 0.07 percent, down three basis points compared to the prior quarter, and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.11 percent, down four basis points compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in rates on deposits was attributable to deposit rate cuts and maturities of higher cost time-deposits. The average rate on long-term debt was 1.64 percent, up 16 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The increase in the rate on long-term debt was primarily due to interest expense associated with structured real estate transactions that were completed. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 0.77 percent, down eight basis points compared to the prior quarter.

The provision for credit losses was $177 million and net charge-offs were $205 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $421 million and $326 million, respectively, for the prior quarter. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to lower net charge-offs and a decrease in loans and leases held for investment, including the transfer of $1.0 billion to held for sale due to the decision to exit a small ticket loan and lease portfolio.

Noninterest income was $2.3 billion, an increase of $75 million compared to the prior quarter. The prior quarter included $104 million of securities gains. Excluding securities gains, noninterest income increased $179 million compared to the prior quarter. Commercial real-estate related income increased $68 million primarily due to an increase of $37 million in fees from the completion of structured real estate transactions coupled with $24 million from strong commercial mortgage production and sales activity. Investment banking and trading revenues increased $64 million due to an increase in trading income of $41 million partially due to a recovery of CVA losses, as well as improved trading profits, and $23 million from higher investment banking revenues primarily due to strong M&A and loan syndication fees. Insurance income increased $27 million primarily due to higher new business and acquisitions. Lending related fees increased $28 million primarily due to gains from early payoffs of certain finance-related lease transactions. Residential mortgage income decreased $28 million primarily due to a decrease of $109 million in production-related revenues largely a result of reduced margins and seasonally lower volumes partially offset by an increase of $81 million in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights.

- 4 -

Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, up $78 million compared to the prior quarter. Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $72 million primarily due to higher facilities impairments and severance charges, partially offset by lower professional services expenses. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger increased $27 million primarily due to higher professional services expenses for process and system design in connection with merger integration. The prior quarter also included a $50 million charitable contribution to the Truist Charitable Fund. Excluding the items mentioned above and changes in amortization of intangibles, adjusted noninterest expense was up $27 million. Personnel expense increased $50 million compared to the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to higher incentives resulting from strong production and job regrading, partially offset by lower equity-based compensation due to expense for retirement eligible teammates being fully expensed by the end of the third quarter. During the fourth quarter the company completed a post-merger reevaluation of job grades and recorded additional salaries, incentives and equity-based compensation expenses. Approximately $60 million of the job regrading personnel expenses were one-time in nature. Professional fees and outside processing expenses increased $70 million, which includes an increase of $25 million related to merger activities. Excluding the merger-related increase, the remaining increase is primarily related to professional services for strategic technology projects. Net occupancy expense decreased $26 million primarily due to lower rent expense resulting from the final valuation of certain acquired leases and decreases from vacated properties, as well as lower costs for related janitorial cleaning and supplies. Marketing and customer development expenses decreased $17 million primarily due to lower advertising and public relations expense. Other expense decreased $63 million primarily due to the $50 million charitable contribution made in the prior quarter.

The provision for income taxes was $311 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $255 million for the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.0 percent, compared to 18.3 percent for the prior quarter. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to higher pre-tax income.

Fourth Quarter 2020 compared to Fourth Quarter 2019

Total taxable-equivalent revenues were $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting an increase of $1.1 billion in taxable-equivalent net interest income and an increase of $887 million in noninterest income.

Net interest margin was 3.08 percent, down 33 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. Average earning assets increased $175.6 billion. The increase in average earning assets reflects a $114.5 billion increase in average total loans and leases and a $41.4 billion increase in average securities. Average other earning assets increased $17.5 billion primarily due to higher interest-earning balances at the Federal Reserve. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $107.3 billion compared to the earlier quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $101.9 billion, average long-term debt increased $10.4 billion and average short-term borrowings decreased $5.0 billion. The significant increases in earning assets and liabilities are primarily due to the merger, as well as impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government stimulus programs.

The yield on the total loan portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 4.12 percent, down 79 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting the impact of rate decreases, partially offset by purchase accounting accretion from merged loans. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 1.60 percent, down 105 basis points compared to the earlier quarter primarily due to lower yields on new purchases.

The average rate on long-term debt was 1.64 percent, down 128 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower rate environment. The lower rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt and the issuance of new long-term debt.

The provision for credit losses was $177 million, compared to $171 million for the earlier quarter. Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $205 million compared to $192 million in the earlier quarter. The net charge-off rate for the current quarter of 0.27 percent was down 13 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.

Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased $887 million compared to the earlier quarter. The earlier quarter included a loss of $116 million from the sale of securities. Excluding the securities losses, noninterest income increased $771 million, with nearly all categories of noninterest income being impacted by the merger. Insurance income increased $36 million due to strong production and premium growth, as well as acquisitions. Investment banking and trading income, commercial real estate related income, wealth management income and residential mortgage banking income all had improved performance compared to the combined levels from the earlier quarter. Service charges on deposits has continued to rebound, but remained below 2019 combined levels due to reduced overdraft incident rates.

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was up $1.3 billion compared to the earlier quarter. Merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the merger increased $85 million and $78 million, respectively.

The provision for income taxes was $311 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $153 million for the earlier quarter. This produced an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 of 19.0 percent, compared to 17.4 percent for the earlier quarter.

Average commercial loans decreased $5.4 billion, primarily in commercial and industrial loans due to paydowns on commercial lines. This was partially offset by growth in mortgage warehouse lending, dealer floor plan lending and governmental finance loans.

Capital ratios and return on risk-weighted assets are preliminary.

This news release contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Truist's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance and the efficiency of its operations. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results with prior periods and demonstrate the effects of significant items in the current period. The Corporation believes a meaningful analysis of its financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance. Truist's management believes investors may find these non-GAAP financial measures useful. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Below is a listing of the types of non-GAAP measures used in this news release:

- 13 -

•The adjusted efficiency ratio is non-GAAP in that it excludes securities gains (losses), amortization of intangible assets, merger-related and restructuring charges and other selected items. Truist's management uses this measure in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Truist's management believes this measure provides a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of results with prior periods, as well as demonstrates the effects of significant gains and charges.

•Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. These measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. Truist's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk. 

•Core net interest margin is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts net interest margin to exclude the impact of purchase accounting. The purchase accounting marks and related amortization for a) securities acquired from the FDIC in the Colonial Bank acquisition and b) loans, deposits and long-term debt from SunTrust, Susquehanna, National Penn and Colonial Bank are excluded to approximate the yields paid by clients. Interest income for PCI loans adjusts the accretion, net of interest reversals, which approximates the interest received from the client. Truist's management believes the adjustments to the calculation of net interest margin for certain assets and liabilities acquired provide investors with useful information related to the performance of Truist's earning assets.

•The adjusted diluted earnings per share is non-GAAP in that it excludes merger-related and restructuring charges and other selected items, net of tax. Truist's management uses this measure in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Truist's management believes this measure provides a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of results with prior periods, as well as demonstrates the effects of significant gains and charges.

•The adjusted performance ratios, including adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average common shareholders’ equity and adjusted return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity, are non-GAAP in that they exclude merger-related and restructuring charges, selected items and, in the case of return on average tangible common shareholders' equity, amortization of intangible assets. Truist's management uses these measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. Truist's management believes these measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of results with prior periods, as well as demonstrates the effects of significant gains and charges.

•EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement of operating profitability that is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to net income. Truist's management also adds back merger-related and restructuring charges, incremental operating expenses related to the merger and other selected items. Truist's management uses this measure in its analysis of the Corporation's Insurance Holdings segment. Truist's management believes this measure provides a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of results with prior periods, as well as demonstrates the effects of significant gains and charges.

•Allowance for loan and lease losses and unamortized fair value mark as a percentage of gross loans and leases is a non-GAAP measurement of credit reserves that is calculated by adjusting the ALLL and loans and leases held for investment by the unamortized fair value mark. Truist's management uses these measures to assess loss absorption capacity.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix to Truist's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Presentation, which is available at https://ir.truist.com/earnings.
