CEO Commentary

“During 2020, our business and operational resilience, enhanced by our technology and digital capabilities, enabled us to rapidly support our clients, employees and the financial system through immense stress and volatility. At the same time, we continued to advance our strategic priorities and longer-term growth agenda across all of our businesses. The investments we’ve made over the past several years, especially in technology and operations, served us and our clients well amid some difficult circumstances, and I want to thank our employees for their extraordinary efforts in supporting our clients during an unprecedented year,” Todd Gibbons, Chief Executive Officer, said.

“Full-year EPS was $3.83, down from $4.51, reflecting the impact of notable items. On an operating basis EPS was flat at $4.01, despite the impact of credit provisions, lower interest rates and associated money market fee waivers,” Mr. Gibbons added.

“While the full-year impact of low interest rates will be a significant headwind in 2021, we ended the year with momentum in our core franchise. We feel good about our business model and the power of the open architecture platforms and solutions we provide to help our clients grow their businesses. Our enterprise is incredibly strong and interconnected and our breadth of services and capabilities is unrivalled within our peer group, positioning us well for future growth. We have one of the industry’s best client rosters and a highly motivated group of talented employees executing our strategy, which is centered on driving growth and creating value for our clients, scaling and digitizing our operating model, and fostering a high-performance culture that is focused on delivering excellent client service in new and innovative ways,” Mr. Gibbons further noted. 

“The combination of our capital generation, revenue growth and good cost control gives us the ability to drive meaningful EPS growth over time,” Mr. Gibbons concluded.

KEY DRIVERS (comparisons are 4Q20 vs. 4Q19, unless otherwise stated)

•Total revenue decreased 20%, or 2% excluding the notable items (a) primarily reflecting:

•Fee revenue decreased 22% primarily reflecting the gain on sale of an equity investment recorded in 4Q19.

INVESTMENT SERVICES BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Consists of AUC/A primarily from the Asset Servicing business and, to a lesser extent, the Clearance and Collateral Management, Issuer Services, Pershing and Wealth Management businesses.

 KEY DRIVERS

•The drivers of the total revenue variances by line of business are indicated below.

•Asset Servicing - The year-over-year decrease includes lower interest rates and higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by higher market values and foreign exchange volumes and volatility. Sequentially, higher foreign exchange volumes and market values were offset by the impact of some repricing on client renewals, lower interest rates and higher money market fee waivers. 

•Pershing - The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the impact of money market fee waivers, partially offset by higher clearing revenue, higher balances and the positive impact of equity markets. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher clearing revenue and market values, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers. 

•Issuer Services - The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates and higher money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the timing of Depositary Receipts revenue, higher money market fee waivers and lower interest rates in Corporate Trust.

•Treasury Services - The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates, including higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by higher client deposits, payment fees and money market balances. The sequential increase reflects higher foreign exchange revenue and payment volumes, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers.

•Clearance and Collateral Management - The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower investment income due to the 4Q19 sale of an equity investment and lower intraday credit fees, partially offset by growth in non-U.S. collateral management. 

•Noninterest expense decreased slightly year-over-year primarily reflecting lower severance offset by higher litigation expense. Excluding the notable items, noninterest expense increased slightly (a), primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower business development (travel and marketing) expense. Sequentially, noninterest expense increased 8%, primarily reflecting higher litigation and severance expenses. Excluding the notable items, noninterest expense increased 2% (a), primarily reflecting higher professional, legal and other purchased services and the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Both comparisons also reflect continued investments in technology.

(a) Notable items in 4Q20 and 4Q19 include severance and litigation expense. There were no notable items in 3Q20. See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” on page 10 for additional information.

(c) Includes AUM and AUC/A in the Wealth Management business. 

KEY DRIVERS

•The drivers of the total revenue variances by line of business are indicated below.

•Investment Management - The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by the impact of money market fee waivers. The sequential increase primarily reflects the timing of performance fees, higher market values and seed capital gains, net of hedges.

•Wealth Management - Total revenue decreased 1% year-over-year and decreased slightly sequentially primarily reflecting a loss on a business sale. Excluding the notable item, total revenue increased 1% (a) year-over-year and sequentially primarily reflecting higher market values, partially offset by a shift to lower fee investment products and the impact of net outflows. 

•Noninterest expense decreased 6% year-over-year primarily reflecting lower staff expense, including severance, and lower business development expense. Excluding the notable items, noninterest expense decreased 5% (a), primarily reflecting lower incentives, business development and distribution and servicing expenses.

The following table presents the impact of money market fee waivers on our consolidated fee revenue, net of distribution and servicing expense. In 4Q20, the net impact of money market fee waivers was $134 million, up from $101 million in 3Q20, driven by low short-term interest rates.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Regulatory capital ratios for Dec. 31, 2020 are preliminary. For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under the U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, which for the periods noted above was the Advanced Approaches.

(b) Reflects the application of a rule effective April 1, 2020 to exclude certain central bank placements. Also effective on April 1, 2020 was the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities from the leverage exposure used in the SLR calculation which increased our consolidated SLR by 72 basis points at Dec. 31, 2020 and 78 basis points at Sept. 30, 2020. 

(c) Tangible book value per common share – Non-GAAP excludes goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” on page 10 for information on this Non-GAAP measure.

•CET1 capital totaled $21.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2020, an increase of $704 million compared with Sept. 30, 2020. The increase primarily reflects capital generated through earnings and foreign currency translation, partially offset by capital deployed through dividend payments.

NET INTEREST REVENUE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Net interest revenue (FTE) – Non-GAAP and net interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP include the tax equivalent adjustments on tax-exempt income. See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” on page 10 for information on this Non-GAAP measure. 

bps – basis points.

•Net interest revenue decreased 17% year-over-year. The decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates on interest-earning assets and the impact of hedging activities (primarily offset in foreign exchange and other trading revenue). This was partially offset by the benefit of lower deposit and funding rates, a larger securities portfolio and higher deposit balances.

•Sequentially, the decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates on interest-earning assets. This was partially offset by higher deposit balances and lower debt balances.

BNY Mellon 4Q20 Earnings Release

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION – EXPLANATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Release certain Non-GAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to GAAP information, which exclude goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible common equity is additional useful information for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income, and the tangible book value per common share is additional useful information because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. 

Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis – Non-GAAP and net interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP and other FTE measures include the tax equivalent adjustments on tax-exempt income which allows for the comparison of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating margin for the Investment and Wealth Management business net of distribution and servicing expense that was passed to third parties who distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that this measure is useful when evaluating the performance of the Investment and Wealth Management business relative to industry competitors. 

For the reconciliations of these Non-GAAP measures, see “Supplemental Information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in the Financial Supplement available at www.bnymellon.com.

BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures excluding notable items, including the gain on the sale of an equity investment, a lease-related impairment, losses on business sales and investment securities losses related to the sale of certain securities. Expense measures, excluding notable items, including severance, litigation, a net reduction of reserves for tax-related exposure of certain investment management funds and real estate charges are also presented. Litigation expense represents accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees. Income before tax measures, excluding the notable items mentioned above are provided. In addition, operating leverage, operating margins and diluted earnings per share, excluding the notable items impacting revenue, expense and income tax items mentioned above are adjusted to permit investors to view the financial measures on a basis consistent with how management views the businesses.
