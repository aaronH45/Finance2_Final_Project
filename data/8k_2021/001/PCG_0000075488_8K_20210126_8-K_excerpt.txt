Mr. Wright will serve as a principal executive officer of the Utility. 

As previously disclosed, effective upon Mr. Wright’s appointment, Sumeet Singh, Interim President, and Chief Risk Officer of the Utility, will return to his position as Senior Vice President and Chief Risk Officer of the Utility. 

Mr. Wright is currently a director and the Chief Executive Officer and President of MidAmerican Energy Company (“MidAmerican”), a Berkshire Hathaway Energy company providing electric and natural gas service to nearly 1.6 million customers in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and South Dakota, and a manager and the President of MidAmerican Funding LLC. Mr. Wright has been in those positions since 2018.

These RSUs will vest 50% on February 1, 2022 and 50% on February 1, 2023. All RSUs are subject to clawback under the Utility’s recoupment policy. Mr. Wright will also be eligible to receive executive benefits, as described in PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s joint Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed on March 31, 2020. 

There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Wright and any other persons pursuant to which he was selected as Executive Vice President, Operations and Chief Operating Officer of the Utility.
