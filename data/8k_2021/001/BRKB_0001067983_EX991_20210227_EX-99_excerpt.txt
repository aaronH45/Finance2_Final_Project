Exhibit 99.1  

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.  

NEWS RELEASE  

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    February 27, 2021  

Omaha, NE (BRK.A; BRK.B) –  

Berkshire’s operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and 2019 are summarized in the following paragraphs. However, we urge investors and reporters to read our 2020 Annual Report, which has been posted at www.berkshirehathaway.com. The limited information that follows in this press release is not adequate for making an informed investment judgment.  

Earnings of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and 2019 are summarized below. Earnings are stated on an after-tax basis. (Dollar amounts are in millions, except for per share amounts).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: Per share amounts for the Class B shares are 1/1,500th of those shown for the Class A.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules.  

 (2)  

Impairments of intangible assets in 2020 include charges of $9.8 billion recorded in the second quarter attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts Corp. in 2016. After-tax impairments of intangible assets in 2019 were $435 million and are included in operating earnings.   

An analysis of Berkshire’s operating earnings follows (dollar amounts are in millions).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Approximately $9 billion was used to purchase shares during the fourth quarter bringing the total for the year to approximately $25 billion. On December 31, 2020, there were 1,543,960 Class A equivalent shares outstanding. Insurance float (the net liabilities we assume under insurance contracts) was approximately $138 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $9 billion since yearend 2019.  

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein.  

Berkshire presents its results in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use Berkshire’s financial information. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net earnings, Berkshire shows operating earnings defined as net earnings exclusive of investment and derivative gains/losses and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets.  

Although the investment of insurance and reinsurance premiums to generate investment income and investment gains or losses is an integral part of Berkshire’s operations, the generation of investment gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, as previously described, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, we are now required to include the changes in unrealized gains/losses of our equity security investments as a component of investment gains/losses in our periodic earnings statements. In sum, investment gains/losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance.
