TransDigm Plans to Divest ScioTeq and TREALITY Businesses to OpenGate Capital

Cleveland, Ohio, March 1, 2021/PRNewswire / -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE: TDG), a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components, announced today it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its ScioTeq and TREALITY Simulation Visual Systems businesses (collectively, “the businesses”) to OpenGate Capital in a transaction valued at approximately $200 million. 

ScioTeq and TREALITY were acquired by TransDigm in March 2019 as part of the Esterline Technologies acquisition. The businesses develop and manufacture advanced visualization solutions primarily for the global defense, air traffic control, and security end markets. ScioTeq and TREALITY have approximately 450 employees and operate primarily from Belgium, with secondary locations in the United States. The businesses generated revenues of approximately $135 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.

W. Nicholas Howley, Executive Chairmen commented, “As previously communicated, we have been considering potentially divesting a few primarily defense, former Esterline businesses that do not align well with TransDigm’s strategy. As such, we are pleased to have an agreement for the divestiture of the ScioTeq and TREALITY businesses. These are well established businesses in the defense industry, and we are confident that their customers will continue to be well-served as we work toward a successful completion of the transaction.”

The divestiture, which is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed during the third quarter of our fiscal 2021.
