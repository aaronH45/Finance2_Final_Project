“We are very pleased to report fourth quarter core income of $1.3 billion, or $4.91 per diluted share, and core return on equity of 21%,” said Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The results benefited from strong underlying underwriting income, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.5 billion and an underlying combined ratio which improved 3.4 points from the prior year quarter to an excellent 88.7%. That brings full year core income to $2.7 billion, or $10.48 per diluted share, and full year core return on equity exceeding 11%, a terrific result in a challenging economic and operating environment. Full year core income includes record underlying underwriting profit of $2 billion. Our high-quality investment portfolio also performed well, generating net investment income of $572 million after-tax. Our operating results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 7% during the year, after returning $1.5 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including $672 million of share repurchases, which we resumed in the fourth quarter.

“Our top line remained remarkably resilient this quarter and throughout the year. For the quarter, net written premiums grew 3%, driven by continued strong renewal rate change and retention in each of our three segments. In Business Insurance, we achieved record renewal rate change of 8.4%, nearly 4 points higher than the prior year quarter, while retention remained strong. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12%, driven by record renewal premium change of 10.9% in our domestic management liability business, including record renewal rate change. In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7%, driven by strong renewal premium change of 8.2% in our Agency Homeowners business and strong retention and new business in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. 

“Our ability to deliver strong results over this past year in the face of an historic pandemic, a record number of PCS catastrophe events and historically low interest rates reflects the value of underwriting excellence, our leading data and analytics, the dedication of our highly engaged and talented workforce and the significant value we bring to our customers and distribution partners. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead as the economy reopens and to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time.”

Consolidated Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth Quarter 2020 Results

(All comparisons vs. fourth quarter 2019, unless noted otherwise)

Net income of $1.310 billion increased $437 million due to higher core income and higher net realized investment gains. Core income of $1.262 billion increased $395 million, primarily due to a higher underlying underwriting gain, higher net favorable prior year reserve development, higher net investment income and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying underwriting gain benefited from higher business volumes and a lower underlying combined ratio. Net realized investment gains were $50 million pre-tax ($48 million after-tax), compared to $12 million pre-tax ($6 million after-tax) in the prior year quarter. 

Combined ratio: 

•The combined ratio of 86.7% improved 5.7 points due to a lower underlying combined ratio (3.4 points), higher net favorable prior year reserve development (1.6 points) and lower catastrophe losses (0.7 points). 

•The underlying combined ratio of 88.7% improved 3.4 points. See below for further details by segment.

•Net favorable prior year reserve development occurred in all segments. See below for further details by segment. Catastrophe losses primarily resulted from Hurricane Zeta. 

Net investment income of $677 million pre-tax ($572 million after-tax) increased 10%. Income from the fixed income investment portfolio decreased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by a higher average level of fixed maturity investments.

Full Year 2020 Results

(All comparisons vs. full year 2019, unless noted otherwise)

Net income of $2.697 billion increased $75 million due to higher core income, partially offset by lower net realized investment gains. Core income of $2.686 billion increased by $149 million, primarily due to a higher underlying underwriting gain and net favorable prior year reserve development in the current year compared to net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the prior year, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and lower net investment income. The underlying underwriting gain benefited from higher business volumes and a lower underlying combined ratio. Catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses in 2020 were reduced by the full $280 million of recoveries available under the Company's 2020 Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty in the third quarter of 2020.

Income from the fixed income investment portfolio decreased from the prior year, primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by a higher average level of fixed maturity investments.

Business Insurance Segment Financial Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth Quarter 2020 Results

(All comparisons vs. fourth quarter 2019, unless noted otherwise)

Segment income for Business Insurance was $713 million after-tax, an increase of $265 million. Segment income increased primarily due to higher net favorable prior year reserve development, a higher underlying underwriting gain, lower catastrophe losses and higher net investment income. 

Combined ratio:

•The combined ratio of 89.8% improved 7.7 points due to higher net favorable prior year reserve development (3.0 points), a lower underlying combined ratio (2.8 points) and lower catastrophe losses (1.9 points).

5

•The underlying combined ratio of 93.6% improved by 2.8 points, impacted by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and the favorable comparison as a result of the re-estimation of losses in the prior year quarter related to the first three quarters of 2019. COVID-19 and related economic conditions had a modest net favorable impact on the underlying combined ratio. 

•Net favorable prior year reserve development was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the workers' compensation product line for multiple accident years, partially offset by an increase to general liability reserves in our run-off book related to policies issued more than 20 years ago. 

Net written premiums of $3.631 billion decreased 2%. The benefits of continued strong retention and higher renewal rate changes were more than offset by a modest reduction in exposures and a decrease in new business volume, both impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. 

Full Year 2020 Results

(All comparisons vs. full year 2019, unless noted otherwise)

Segment income for Business Insurance was $1.309 billion after-tax, a decrease of $83 million.

•The underlying combined ratio of 95.5% improved 0.7 points, impacted by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. COVID-19 and related economic conditions had a modest net unfavorable impact on the underlying combined ratio. 

•Net unfavorable prior year reserve development was primarily driven by the following: 

•Asbestos reserves - an increase of $295 million; 

•General liability (excluding asbestos and environmental) - higher than expected loss experience in the segment's domestic operations for primary and excess coverages for recent accident years, as well as an increase to general liability reserves in our run-off book related to policies issued more than 20 years ago; 

•Commercial automobile - higher than expected loss experience in the segment's domestic operations for recent accident years; and

•Commercial multi-peril (excluding PG&E subrogation recoveries and asbestos and environmental) - higher than expected loss experience in the segment's domestic operations for recent accident years.

Partially offset by: 

•Workers' compensation - better than expected loss experience in the segment's domestic operations for multiple accident years;

•Commercial property (excluding PG&E subrogation recoveries) - better than expected loss experience in the segment's domestic operations for multiple accident years; and 

•PG&E subrogation recoveries - $81 million of recoveries as described above.

•the impact of new or potential regulations imposed or to be imposed by the United States or other nations, including tariffs or other barriers to international trade; and

The Company cautions investors that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the Company’s control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.

Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: 

•high levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results 

11

of operations, its financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact the Company’s ratings, the Company’s ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance; 

•if actual claims exceed the Company’s claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates or the impacts of COVID-19, the Company’s financial results could be materially and adversely affected;

•the impact of COVID-19 and related risks, including on the Company's distribution or other key partners, could materially affect the Company's results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity;

•during or following a period of financial market disruption or an economic downturn, such as the current environment, the Company’s business could be materially and adversely affected; 

•the Company’s investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses, particularly in the current environment;

•the intense competition that the Company faces, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which it operates, could harm its ability to maintain or increase its business volumes and its profitability;

•the Company’s business could be harmed because of its potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation; 

•disruptions to the Company’s relationships with its independent agents and brokers or the Company's inability to manage effectively a changing distribution landscape could adversely affect the Company; 

•the Company is exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances; 

•the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the Company’s business are uncertain, and court decisions or legislative or regulatory changes that take place after the Company issues its policies, including those taken in response to COVID-19 (such as effectively expanding workers' compensation coverage by instituting presumptions of compensability of claims for certain types of workers or requiring insurers to cover business interruption claims irrespective of terms, exclusions or other conditions included in the policies that would otherwise preclude coverage), can result in an unexpected increase in the number of claims and have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations; 

•the Company may not be able to collect all amounts due to it from reinsurers, reinsurance coverage may not be available to the Company in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all and the Company is exposed to credit risk related to its structured settlements; 

•the Company is exposed to credit risk in certain of its insurance operations and with respect to certain guarantee or indemnification arrangements that it has with third parties, which risk is heightened in the current environment; 

•within the United States, the Company’s businesses are heavily regulated by the states in which it conducts business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes in regulation or regulatory actions (including those taken in response to COVID-19) may reduce the Company’s profitability and limit its growth;

•a downgrade in the Company’s claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact the Company’s business volumes, adversely impact the Company’s ability to access the capital markets and increase the Company’s borrowing costs;

•the inability of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company’s holding company in sufficient amounts would harm the Company’s ability to meet its obligations, pay future shareholder dividends and/or make future share repurchases;

•the Company’s efforts to develop new products, expand in targeted markets or improve business processes and workflows may not be successful and may create enhanced risks; 

•the Company may be adversely affected if its pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results;

•the Company’s business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology, particularly as its business processes become more digital; 

•if the Company experiences difficulties with technology, data and network security (including as a result of cyber attacks), outsourcing relationships or cloud-based technology, the Company’s ability to conduct its business could be negatively impacted. This risk is heightened in the current environment where a majority of the Company's employees have shifted to a work from home arrangement; 

•the Company is also subject to a number of additional risks associated with its business outside the United States, such as foreign currency exchange fluctuations (including with respect to the valuation of the 

12

Company’s foreign investments and interests in joint ventures) and restrictive regulations as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union;

•regulatory changes outside of the United States, including in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and the European Union, could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations and limit its growth;

•loss of or significant restrictions on the use of particular types of underwriting criteria, such as credit scoring, or other data or methodologies, in the pricing and underwriting of the Company’s products could reduce the Company’s future profitability;

•the Company’s businesses may be adversely affected if it is unable to hire and retain qualified employees;

•changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on the Company, and otherwise adversely impact the Company’s results;

•changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions where the Company operates could adversely impact the Company; and

•the Company’s share repurchase plans depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company’s desired ratings from independent rating agencies, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company’s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors, including the ongoing level of uncertainty related to COVID-19.

In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated financial statements or are not required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements or, in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures also follow.

In the opinion of the Company’s management, a discussion of these measures provides investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and other financial statement users with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company’s periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company’s financial performance. 

Some of these measures exclude net realized investment gains (losses), net of tax, and/or net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. 

Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the Company’s management.

RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO CORE INCOME AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-GAAP MEASURES

Core income (loss) is consolidated net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses), discontinued operations, the effect of a change in tax laws and tax rates at enactment, and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles when applicable. Segment income (loss) is determined in the same manner as core income (loss) on a segment basis. Management uses segment income (loss) to analyze each segment’s performance and as a tool in making business decisions. Financial statement users also consider core income (loss) when analyzing the results and trends of insurance companies. Core income (loss) per share is core income (loss) on a per common share basis.

RECONCILIATION OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY TO ADJUSTED SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND CALCULATION OF RETURN ON EQUITY AND CORE RETURN ON EQUITY

Adjusted shareholders’ equity is shareholders’ equity excluding net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, net realized investment gains (losses), net of tax, for the period presented, the effect of a change in tax laws and tax rates at enactment (excluding the portion related to net unrealized investment gains (losses)), preferred stock and discontinued operations. 

Reconciliation of Shareholders’ Equity to Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Return on equity is the ratio of annualized net income (loss) less preferred dividends to average shareholders’ equity for the periods presented. Core return on equity is the ratio of annualized core income (loss) less preferred dividends to adjusted average shareholders’ equity for the periods presented. In the opinion of the Company’s management, these are important indicators of how well management creates value for its shareholders through its operating activities and its capital management. 

Average shareholders’ equity is (a) the sum of total shareholders’ equity excluding preferred stock at the beginning and end of each of the quarters for the period presented divided by (b) the number of quarters in the period presented times two. Adjusted average shareholders’ equity is (a) the sum of total adjusted shareholders’ equity at the beginning and end of each of the quarters for the period presented divided by (b) the number of quarters in the period presented times two.

RECONCILIATION OF PRE-TAX UNDERWRITING GAIN EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS TO NET INCOME

Underwriting gain (loss) is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses. In the opinion of the Company’s management, it is important to measure the profitability of each segment excluding the results of investing activities, which are managed separately from the insurance business. This measure is used to assess each segment’s business performance and as a tool in making business decisions. Pre-tax underwriting gain, excluding the impact of catastrophes and net favorable (unfavorable) prior year loss reserve development, is the underwriting gain adjusted to exclude claims and claim adjustment expenses, reinstatement premiums and assessments related to catastrophes and loss reserve development related to time periods prior to the current year. In the opinion of the Company’s management, this measure is meaningful to users of the financial statements to understand the Company’s periodic earnings and the variability of earnings caused by the unpredictable nature (i.e., the timing and amount) of catastrophes and loss reserve development. This measure is also referred to as underlying underwriting margin or underlying underwriting gain.

A catastrophe is a severe loss designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount. Their effects are included in net and core income and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence. A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools. 

The Company’s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate threshold is applied for international business across all 

16

reportable segments. The threshold for 2020 ranges from approximately $20 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.

Net favorable (unfavorable) prior year loss reserve development is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims, which may be related to one or more prior years. In the opinion of the Company’s management, a discussion of loss reserve development is meaningful to users of the financial statements as it allows them to assess the impact between prior and current year development on incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses, net and core income (loss), and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.

COMBINED RATIO AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO

Combined ratio: For Statutory Accounting Practices (SAP), the combined ratio is the sum of the SAP loss and LAE ratio and the SAP underwriting expense ratio as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The combined ratio, as used in this earnings release, is the equivalent of, and is calculated in the same manner as, the SAP combined ratio except that the SAP underwriting expense ratio is based on net written premiums and the underwriting expense ratio as used in this earnings release is based on net earned premiums. 

For SAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses less certain administrative services fee income to net earned premiums as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The loss and LAE ratio as used in this earnings release is calculated in the same manner as the SAP ratio. 

For SAP, the underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred (including commissions paid), less certain administrative services fee income and billing and policy fees and other, to net written premiums as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The underwriting expense ratio as used in this earnings release, is the ratio of underwriting expenses (including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs), less certain administrative services fee income, billing and policy fees and other, to net earned premiums.

The combined ratio, loss and LAE ratio, and underwriting expense ratio are used as indicators of the Company’s underwriting discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business and overall underwriting profitability. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss.

Underlying combined ratio represents the combined ratio excluding the impact of net prior year reserve development and catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio is an indicator of the Company’s underwriting discipline and underwriting profitability for the current accident year.

Other companies’ method of computing similarly titled measures may not be comparable to the Company’s method of computing these ratios.

Calculation of the Combined Ratio

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) For purposes of computing ratios, billing and policy fees and other (which are a component of other revenues) are allocated as a reduction of underwriting expenses. In addition, fee income is allocated as a reduction of losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. In addition, G&A include non-insurance expenses that are excluded from underwriting expenses, and accordingly are excluded in calculating the combined ratio.

RECONCILIATION OF BOOK VALUE PER SHARE AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY TO CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES

Book value per share is total common shareholders’ equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per share is total common shareholders’ equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company’s management, adjusted book value per share is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company’s book value per share as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets (i.e., net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax), which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. Tangible book value per share is adjusted book value per share excluding the after-tax value of goodwill and other intangible assets divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company’s management, tangible book value per share is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company’s book value on a nominal basis as it removes certain effects of purchase accounting (i.e., goodwill and other intangible assets), in addition to the effect of changing prices on invested assets.

RECONCILIATION OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION EXCLUDING NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS, NET OF TAX

Total capitalization is the sum of total shareholders’ equity and debt. Debt-to-capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain on investments, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, is the ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the debt-to-capital ratio is useful in an analysis of the Company’s financial leverage.

OTHER DEFINITIONS

Gross written premiums reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract. Net written premiums reflect gross written premiums less premiums ceded to reinsurers. 

For Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance, retention is the amount of premium available for renewal that was retained, excluding rate and exposure changes. For Personal Insurance, retention is the ratio of the expected number of renewal policies that will be retained throughout the annual policy period to the number of available renewal base policies. For all of the segments, renewal rate change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, excluding exposure changes. Exposure is the measure of risk used in the pricing of an insurance product. The change in exposure is the amount of change in premium on policies that renew attributable to the change in portfolio risk. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes. New business is the amount of written premium related to new policyholders and additional products sold to existing policyholders. These are operating statistics, which are in part dependent on the use of estimates and are therefore subject to change. For Business Insurance, retention, renewal premium change and new business exclude National Accounts. For Bond & Specialty 

19

Insurance, retention, renewal premium change and new business exclude surety and other products that are generally sold on a non-recurring, project specific basis.

Statutory capital and surplus represents the excess of an insurance company’s admitted assets over its liabilities, including loss reserves, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. 

Holding company liquidity is the total funds available at the holding company level to fund general corporate purposes, primarily the payment of shareholder dividends and debt service.
