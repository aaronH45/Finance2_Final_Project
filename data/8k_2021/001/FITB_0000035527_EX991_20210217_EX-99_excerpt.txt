Exhibit 99.1  

FIFTH THIRD BANK, NATIONAL  

ASSOCIATION  

EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE BENEFITS PLAN  

AND  

SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION  

Effective February 17, 2021  

PURPOSE OF THE PLAN  

The purpose of the Fifth Third Bank, National Association Executive Severance Benefits Plan (“Plan”) is to provide severance pay benefits to eligible executive employees whose employment with Fifth Third Bank, National Association (the “Company”) is terminated involuntarily under the conditions described below.  

Except as provided herein or as otherwise provided by the Company in writing, this Plan (i) is the sole arrangement of the Company regarding severance-type benefits to eligible executives and (ii) replaces and supersedes all prior plans, programs, understandings and arrangements providing severance-type benefits to eligible executives (other than the CIC Severance Plan which remains in full force and effect).  

This document contains the official text of the Plan and serves as the summary plan description for the Plan.  

ELIGIBLE EXECUTIVES  

Participation in the Plan is limited to executive employees of the Company who, on or after the Effective Date, serve as a member of the Enterprise Committee and who execute the Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of (i) joining the Enterprise Committee or (ii) the Effective Date, whichever is later (“Participants”).  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following employees are NOT eligible to be Participants in this Plan:  

   (i)  

Any employee who has not served as a member of the Enterprise Committee following the Effective Date;  

   (ii)  

Any employee who fails to timely execute the Arbitration Agreement;  

   (iii)  

Any employee who is eligible to participate in another plan, policy or arrangement maintained by the Company or any of its affiliates which provides severance-type benefits unless such other plan, policy or arrangement provides that the employee will be eligible to receive benefits under this Plan, provided that eligibility to receive benefits under the CIC Severance Plan in connection with a termination of employment that occurs within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control does not make an employee ineligible to participate in this Plan; and  

   (iv)  

Any employee who is covered by an employment contract unless the contract provides that the employee will be eligible to receive benefits under this Plan.

The provisions of the Plan shall be construed, administered and enforced according to applicable federal law and, where appropriate, the laws of the State of Ohio without reference to its conflict of laws rules and without regard to any rule of any jurisdiction that would result in the application of the law of another jurisdiction.  

The parties expressly consent that any action or proceeding relating to this Plan or any release or other agreement entered into with respect to this Plan will be brought solely through binding arbitration as per the Arbitration Agreement.

STATEMENT OF ERISA RIGHTS  

As a Participant in this Plan you are entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides that all Plan Participants shall be entitled to:  

   •    

Receive Information About Your Plan and Benefits  

Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator’s office and at other specified locations all documents governing the plan and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) required to be filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.  

8   

Obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of the Plan and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series), if any required, and updated summary plan description. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies.  

   •    

Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries  

In addition to creating rights for Plan participants ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan. The people who operate your Plan, called “fiduciaries” of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.  

   •    

Enforce Your Rights  

If your claim for a severance benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.  

Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file an action through arbitration as per the Arbitration Agreement. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan’s money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file or you may file an action through arbitration as per the Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator will decide who should pay the arbitration costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the arbitrator may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the arbitrator may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous, except that the Company may not be awarded the fees which it is required to pay under the Arbitration Agreement.  

   •    

Assistance with Your Questions  

If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT AND GENERAL RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS  

THE EXECUTION OF THIS NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT AND GENERAL RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS (the “Agreement”) between FIFTH THIRD BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION and its parent corporation, successors, assigns, subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates (individually and collectively, the “Company”) and (“Executive”), is a condition of receiving severance benefits set forth in the Fifth Third Bank, National Association Executive Severance Benefits Plan (the “Plan”).  

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Executive and Company, its predecessors, officers and directors agree as follows:  

A. Severance Benefits. Executive’s employment will end as of [insert date] (the “Separation Date”). If Executive complies with the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, Executive will receive the severance benefits pursuant to the Plan and in compliance with all Plan terms as set forth below: [list benefits to be provided] (the “Severance Benefits”).  

Executive acknowledges and agrees that except for the Severance Benefits, Executive shall be entitled to no other wages, salary, vacation pay, bonuses, incentive awards, commissions, benefits, other severance benefits, whether under the Company’s Executive Change in Control Severance Plan (“ECICSP”) or otherwise, or other compensation of any kind, except as required by law. Executive further acknowledges and agrees that Executive would not receive the Severance Benefits, except for Executive’s execution of this Agreement and the fulfillment of the promises contained herein.  

B. Covenants. Executive acknowledges that during Executive’s employment with the Company Executive became familiar with the Company’s Confidential Information (as defined below) and that Executive’s services were of special and unique value to the Company. Executive understands and agrees that without employment by the Company, Executive would not have had access or exposure to this Confidential Information. Executive further understands and agrees that this Confidential Information and the Company’s development of and its relationships with customers take a long time to develop and are the product of substantial investment by the Company. Executive also understands and agrees that the Company has a legitimate and protectable interest in protecting the Confidential Information and the Company’s employees, customers, and other business relationships and that this Section B is intended to protect those interests. Additionally, Executive understands that in consideration for the right to receive Severance Benefits, Executive in turn agrees to the covenants set forth in this Section B and agrees that if Executive revokes pursuant to Section K of this Agreement, such revocation shall not apply to this Section B and the provisions in this Section B shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to their terms regardless of such revocation. Accordingly, in exchange for the right to receive Severance Benefits or the receipt of such Severance Benefits, each of which Executive acknowledges as independently sufficient consideration, and to preserve the interests of the Company in its clients, customers, and employees, Executive agrees to the covenants in this Section B.  

i   

1. Covenant Not to Use Confidential Information.  

a. As a necessary function of Executive’s employment with the Company, Executive had access to, used, received, and otherwise acquired various kinds of customer, business, and technical information relating to the Company’s business that is of a confidential nature to the Company, whether or not such information is specifically labeled as “confidential.” Executive agrees that such confidential information includes, for example, the following:  

Current, prospective and former customer names and information, including but not limited to contact, financial and account information; product information; compensation plans and arrangements, including incentive compensation plans; performance specifications; pricing, profit margin, and other financial information; product specifications; vendor information; Company training, reference and/or educational materials; Company forecasts/plans/pipelines; objectives and strategies; quality control and/or compliance standards; business referrals, suppliers, and customer lists; unpublished works of any nature whether or not copyrightable; business plans; Company research and/or development materials relating to the Company’s business; information contained in pending patent applications; inventions, technical improvements, and ideas; and all other information and knowledge in whatever form used or useful in management, marketing, purchasing, finance, or operations of the Company’s business and any compilation of such information and all other similar information used by the Company that is not available to those outside of the Company (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Confidential Information”).  

b. Executive also understands that Executive occupied a position of confidence and trust with respect to the Company’s Confidential Information during Executive’s employment. Executive acknowledges and agrees that such Confidential Information is the exclusive property of the Company, is not generally known outside of the Company, that the Company has taken measures to guard the secrecy of its Confidential Information, that such information is extremely valuable and an essential asset of the Company’s business, and that such information, if disclosed without authorization to a third party or used by Executive for purposes other than conducting the Company business would cause irreparable harm to the Company and/or its customers.  

c. Executive further agrees that Executive will not disclose or use, directly or indirectly, or authorize or permit anyone under Executive’s direction to disclose to anyone, any Confidential Information of the Company that Executive obtained during the course of Executive’s employment relating to or otherwise concerning the business of the Company, whether or not acquired, originated, or developed in whole or in part by Executive. Without limitation, Executive shall not use any Confidential Information to solicit any Company customer or employee to compete with the Company or in any other manner to compete with the Company.  

d. The obligations set forth herein shall not apply to any trade secrets or Confidential Information that has become generally known to competitors of the Company through no act or omission of Executive, nor shall the obligations set forth herein apply to disclosures made pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, Executive agrees that Executive will not compile pieces of information from several sources and assemble them together in any manner in an attempt to circumvent a violation of Executive’s confidentiality obligations to the Company or attempt to demonstrate thereby that any of the Confidential Information is in the public domain.  

e. Under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (a) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is  

ii   

 made to Executive’s attorney in relation to a lawsuit for retaliation against Executive for reporting a suspected violation of law; or (c) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.  

2. Covenant Prohibiting Competition and Solicitation of Customers. Confidential Information of the Company gained by Executive during employment is developed by the Company through substantial expenditures of time, effort, and financial resources, and constitutes valuable and unique property of the Company. Executive acknowledges, understands, and agrees that the foregoing makes it necessary for the protection of the Company’s business that Executive does not divert business of the Company’s customers from the Company and that Executive maintain the confidentiality and integrity of Confidential Information. Therefore, Executive agrees that for a period of one (1) year following the Separation Date:  

a. In any state, geographic region, or territory in which the Company operates, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, for Executive or any other individual or entity, as an employee, agent, consultant, director, equity holder, manager, co-partner or in any other individual or representative capacity, own, operate, manage, control, engage in, invest in, be employed by or participate in any manner in, act as a consultant or advisor to, otherwise assist, or render services for, any individual or entity rendering services or handling products competitive with the Company.  

Nothing herein shall prevent Executive from investing in an entity listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the over the counter market so long as Executive’s ownership interest in such entity does not exceed five percent (5%) of the equity of such entity.  

b. Executive shall not directly or indirectly, for Executive or any other individual or entity, solicit, contact, divert, entice or take away any customers, business or prospective business about whom Executive had knowledge, or with whom Executive had contact, involvement or responsibility during Executive’s employment with the Company, or attempt to do so for the sale of any product or service that competes with a product or service offered by the Company.  

c. Executive shall not directly or indirectly, for Executive or any other individual or entity, solicit, contact, divert, entice or take away any potential customer identified, selected or targeted by the Company about whom Executive had knowledge, or with whom Executive had contact, involvement or responsibility during Executive’s employment with the Company, or attempt to do so for the sale of any product or service that competes with a product or service offered by the Company.  

d. Executive shall not directly or indirectly accept or provide assistance in the accepting of (including, but not limited to, providing any service, information or assistance or other facilitation or other involvement) business or orders from customers or any potential customers of the Company about whom Executive had knowledge or with whom Executive had contact, involvement, or responsibility during Executive’s employment with the Company, or attempt to do so on behalf of any third party or otherwise for his or her own benefit.  

Nothing contained in this Section shall preclude Executive from accepting employment with or creating his or her own company, firm, or business that competes with the Company so long as those activities do not violate any of the terms of this Agreement.  

3. Covenant Prohibiting Solicitation of Employees. Executive agrees that for a period of one (1) year following the Separation Date, Executive shall not directly or indirectly solicit, recruit, induce, encourage, interview, hire or attempt to solicit, recruit induce, encourage, interview, or hire, directly or by assisting any other individual or entity, any employee or independent contractor of the Company, nor encourage any such employee or independent contractor to cease their relationship with the Company. Without limitation,

 Executive agrees not to engage in discussions with any officer, manager, employee, or independent contractor of the Company in an attempt to solicit, recruit, induce or encourage the individual to end his or her relationship with the Company, not to share any Company officer, manager, employee, or independent contractor’s name or contact information with any other person or entity so that the person or entity can speak to the Company’s officer, manager, employee, or independent contractor about potentially leaving the Company, and not to participate in any interviewing or hiring of a Company officer, manager, employee, or independent contractor.  

4. Non-Disparagement. Executive acknowledges, agrees, and covenants that Executive will not make any statements, comments, or communications that constitute disparagement of the Company and/or any Released Parties (as defined below) or that may be considered detrimental or injurious to the good name or business reputation of the Company and/or any Released Party. Nothing in this provision shall prevent Executive from testifying truthfully as required by law nor does this provision prohibit or prevent Executive from filing a charge with or participating, testifying, or assisting in any investigation, hearing, whistleblower proceeding or other proceeding before any federal, state, or local government agency.  

5. Other Provisions.  

a. Extension in The Event of Breach: Any period of violation of this Section B by Executive shall extend the term of this Agreement by the period of the breach.  

b. Severability: If, at the time of enforcement of this Section B, a court or arbitrator holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum duration, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court or arbitrator shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum duration, scope and area permitted by law. All provisions of this Section B not revised shall then survive according to their respective terms.  

c. Acknowledgments: Executive agrees that Executive has carefully read and considered the provisions of this Section B and, having done so, agrees and acknowledges that: (1) the covenants set forth in this Section B are reasonable in all respects, including, where applicable, geographical and temporal scope, and (2) as part of the offer of and requirements for Executive’s receipt of the Severance Benefits, the Company and Executive would not have entered into this Agreement but for Company’s and Executive’s covenants contained herein, and (3) the covenants contained herein have been made in order to induce the Company and Executive to enter into this Agreement. Executive also acknowledges that the provisions of this Section B were and are in consideration of good and valuable consideration as set forth in this Agreement. In addition, Executive agrees and acknowledges that none of the restrictions contained in this Section B preclude Executive from earning a livelihood, nor do they unreasonably impose limitations on Executive’s ability to earn a living. Executive further agrees and acknowledges that the potential harm to the Company of the non-enforcement of any provision of this Section B outweighs any potential harm to Executive of its enforcement by injunction or otherwise. Finally, Executive is in full accord with the provisions of this Section B as to their necessity for the reasonable and proper protection of Confidential Information of the Company.  

d. Notice: Executive agrees that Executive will advise any individual or entity with which Executive may be engaged as an employee, agent, consultant, director, equity holder, manager, co-partner, owner, operator, manager, consultant, or advisor of: (1) Executive’s obligations contained in this Section B; and (2) any of Executive’s prior obligations prohibiting the use, possession, and dissemination of confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret protected information. Such notice by Executive shall not be a violation of the confidentiality provisions included in this Agreement.  

iv   

e. Obligation to Comply with Other Laws: The duties Executive owes the Company under this Agreement shall be deemed to include federal, state and common law obligations of employees to their employers. This Agreement is intended, amongst other things, to supplement the provisions of state trade secret law and duties Executive owes the Company under common law, including but not limited to the duty of loyalty, and does not in any way supersede any of the obligations or duties Executive otherwise owes the Company.  

f. Attorney’s Fees: If the Company must enforce any of its rights under this Agreement through legal proceedings, Executive agrees to reimburse the Company for all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney’s fees incurred by it in connection with the enforcement of its rights.  

g. Injunctive Relief: Executive acknowledges that should Executive violate any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Company will suffer irreparable harm and not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, as set forth in Section D below, Executive agrees that the Company may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing, seek specific performance or injunctive relief to restrain or prevent any such violation, as well as all equitable relief, in a court of competent jurisdiction, without posting a bond or other security.  

h. Relationship with Other Agreements: The covenants contained in this Section B shall fully supersede and replace any previous obligations imposed upon Executive by agreements entered into between Executive and the Company as they relate to Executive’s postemployment competition or solicitation of customers and/or employees. For the sake of clarity, if Executive’s employment ended by reason of Retirement as defined in in the Long Term Incentive Award Overview or for any other reason, the Company does not consent to Executive acting in any manner or taking any action that would violate this Section B, including but not limited to, Executive becoming an employee or director of, or a consultant to or advisor to, another financial institution in violation of this Section B. However, any prior obligations prohibiting the use, possession, and dissemination of confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret protected information (the “Prior Confidentiality Covenants”) shall remain in full force and effect.  

C. Release of Claims. In exchange for good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which Executive agrees, Executive hereby releases, forever discharges, and covenants not to sue in court or to bring a claim for arbitration against Fifth Third Bank, National Association, its parent corporation, affiliates, subsidiaries, divisions, predecessors, insurers, successors and assigns, and their current and former employees, attorneys, officers, directors and agents thereof, both individually and in their business capacities, and their employee benefit plans and programs and their administrators and fiduciaries (collectively referred to throughout the remainder of this Agreement as “Released Parties” or “Released Party”) of and from any and all claims, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, complaints, charges, contracts, judgments, damages, liabilities, demands, and attorneys’ fees known and unknown, asserted or unasserted against any Released Party, which Executive ever had, now has or which Executive or Executive’s heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns may have as of the date of execution of this Agreement, due to any matter whatsoever relating to Executive’s employment, compensation, benefits and/or termination of Executive’s employment, (collectively, the “Released Claims”).

vi   

 affected this Agreement. Nevertheless, Executive hereby waives any right, claim or cause of action that might arise as a result of such different or additional claims or facts.  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this release does not include any rights that Executive cannot lawfully waive and does not include any rights Executive may have to: (a) Executive’s own vested accrued employee benefits under the Company’s qualified retirement benefit plans as of the Separation Date; (b) benefits and/or the right to seek benefits under applicable workers’ compensation and/or unemployment compensation statutes; (c) pursue claims which by law cannot be waived by signing this Agreement; (d) enforce this Agreement; and/or (e) challenge the validity of this Agreement.  

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall interfere with Executive’s rights to challenge the Company’s compliance with the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall interfere with Executive’s right to exercise rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”), or to file a charge or complaint with, or participate or cooperate in an investigation or proceeding conducted by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or any other federal, or comparable state or local government agency or commission (“Government Agencies”); such agencies and commissions have the authority to carry out their statutory duties by investigating a charge, issuing a determination, filing a lawsuit, or taking any other action authorized by law. Executive retains the right to participate in such actions and retain the right to communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in, testify, or assist in any investigation, hearing, whistleblower proceeding or other proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agencies, including providing documents or other information without notice to the Company and such communication shall not be limited by any provision of this Agreement, including without limitation the: non-disclosure of confidential information, cooperation, breach of employee covenants, confidentiality or non-disparagement provisions herein. This Agreement does not limit Executive’s right to receive an award or benefit for information provided to a Government Agency as a whistleblower under any government-administered whistleblower award program; however, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Executive agrees that Executive shall not be entitled to recover any individual monetary damages or relief or other individual remedies with respect to any non-whistleblower claim. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this Agreement limits Executive’s right to receive an award for information provided to the SEC.  

If any claim is not subject to release, Executive waives, to the extent permitted by law, any right or ability to be a class or collective action representative or to otherwise participate in any putative or certified class, collective or multiparty action or proceeding based on such a claim in which the Company or any other Released Party is a party.  

D. Dispute Resolution. Executive and Company agree that any dispute, breach or alleged breach arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Executive’s employment with or separation from the Company shall be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to the Plan and to the Executive Severance Benefits Plan Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate (the “Arbitration Agreement”). Nothing in this Section shall affect or limit in any way either party’s right to resort to a court for emergency equitable relief in the form of a temporary restraining order or other similar temporary equitable remedy to preserve the status quo pending an arbitration for breach or threatened breach of any restrictive covenants included in Section B and misappropriation or threatened misappropriation of the Company’s trade secrets or breach of the confidentiality or non-disparagement promises in this Agreement. Once a decision is made on any motion for temporary equitable relief to preserve the status quo on such claims, the remainder of the dispute will be resolved through arbitration pursuant to the Plan and the Arbitration Agreement.  

vii   

E. Governing Law and Interpretation. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not individual state laws regarding enforcement of arbitration agreements. With respect to matters not governed by the FAA, this Agreement shall be governed by and shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of Ohio without regard to its conflict of laws provision.  

F. Cooperation. Executive also agrees that if requested by the Company, Executive will reasonably cooperate with the Company and provide information and assistance to the Company that relates to Executive’s work conducted on behalf of the Company. Such assistance shall include, but not be limited to providing the Company or Compliance Officer or their designees all of Executive’s operational, institutional and business knowledge and all of the customer and contractual information known by Executive that relate to the performance of Executive’s duties for the Company. Executive shall further reasonably cooperate in connection with any internal investigation, the defense or prosecution of any claim that may be made against or by the Company, or in connection with any ongoing or future investigation or dispute or claim of any kind involving the Company, including any proceeding, civil or criminal, before any arbitral, administrative, judicial, legislative, regulatory or self-regulatory or other body or agency, including providing truthful testimony in or in connection with any proceeding. Executive further agrees to perform all reasonable acts and to execute and deliver any documents that may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Section F of this Agreement. The Company will provide Executive with reasonable advance notice of its desire to request Executive’s cooperation. The Company will seek to minimize interruptions to Executive’s schedule to the extent consistent with its interests in the matter and reimburse Executive for all reasonable and appropriate out-of-pocket expenses Executive incurs in connection with providing such cooperation upon reasonable substantiation of such expenses.  

G. Confidentiality. Executive affirms that Executive has not divulged any Confidential Information of the Company and will continue not to disclose and maintain the confidentiality of such information consistent with applicable law, Company policies, this Agreement, and the Prior Confidentiality Covenants. Executive also affirms that Executive has not disclosed and agrees that Executive will not disclose any information regarding the underlying facts leading up to or the existence or substance of this Agreement, except to Executive’s immediate family whom Executive has instructed to not divulge such information, tax advisor or attorney with whom Executive chose to consult regarding Executive’s consideration of this Agreement, and/or to any federal, state, or local government agency and/or as may be required pursuant to legal process. Executive further agrees to take reasonable steps to ensure that any information concerning this Agreement which is disclosed to Executive’s tax advisor, attorney or immediate family will not be disclosed to any other third party, including but not limited to informing such persons that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are strictly confidential and that they may not be disclosed or discussed with anyone. However, nothing in this Section shall be interpreted, construed, asserted or enforced to prohibit or restrict in any way either of the parties from: (1) communicating with or otherwise participating in an investigation by an federal, state or local government law enforcement agency, including but not limited to the EEOC, NLRB, Department of Justice, SEC, Congress, or any Inspector General about or into the possible violate of any law or making disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation; (2) taking any other actions (with or without notification to the Company that are protected under the anti-retaliation provisions of state or federal law or regulation; or (3) making any statement that is compelled by a lawful court order, such as a valid subpoena for testimony.

L. Consequence of Breach by Executive. Executive acknowledges that the Company is entering this Agreement in reliance on Executive’s promises, agreements, warranties, and covenants to adhere to each of the obligations of this Agreement, and that the promises, agreements, warranties, covenants, duties, responsibilities and obligations set forth in each Section of this Agreement each constitute a material inducement for the Company to enter this Agreement.

Q. Severability. The Company and Executive agree that, should any provision of this Agreement be declared illegal or unenforceable by any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction and cannot be modified to be enforceable, excluding the general release language, such provision shall immediately become null and void, leaving the remainder of this Agreement in full force and effect.
