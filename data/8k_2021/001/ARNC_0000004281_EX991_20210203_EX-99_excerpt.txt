PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 3, 2021--Howmet Aerospace (NYSE:HWM) today reported fourth quarter 2020 and full year 2020 results. The Company reported fourth quarter revenues of $1.2 billion, down 29% year over year due to disruptions in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, primarily driven by COVID-19 and Boeing 737 MAX production declines, partially offset by growth in the defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. Fourth quarter 2020 revenues increased 9% sequentially from the third quarter 2020.  

 Howmet Aerospace reported income from continuing operations of $106 million, or $0.24 per share, in the fourth quarter 2020 versus income from continuing operations of $118 million, or $0.27 per share, in the fourth quarter 2019. Income from continuing operations excluding special items was $92 million, or $0.21 per share, in the fourth quarter 2020, versus $164 million, or $0.37 per share, in the fourth quarter 2019. Income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter 2020 included a $14 million benefit from special items, principally related to plant fire insurance proceeds and tax related items, partially offset by restructuring and other charges.  

 Full year 2020 income from continuing operations was $211 million, or $0.48 per share, versus income from continuing operations of $126 million, or $0.27 per share, in the full year 2019. Full year income from continuing operations excluding special items was $354 million, or $0.80 per share ($0.77 per share including pre-separation allocations), versus $590 million, or $1.29 per share, in the full year 2019. Income from continuing operations in full year 2020 included a $143 million charge from special items, principally related to separation costs and charges associated with cost reduction initiatives.  

 Fourth quarter 2020 operating income was $221 million, down 22% year over year. Operating income excluding special items was $215 million, down 28% year over year. The year-over-year decline was due to significant disruptions in the commercial aerospace market, driven by COVID-19 and Boeing 737 MAX and 787 production declines, and the commercial transportation market, driven by COVID-19, resulting in unfavorable volume and product mix. The decline was partially offset by growth in the defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets, variable and fixed cost reductions, and favorable product pricing. Operating income margin, excluding special items, was up approximately 20 basis points year over year to 17.4%.  

 Full year 2020 operating income was $626 million versus $579 million in the full year 2019. Operating income excluding special items for full year 2020 was $809 million ($814 million including pre-separation allocations), versus $1,199 million in the full year 2019. The year-over-year decline was due to significant disruptions in the commercial aerospace market, driven by COVID-19 and Boeing 737 MAX and 787 production declines, and the commercial transportation market, driven by COVID-19, resulting in unfavorable volume and product mix. The decline was partially offset by growth in the defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets, variable and fixed cost reductions, and favorable product pricing.  

 Howmet Aerospace Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer John Plant said, “Howmet Aerospace continued to manage effectively through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While fourth quarter 2020 revenues declined 29% year over year, driven by a 51% reduction in commercial aerospace revenues, results surpassed our outlook and included strong cash generation. We generated improved decremental margins, and our fourth quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8% was the same as the fourth quarter 2019 despite the 29% revenue decline and unfavorable commercial aerospace mix. We continue to be highly focused on all aspects of operational performance and cash generation as we manage through the effects of COVID-19 and the Boeing build rate reductions on commercial aerospace.”  

 Mr. Plant continued, “Turning to 2021, our defense aerospace, commercial transportation, and industrial gas turbine markets continue to be healthy and growing. Commercial aerospace has less visibility, though we expect increased aircraft build as we move into 2022. We are positioning the Company to emerge from the pandemic in a stronger, more profitable position.”  

 “Our liquidity position is strong as a result of our strict and disciplined approach to costs and spending. We ended 2020 with approximately $1.6 billion of cash. Our $1 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn and our next significant debt maturity is not until October 2024.”  

 Howmet Aerospace ended the year with a cash balance of approximately $1.6 billion. For the second quarter 2020 through fourth quarter 2020, cash provided from operations was $217 million; cash used for financing activities was $1.5 billion; and cash provided from investing activities was $260 million. Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the second quarter 2020 through the fourth quarter 2020 was $487 million, inclusive of an approximate $80 million reduction in our accounts receivable securitization program, $70 million impact from voluntary pension contributions, $46 million of cash severance payments, and $45 million tax refund.  

 On April 1, 2020, Arconic Inc. completed the separation of its business into two independent, publicly-traded companies: Howmet Aerospace Inc. (the new name for Arconic Inc.) and Arconic Corporation. The financial results of Arconic Corporation for all periods prior to April 1, 2020 have been retrospectively reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods prior to April 1, 2020. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with Arconic Corporation in the December 31, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations. The cash flows, comprehensive income, and equity related to Arconic Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income, and Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity, respectively, for all periods prior to April 1, 2020.

 2021 Outlook*   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Howmet Aerospace has not provided reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted earnings per share or earnings per share excluding special items, and adjusted free cash flow, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Such reconciliations are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from the non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes, and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume. Howmet Aerospace believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.  

 Achieved $197 million of cost reductions in full year 2020  

 In response to the significant market disruptions associated with COVID-19, Howmet Aerospace commenced plans in March 2020 to reduce costs. The Company achieved $197 million of cost reductions in full year 2020, above its outlook of $185 million. This structural cost reduction is in addition to the flexing of variable costs.  

 Repurchased $22 Million of Common Stock in the Fourth Quarter 2020; $277 Million Authorization Remains  

 During the fourth quarter 2020, the Company repurchased 0.9 million shares of its common stock for $22 million. During the full year 2020, Howmet Aerospace repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $73 million. $277 million remains available under prior authorization by the Board of Directors for share repurchases. Total common shares outstanding as of the end of December were approximately 433 million. Repurchases will be subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. The share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or terminated at any time without prior notice.

 (3)       During the second quarter of 2020, a $16 tax adjustment was identified related to periods prior to 2018. Although management has determined it was not material to any periods, it was corrected as an adjustment to Retained Earnings (Accumulated Deficit) and Deferred income taxes. The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 reflects the revision for such tax item.

 (1)       The use of cash from financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to the repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 6.15% Convertible Notes of approximately $2,040. These items were partially offset by long-term debt issuance of $2,400 (of which $1,200 went with Arconic Corporation at Separation).    

 (2)       During the third quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company identified a misclassification in the presentation of changes in accounts payable and capital expenditures in its previously issued Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. Although management has determined that such misclassification did not materially misstate such prior financial statements, the Company has revised its Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 resulting in an increase of $55 to previously reported capital expenditures within cash provided from investing activities with a corresponding offset in accounts payable, trade within cash used for operations.

 The net cash funding from the sale of accounts receivables was $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The net cash funding from the sale of accounts receivables was $329 million in the first quarter of 2020 which represented a $21 million use of cash in the first quarter. The net cash funding from the sale of accounts receivables was $299 million in the second quarter of 2020 which represented a $30 million use of cash in the second quarter. The net cash funding from the sale of accounts receivables was $255 million in the third quarter of 2020 which represented a $45 million use of cash in the third quarter. The net cash funding from the sale of accounts receivables was $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 which represented a $5 million use of cash in the fourth quarter.  

 During the third quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company identified a misclassification in the presentation of changes in accounts payable and capital expenditures in its previously issued Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. Although management has determined that such misclassification did not materially misstate such prior financial statements, the Company has revised its Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 resulting in an increase of $55 to previously reported capital expenditures within cash provided from investing activities with a corresponding offset in accounts payable, trade within cash used for operations.  

 Adjusted free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow, excluding costs associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures (due to the fact that these expenditures are considered necessary to maintain and expand the Company's asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations), cash receipts from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables, as well as costs associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction. It is important to note that Adjusted free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow, excluding costs associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure.

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Income from continuing operations excluding Special items, Income from continuing operations excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments, Diluted EPS excluding Special items and Diluted EPS excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the Company excluding the impacts of Restructuring and other charges, Discrete tax items, and Other special items (collectively, “Special items”). In addition, management believes that the Income from continuing operations excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments and Diluted EPS excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments are meaningful to investors as it reflects how management reviewed the standalone costs of Howmet in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 as if the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction had happened on January 1, 2020. There can be no assurances that additional special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Income (loss) from continuing operations determined under GAAP as well as Income (loss) from continuing operations excluding Special items.

 Operational tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the Company excluding the impacts of Special items. There can be no assurances that additional Special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both the Effective tax rate determined under GAAP as well as the Operational tax rate.

 Operating income excluding Special items, Operating income excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments, and Operating income margin, excluding Special items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the Company excluding the impacts of Special items. In addition, management believes that the Operating income excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments are meaningful to investors as it reflects how management reviewed the standalone costs of Howmet in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 as if the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction had happened on January 1, 2020. There can be no assurances that additional Special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Operating income determined under GAAP as well as Operating income excluding Special items.

 Adjustments include differences between allocations as required under discontinued operations as part of generally accepted accounting principles and estimated actual spending in selling, general, administrative, and other expenses related to Howmet on a standalone basis as if the Arconic Inc.
