Duke Energy reports fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results 

▪2020 reported EPS of $1.72 and adjusted EPS of $5.12, closing year at midpoint of updated guidance range

▪Constructive regulatory settlements in North Carolina and Florida provide clarity as clean energy transformation accelerates

▪$2.05 billion minority investment in Duke Energy Indiana by GIC displaces all common equity needs in five-year plan and supports investment plan to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050

▪Affirmed 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.00 to $5.30 with $5.15 midpoint and long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025, off 2021 midpoint

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today announced 2020 full-year reported EPS of $1.72, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and adjusted EPS of $5.12. This is compared to reported and adjusted EPS of $5.06, for the full-year 2019. 

Adjusted EPS excludes the impact of certain items that are included in reported EPS. The difference between full-year 2020 reported and adjusted EPS was primarily due to charges resulting from the cancellation of ACP and the coal ash settlement in North Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.

Adjusted results for 2020 were higher primarily driven by rate case contributions in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segments, complemented by growth from new renewables projects in the Commercial Renewables segment. Further, Duke Energy incurred lower O&M driven through substantial cost control efforts. These items were partially offset by impacts of the pandemic, including lower volumes and incremental expenses, mild weather, higher storm costs, the loss of ACP earnings and higher depreciation, amortization and property taxes on a growing asset base.

“I am very proud of our 2020 results — Duke Energy delivered for investors, customers and communities and these results reflect the strong commitment of our employees to work through challenges and serve our customers with excellence,” said Lynn Good, Duke Energy’s chair, president and chief executive officer. “Our strategy is clear — creating a clean energy future for our customers and communities. Underpinned by our robust $59 billion capital plan, as well as the significant progress on regulatory matters and strategic transactions during 2020

and early 2021, we are confidently affirming our growth rate of 5 to 7% based off of the 2021 adjusted EPS midpoint of $5.15.”

Quarterly results

Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2020 reported loss per share was $(0.12), primarily reflecting the impact of the coal ash settlement in North Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. This compared to reported EPS of $0.88 for the fourth quarter of 2019. Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2020 adjusted EPS was $1.03, compared to $0.91 for the fourth quarter of 2019. Higher adjusted results for the quarter compared to last year were driven by similar items as the year-to-date variance described in the preceding section.

In addition to the following summary of fourth quarter 2020 business segment performance, comprehensive tables with detailed EPS drivers for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 compared to prior year are provided at the end of this news release.

The discussion below of fourth quarter results includes both GAAP segment income and adjusted segment income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tables at the end of this news release present a full reconciliation of GAAP reported results to adjusted results. 

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure

On a reported basis, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2020 segment loss of $(170) million, compared to segment income of $592 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fourth quarter 2020 reported results included impacts of the coal ash settlement in North Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.

On an adjusted basis, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2020 segment income of $675 million, compared to $584 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $0.12 per share, excluding share dilution of $0.01 per share. Higher quarterly results were primarily driven by contributions from rate cases (+$0.12 per share) and lower O&M (+$0.09 per share). Lower O&M is driven by lower employee-related expenses, operational efficiencies and other cost control efforts, partially offset by higher storm costs and pandemic related costs, net of deferrals.

These results were partially offset by lower rider results primarily due to the absence of a prior year favorable energy efficiency order (-$0.05 per share) and higher depreciation, amortization and property taxes on a growing asset base (-$0.05 per share).

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure

On a reported basis, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2020 segment income of $134 million, compared to $140 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition to the drivers outlined below, lower fourth quarter 2020 results were due to costs related to the cancellation of ACP. These charges were treated as special items and excluded from adjusted earnings. 

Duke Energy News Release 3

On an adjusted basis, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2020 segment income of $150 million, compared to $159 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $0.01 per share. Lower quarterly results were driven by the loss of ACP earnings (-$0.05 per share), partially offset by contributions from the Piedmont North Carolina rate case (+$0.03 per share) and other retail margin (+$0.01 per share).

Commercial Renewables

On a reported and adjusted basis, Commercial Renewables recognized fourth quarter 2020 segment income of $79 million, compared to $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. This represents an increase of $0.03 per share. Higher quarterly results were primarily driven by new renewable projects (+$0.03 per share).

Other

Other primarily includes interest expense on holding company debt, other unallocated corporate costs and results from Duke Energy’s captive insurance company.

On a reported and adjusted basis, Other recognized a fourth quarter 2020 net loss of $127 million, compared to a net loss of $124 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $0.01 per share. 

Effective tax rate

Duke Energy's consolidated reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 50.8% compared to 13.4% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to charges as part of the coal ash settlement in North Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes.

The effective tax rate including impacts of noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 11.1% compared to the effective tax rate including impacts of noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items of 12.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes.

The tables at the end of this news release present a reconciliation of the reported effective tax rate to the effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items.

Duke Energy News Release 5

Non-GAAP financial measures

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and effective tax rate including impacts of noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items. Adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS represent income (loss) from continuing operations available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders in dollar and per share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. The effective tax rate including impacts of noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items is calculated using pretax earnings and income tax expense, both as adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests, preferred dividends and special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. 

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and effective tax rate including impacts of noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items are Net Income (Loss) Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP reported earnings (loss)), Basic earnings (loss) per share Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP reported earnings (loss) per share), and the reported effective tax rate, respectively. 

Special items included in the periods presented include the following items, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:

•Gas Pipeline Investments represents costs related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline and additional exit costs related to Constitution.

•Regulatory Settlements represents charges related to Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress coal ash settlement and the partial settlements in the 2019 North Carolina rate cases. 

•Severance represents the reversal of 2018 Severance charges, which were deferred as a result of a partial settlement in the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 2019 North Carolina rate cases.

•Impairment Charges in 2019 represents a reduction of a prior year impairment at Citrus County CC and an other-than-temporary impairment of the remaining investment in Constitution. 

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted earnings guidance, information to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to project all special items for future periods (such as legal settlements, the impact of regulatory orders or asset impairments).

Duke Energy News Release 6

Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income (loss) and other net loss. Segment income (loss) is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income (loss) includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Management also uses adjusted segment income (loss) as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment performance. Adjusted segment income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it is based upon segment income (loss) adjusted for special items, which are discussed above. Management believes the presentation of adjusted segment income (loss) provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment’s performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment income or adjusted other net loss is segment income (loss) and other net loss.

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted segment income or adjusted other net loss and any related growth rates for future periods, information to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not available at this time, as the company is unable to forecast all special items, as discussed above. 

Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.
