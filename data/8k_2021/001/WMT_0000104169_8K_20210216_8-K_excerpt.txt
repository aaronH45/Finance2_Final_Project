Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

On February 16, 2021, Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) completed the sale of the outstanding shares of Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), which was Walmart’s retail business in the United Kingdom. Walmart recognized a non-cash loss of approximately $5.7 billion, after tax, in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, when the business met the held for sale accounting criteria. The loss includes the loss on sale as well as the loss associated with the derecognition of the Asda pension plan. Walmart expects earnings per share dilution from the sale of approximately $0.20 in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022, primarily reflecting the absence of net income associated with the Asda business, assuming we hold transaction proceeds in cash. 

Walmart considers the foregoing statements regarding the estimated earnings per share dilution related to this transaction to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended (the “Act”), that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Act. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors.

In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise be subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, the Exchange Act, or the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document.

SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
