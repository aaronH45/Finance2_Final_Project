sheet and financial flexibility remains a key priority, and the action by our Board announced today to increase our dividend further speaks to confidence in the forward trajectory of our company. While visibility into the full year remains challenging, due to exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, we fully expect to return to positive organic growth over the course of the year, and to post full-year 2021 growth consistent with the industry, on top of IPG’s 2020 outperformance relative to our peer group. Along with that growth, we expect to continue to build on our long-term record of improving profitability and sustained value creation.”

For the full year 2020, salaries and related expenses were $5.35 billion, a decrease of 4.0% compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by reductions in base salaries, benefits and tax and lower incentive and temporary help expenses in response to the declines in net revenue, which were primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions. The decreases were partially offset by increased severance expense.

For the fourth quarter and full year 2020, office and other direct expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 16.0% and 17.0%, respectively, from 17.3% and 18.1%, respectively, for the same periods in 2019.

For the full year 2020, office and other direct expenses were $1.37 billion, a decrease of 12.5% compared to 2019. The decrease in office and other direct expenses was mainly due to decreases in travel and entertainment expenses and new business and promotion expenses as well as lower occupancy expense and professional consulting fees, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense.

For the fourth quarter of 2020, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 1.0%, which remained flat compared to the same period in 2019.

2019. For the full year 2020, selling, general and administrative expenses were $58.8 million, a decrease of 37.3% compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in employee insurance expense, resulting from fewer insurance claims as well as lower incentive expense and travel and entertainment expenses.

For the fourth quarter and full year 2020, depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net revenue was 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 3.2%, respectively, for the same periods in 2019.

During the fourth quarter and full year 2020, restructuring charges were $253.9 million and $413.8 million, respectively, due to actions taken, with the objective of lowering our operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and accelerating the transformation of our business.
