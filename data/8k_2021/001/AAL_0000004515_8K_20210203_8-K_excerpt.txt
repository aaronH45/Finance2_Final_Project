On February 3, 2021, American Airlines, Inc. (“American”), a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group Inc. (the “Company”), informed its employees that on February 5, 2021, it will begin to send Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (“WARN”) notices to approximately 13,000 U.S.-based employees. These WARN notices, which may be required by law in advance of potential furloughs in certain locations, are part of American’s response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business. As of the date hereof and based on current facts, American expects that any job impact will take effect on or after April 1, 2021.

At this time, the Company is unable to make a good faith determination of an estimate or range of estimates required by paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Item 2.05 of Form 8-K with respect to workforce reduction actions in the remainder of 2021. The Company will file an amendment to this report or provide an update in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q after it makes a determination of such estimate or range of estimates, if any.

ITEM 7.01.REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.

As discussed above, on February 3, 2021, American distributed a letter to employees regarding the possibility of a workforce reduction at certain locations. This internal communication is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference into this Item 7.01.

The information in Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
