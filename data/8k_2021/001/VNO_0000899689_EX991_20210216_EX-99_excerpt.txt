COVID-19 Pandemic 

Our business has been adversely affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures taken to curb the spread of the virus. Some of the effects on us include the following:

•With the exception of grocery stores and other "essential" businesses, many of our retail tenants closed their stores in March 2020 and began reopening when New York City entered phase two of its reopening plan on June 22, 2020, however, there continue to be limitations on occupancy and other restrictions that affect their ability to resume full operations.

•While our buildings remain open, many of our office tenants are working remotely.

•We have closed the Hotel Pennsylvania. In connection with the closure, we accrued $9,246,000 of severance for furloughed Hotel Pennsylvania union employees and recognized a corresponding $3,145,000 income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020.

•We cancelled trade shows at theMART from late March through the remainder of 2020 and expect to resume in 2021. 

•Because certain of our development projects were deemed "non-essential," they were temporarily paused in March 2020 due to New York State executive orders and resumed once New York City entered phase one of its state mandated reopening plan on June 8, 2020.

•As of April 30, 2020, we placed 1,803 employees on furlough, which included 1,293 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC ("BMS"), 414 employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania and 96 corporate staff employees. As of February 10, 2021, 50% of furloughed employees have returned to work. The remaining employees still on furlough are from BMS and the Hotel Pennsylvania.

•Effective April 1, 2020, our executive officers waived portions of their annual base salary for the remainder of 2020. 

•Effective April 1, 2020, each non-management member of our Board of Trustees agreed to forgo their $75,000 annual cash retainer for the remainder of 2020.

While we believe our tenants are required to pay rent under their leases and we have commenced legal proceedings against certain tenants that have failed to pay rent under their leases, in limited circumstances, we have agreed to and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and rent abatements for certain of our tenants. We have made a policy election in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Q&A which provides relief in accounting for leases during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing us to continue recognizing rental revenue on a straight-line basis for rent deferrals, with no impact to revenue recognition, and to recognize rent abatements as a reduction to rental revenue in the period granted.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we collected 95% (97% including rent deferrals) of rent due from our tenants, comprised of 97% (99% including rent deferrals) from our office tenants and 88% (89% including rent deferrals) from our retail tenants. Rent deferrals generally require repayment in monthly installments over a period not to exceed twelve months.

Based on our assessment of the probability of rent collection of our lease receivables, we have written off $1,401,000 and $51,571,000 of receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively, including the JCPenney retail lease at Manhattan Mall and the New York & Company, Inc. office lease at 330 West 34th Street. Both tenants have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and rejected their leases during 2020. In addition, we have written off $1,360,000 and $22,546,000 of tenant receivables deemed uncollectible for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively. These write-offs resulted in a reduction of lease revenues and our share of income from partially owned entities. Prospectively, revenue recognition for tenant receivables deemed uncollectible will be based on actual amounts received.

In light of the evolving health, social, economic, and business environment, governmental regulation or mandates, and business disruptions that have occurred and may continue to occur, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition and operating results remains highly uncertain but has been and may continue to be material. The impact on us includes lower rental income and potentially lower occupancy levels at our properties which will result in less cash flow available for operating costs, to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our shareholders. During 2020, we experienced a decrease in cash flow from operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced collections of rents billed to certain of our tenants, the closure of Hotel Pennsylvania, the cancellation of trade shows at theMART, and lower revenues from BMS and signage. In addition, we recognized $409,060,000 of non-cash impairment losses, net of noncontrolling interests, related to our investment in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV which are included in “(loss) income from partially owned entities” and $236,286,000 of non-cash impairment losses primarily on wholly owned retail assets which are included in “impairment losses and transaction related costs, net” on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The value of our real estate assets may continue to decline, which may result in additional non-cash impairment charges in future periods and that impact could be material.

Financings:

On February 28, 2020, we increased our unsecured term loan balance to $800,000,000 (from $750,000,000) by exercising an accordion feature. Pursuant to an existing swap agreement, $750,000,000 of the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.87% through October 2023, and the balance of $50,000,000 floats at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.00% (1.15% as of December 31, 2020). The entire $800,000,000 will float thereafter for the duration of the loan through February 2024. 

On August 12, 2020, we amended the $700,000,000 mortgage loan on 770 Broadway, a 1.2 million square foot Manhattan office building, to extend the term one year through March 2022.

On September 14, 2020, Alexander's, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) ("Alexander's"), in which we have a 32.4% ownership interest, amended and extended the $350,000,000 mortgage loan on the retail condominium of 731 Lexington Avenue. Under the terms of the amendment, Alexander's paid down the loan by $50,000,000 to $300,000,000, extended the maturity date to August 2025 and guaranteed the interest payments and certain leasing costs. The principal of the loan is non-recourse to Alexander's. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 1.40% (1.55% as of December 31, 2020) which has been swapped to a fixed rate of 1.72%.

 On October 15, 2020, we completed a $500,000,000 refinancing of PENN11, a 1.2 million square foot Manhattan office building. The interest-only loan carries a rate of LIBOR plus 2.75% (2.90% as of December 31, 2020) and matures in October 2025, as fully extended. The loan replaces the previous $450,000,000 loan that bore interest at a fixed rate of 3.95% and was scheduled to mature in December 2020. 

On October 23, 2020, Alexander's completed a $94,000,000 financing of The Alexander, a 312-unit residential building that is part of Alexander's residential and retail complex located in Rego Park, Queens, New York. The interest-only loan has a fixed rate of 2.63% and matures in November 2027.

On November 2, 2020, we repaid the $52,476,000 mortgage loan on our land under a portion of the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex. The 10-year fixed rate amortizing loan bore interest at 5.14% and was scheduled to mature in February 2021. 

On November 24, 2020, Vornado sold 12,000,000 5.25% Series N cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share, pursuant to an effective registration statement. Vornado received aggregate net proceeds of $291,182,000, after underwriters' discount and issuance costs and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 12,000,000 5.25% Series N preferred units (with economic terms that mirror those of the Series N preferred shares). Dividends on the Series N preferred shares/units are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears. The Series N preferred shares/units are not convertible into, or exchangeable for, any of our properties or securities. On or after five years from the date of issuance (or sooner under limited circumstances), Vornado may redeem the Series N preferred shares/units at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption. The Series N preferred shares/units have no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by Vornado.

Risk Factors" in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

OPERATING RESULTS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, we also disclose FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance. Reconciliations of net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions are provided on the following page. Reconciliations of FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted are provided on page 3 of this press release.

Below is a reconciliation of net (loss) income to NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the three months ended September 30, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NOI at share represents total revenues less operating expenses including our share of partially owned entities. NOI at share - cash basis represents NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments. We consider NOI at share - cash basis to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI at share - cash basis, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. NOI at share - cash basis includes rent that has been deferred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rent deferrals generally require repayment in monthly installments over a period of time not to exceed twelve months.
