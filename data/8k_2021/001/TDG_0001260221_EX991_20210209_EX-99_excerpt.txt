TransDigm Group Reports Fiscal 2021 First Quarter Results

Cleveland, Ohio, February 9, 2021/PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE: TDG), a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components, today reported results for the first quarter ended January 2, 2021, which were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

First quarter highlights include:

•Net sales of $1,108 million, down 24.4% from $1,465 million in the prior year's quarter;

•Income from continuing operations of $50 million;

•Loss per share from continuing operations of $(0.42), with the loss driven by $1.32 per share of dividend equivalent payments made during the quarter, pursuant with the Company's employee stock option program;

•EBITDA As Defined margin of 42.8%, representing sequential improvement;

•EBITDA As Defined of $474 million;

•Adjusted earnings per share of $1.97; and

•Strong operating cash flow generation of $274 million.

Fiscal 2021 financial guidance will not be issued at this time.

Net sales for the quarter declined 24.4%, or $357 million, to $1,108 million from $1,465 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. In the current quarter, all sales represent organic sales.

Income from continuing operations for the quarter was $50 million, a decrease of 78.6% compared to $234 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. The decrease in income from continuing operations primarily reflects the decline in net sales described above and higher interest expense, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.

GAAP earnings per share were reduced in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 by $1.32 per share and $3.22 per share, respectively, as a result of dividend equivalent payments made during each quarter. As a reminder, GAAP earnings per share are reduced when TransDigm makes dividend equivalent payments pursuant to the Company's stock option plans. These dividend equivalent payments are made during the Company's first fiscal quarter each year and also upon payment of any special dividends.

Adjusted net income for the quarter decreased 59.4% to $115 million, or $1.97 per share, from $283 million, or $4.93 per share, in the comparable quarter a year ago.

EBITDA for the quarter decreased 38.0% to $378 million from $610 million for the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined for the period decreased 30.4% to $474 million compared with $681 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 42.8%.

“Although commercial air travel demand has shown slight signs of recovery in recent months, the recovery is expected to continue to be slow and uneven depending on factors such as COVID-19 infection rates, vaccine rollout and effectiveness, and the easing of quarantines and travel restrictions, among other factors. Despite the challenges the commercial aerospace industry continues to face, I am pleased that we were able to sequentially expand our EBITDA As Defined margin to 42.8% as a result of careful management of our cost structure and focus on our operating strategy," stated Kevin Stein, TransDigm Group's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Additionally, we are excited to have recently closed the acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity. Cobham Aero Connectivity has established positions across a diverse range of new and existing aircraft platforms and the business fits well with our long-standing strategy."

The effective tax rate in the current quarter of 5.5% was favorably impacted by the timing of tax benefits associated with the Company’s equity compensation plans. For the full 2021 fiscal year, consistent with previously disclosed expectations, the Company expects its GAAP, Cash and Adjusted tax rates to be in the range of 18-22%.

Acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity

Subsequent to the quarter, on January 5, 2021, TransDigm completed substantially all of the acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity ("CAC") for approximately $965 million, including tax benefits to be realized by TransDigm. CAC is a leading provider of highly engineered antennas and radios for the aerospace end market. The products are primarily proprietary with significant aftermarket content and have a strong presence across major defense platforms as well as select commercial applications. Nearly 60% of CAC's revenue is derived from international sales and over 70% of CAC's revenue comes from the aftermarket. CAC has a strong presence across a diverse range of both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. 

A portion of the CAC acquisition representing approximately 2% of the total purchase price remains subject to Finnish regulatory approval and is expected to close during the second quarter of fiscal 2021.

Financing Activity Subsequent to the Quarter

On January 20, 2021, TransDigm successfully completed a private offering of $1.2 billion of 4.625% senior subordinated notes due 2029. TransDigm expects to use the net proceeds from the offering, plus cash on hand, to redeem all of its $1.2 billion of outstanding 6.50% senior subordinated notes due 2024. 

Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, and adjusted net income; a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, and a reconciliation of (loss) earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share for the periods discussed in this press release.

Fiscal 2021 Outlook

Given the considerable uncertainty around the extent and duration of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and how that will impact operations, the Company will not provide fiscal year 2021 guidance at this time.

Non-GAAP Supplemental Information

EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release as supplemental disclosures to net income and reported results. TransDigm Group defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and defines EBITDA As Defined as EBITDA plus certain non-operating items recorded as corporate expenses, including non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with TransDigm Group's stock incentive plans, restructuring costs related to TransDigm Group's cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs. TransDigm Group defines adjusted net income as net income plus purchase accounting backlog amortization expense, effects from the sale on businesses, non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with TransDigm Group's stock incentive plans, restructuring costs related to TransDigm Group's cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs. EBITDA As Defined Margin represents EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales. TransDigm Group defines adjusted diluted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the total shares for basic and diluted earnings per share. For more information regarding the computation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined and adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, please see the attached financial tables.

TransDigm Group presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that they are useful indicators of its operating performance. TransDigm Group believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes, capitalized asset values and employee compensation structures, all of which can vary substantially from company to company. In addition, analysts, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company’s ability to incur and service debt. EBITDA As Defined is used to measure TransDigm Inc.’s compliance with the financial covenant contained in its credit facility. TransDigm Group’s management also uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess its operating performance, to prepare its annual budget and financial projections and to review and evaluate its management team in connection with employee incentive programs. Moreover, TransDigm Group’s management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions and as a liquidity measure. In addition, TransDigm Group’s management uses adjusted net income as a measure of comparable operating performance between time periods and among companies as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance.

None of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income or adjusted earnings per share is a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and such financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities or other measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, TransDigm Group’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Although we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

•

neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;

•

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;

•

the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined;

•

neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; and

•

EBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.
