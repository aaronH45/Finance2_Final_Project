Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

Executive Severance Benefits Plan. On February 17, 2021, the Human Capital and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp (the “Company” or “Bancorp”), adopted the Fifth Third Bank, National Association Executive Severance Benefits Plan (the “Severance Benefits Plan”) which became effective on February 17, 2021. Benefits under the Severance Benefits Plan are available to certain executive employees of Fifth Third Bank, National Association (the “Bank”).  

Participating executives are eligible to receive certain severance benefits as described in the Severance Benefits Plan if such executive’s employment terminates prior to a change in control of the Bank or more than 24 months following a change in control, but only if the Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that the executive’s employment was terminated involuntarily by the Bank without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason” (each as defined in the Severance Benefits Plan). For purposes of the Severance Benefits Plan, a change in control has the meaning given to that term in the Fifth Third Bancorp Executive Change in Control Severance Plan, as amended (the “CIC Plan”).  

The benefits payable under the Severance Benefits Plan consist of the following:  

   •    

Severance pay in the following amounts, payable in quarterly installments over the 12-month period following termination of employment, based on the tier classification of the executive’s job position:  

   •    

Tier 1 – 2 times base annual salary  

   •    

Tier 2 – 1.5 times base annual salary  

   •    

Tier 3 – 1 times base annual salary  

Our named executive officers currently employed with the Company are eligible for the benefits commensurate with Tier 2, with the exception of Greg D. Carmichael, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Timothy N. Spence, President of the Bancorp, who are currently eligible for benefits commensurate with Tier 1.  

   •    

A lump sum payment of a portion of the executive’s annual bonus for the year in which termination of employment occurs prorated based on the number of days elapsed; and  

   •    

A lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) times the monthly COBRA premium costs for the Bank-sponsored medical, dental and vision coverage in which the executive participated.  

Benefits under the Severance Benefits Plan are conditioned upon the executive satisfying certain conditions including, without limitation, execution of an agreement to arbitrate disputes and, upon termination of employment, an agreement containing, among other things, covenants not to use confidential information, not to compete with the Bank, not to solicit its customers and employees and not to disparage the Bank, and also containing a general release of claims.   

Executive Change in Control Severance Plan. In connection with the adoption of the Severance Benefits Plan, on February 17, 2021, the Committee also approved a Second Amendment to the CIC Plan, effective February 17, 2021, to eliminate any right to benefits under the CIC Plan in any circumstance in which an executive is entitled to receive benefits under the Severance Benefits Plan, and to extend the benefits provided under the CIC Plan to certain qualifying terminations of employment that occur within six months prior to a change in control (but only if the executive is not eligible to receive payments under another severance plan, policy or agreement, such as the Severance Benefits Plan).  

The foregoing descriptions of the Severance Benefits Plan and the amendment to the CIC Plan are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copy of the Severance Benefits Plan attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and the copy of such amendment attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
