“We ended the year on a strong note with our global beverage business having accelerated while our global snacks and food business remained resilient in the fourth quarter.

“Moving forward, we remain committed to supporting our employees, customers and communities. In addition, we will continue to focus on winning in the marketplace and investing to build competitive advantages that will enable us to become an even Faster, Stronger and Better organization.”

“For 2021, we are planning for our organic revenue and core constant currency EPS growth to be consistent with our long-term objectives. We have also announced a 5 percent increase in our annualized dividend, starting with the June 2021 dividend payment.”

Summary Fourth Quarter 2020 Performance

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In certain instances, the unit volume change differs from the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth, due to product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE.

Note: Amounts may not sum due to rounding. 

Organic revenue growth and core constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP information in the attached exhibits and to the Glossary for definitions of “organic,” “core” and “constant currency.”

Discussion of Fourth Quarter 2020 Reported Division Results:

In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 3 and A-7, reported operating results were driven by the following:

Frito-Lay North America

Operating profit decreased 4%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases and a 5-percentange-point impact of higher restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by productivity savings and net revenue growth. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points.

Quaker Foods North America

Operating profit grew 17%, primarily reflecting net revenue growth, productivity savings and lower advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points.

PepsiCo Beverages North America

Operating profit grew 19%, primarily reflecting net revenue growth, productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and a 6-percentage-point impact of lower commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental information technology costs, a 3-percentage-point impact of a prior-year gain on an asset sale and a 2-percentage-point impact of the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Acquisitions contributed 10 percentage points to operating profit growth.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we received notice of termination without cause from Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which would end our distribution rights of Bang Energy drinks, effective October 24, 2023.

Latin America

Operating profit decreased 7%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases and a 15-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs largely due to transaction-related foreign exchange, partially offset by productivity savings, effective net pricing and a 4.5-percentage-point impact of certain tax credits in Brazil. Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange and the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic each negatively impacted operating profit performance by 10 percentage points.

Europe

Operating profit decreased 10%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 10-percentage- point impact of higher commodity costs due to transaction-related foreign exchange and a 4.5-percentage-point impact of certain tax charges. These impacts were partially offset by organic volume growth and productivity savings. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 5 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively.

Africa, Middle East and South Asia

Operating profit grew 80%, primarily reflecting productivity savings, a 27-percentange-point contribution from the Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods) acquisition, organic volume growth, a 20-percentage-point impact of lower restructuring and impairment charges, lower advertising and marketing expenses and a 3-percentage-point impact of lower commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, unfavorable net pricing and a 7-percentage-point impact of the settlement of a legal claim in the prior year. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced operating profit growth by 7 percentage points.

3

Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region

Operating profit grew 7%, primarily reflecting productivity savings, net revenue growth, an 8-percentage- point impact of favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals compared to the prior year and a 6-percentage-point impact of lower restructuring and impairment charges. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. An operating loss for Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery) and inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with the Be & Cheery acquisition reduced operating profit growth by 5 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively.

Discussion of Full-Year 2020 Reported Division Results:

In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 6 and A-7, reported operating results were driven by the following:

Frito-Lay North America

Quaker Foods North America

Operating profit grew 23%, reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage points.

PepsiCo Beverages North America

Operating profit decreased 11%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including incremental information technology costs, a 14-percentage-point impact of the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the organic volume decrease. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing, productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses, and a 4-percentage-point impact of lower commodity costs. Prior-year gains associated with sales of assets negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. Additionally, impairment charges associated with a coconut water brand negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. Acquisitions positively contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit performance.

Latin America

Operating profit decreased 10%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases and a 9-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs due to transaction-related foreign exchange. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and the effective net pricing. Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange and certain charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 11 percentage points and 8 percentage points, respectively.

Europe

Operating profit increased 2%, primarily reflecting the organic volume growth, productivity savings, a 4-percentage-point impact of lower restructuring and impairment charges, a 3-percentage-point impact of the prior-year inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges primarily associated with our acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) and a 2-percentage-point impact of a gain on an asset sale. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 2-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs due to transaction-related foreign exchange. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 6 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively. 

Africa, Middle East and South Asia

Operating profit decreased 11%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, partially offset by productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and a 3-percentage-point impact of lower commodity costs. The inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with our Pioneer Foods acquisition negatively impacted operating profit performance by 24 percentage points and were partially offset by Pioneer Foods’ 9-percentage-point positive contribution to operating profit performance. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 5 percentage points.

Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region

Operating profit increased 24%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 10-percentage-point impact of lower restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses.

Dividend Increase

The Company today announced a 5 percent increase in its annualized dividend to $4.30 per share from $4.09 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2021. This represents the Company’s 49th consecutive annual dividend per share increase.

Guidance and Outlook

The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and commodity mark-to-market net impacts.

For 2021, the Company expects: 

•A mid-single digit increase in organic revenue;

•A high-single digit increase in core constant currency EPS;

•A core annual effective tax rate of approximately 21 percent; and

•Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $5.9 billion, comprised of dividends of approximately $5.8 billion and share repurchases of approximately $100 million. We have recently completed our share repurchase activity and do not expect to repurchase any additional shares for the balance of 2021.

In addition, the Company expects a 1 percentage-point foreign exchange translation tailwind to benefit reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.

Non-GAAP Measures

In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): core results, core constant currency results and organic revenue growth. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. 

We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures included herein. 

Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

Glossary

We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:

Acquisitions and divestitures: All mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.

Beverage volume: Volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.

Bottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.

Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers, retailers and independent distributors. 

Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.

Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. For further information regarding these excluded items for the periods presented, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2020 Form 10-K. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:

Mark-to-market net impact

Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.

Restructuring and impairment charges

Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019. 

Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges

In the year ended December 26, 2020, charges related to our acquisitions of BFY Brands, Inc. (BFY Brands), Rockstar Energy Beverages (Rockstar), Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery.

In the year ended December 28, 2019, charges primarily related to our acquisition of SodaStream.

A - 5

Pension-related settlement charges

In the year ended December 26, 2020, we recorded a pension settlement charge related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost.

In the year ended December 28, 2019, settlement charges related to the purchase of a group annuity contract and settlement charges related to one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits.

Net tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. In periods subsequent to the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized certain tax benefits and/or expenses associated therewith.

Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.

Organic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, foreign exchange translation and, where applicable, the impact of the 53rd reporting week.

2021 guidance and long-term organic revenue and core constant currency EPS targets 

Our 2021 organic revenue growth guidance and our long-term organic revenue growth target exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2021 core effective tax rate guidance, our 2021 core constant currency EPS growth guidance and our long-term core constant currency EPS growth target exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses and restructuring and impairment charges. Our 2021 core constant currency EPS growth guidance and long-term core constant currency EPS growth target also exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2021 or our long-term organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2021 and long-term reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2021 and long-term impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2021 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2021 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2021 or long-term core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2021 and long-term reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2021 and long-term impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
