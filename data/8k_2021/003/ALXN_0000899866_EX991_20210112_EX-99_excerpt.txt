Forward-looking statements are subject to factors that may cause Alexion's results and plans to differ materially from those forward-looking statements, including for example: the risk that the proposed acquisition of Alexion by Astra Zeneca may not be completed and such failure could negatively affect our stock price and future business and financial results and if the Astra Zeneca merger agreement is terminated, we may be forced to pay a termination fee to Astra Zeneca; the severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Alexion’s business, including on commercial and clinical development programs; our dependence on sales from our C5 products (SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS); delays (expected or unexpected) in the time it takes regulatory agencies to review and make determinations on applications for the marketing approval of our products; Alexion’s inability to timely submit (or failure to submit) future applications for regulatory approval for our products and product candidates; payer, physician and patient acceptance of ULTOMIRIS as an alternative to SOLIRIS; appropriate pricing for ULTOMIRIS; future competition from biosimilars and novel products; inability to timely initiate (or failure to initiate) and complete future clinical trials due to safety issues, IRB decisions, CMC-related issues, expense or unfavorable results from earlier trials (among other reasons); the number of patients that will use our products and product candidates in the future; decisions of regulatory authorities regarding the adequacy of our research, marketing approval or material limitations on the marketing of our products; delays or failure of product candidates to obtain regulatory approval; delays or the inability to launch product candidates due to regulatory restrictions, anticipated expense or other matters; interruptions or failures in the manufacture and supply of our products and our product candidates; failure to satisfactorily address matters raised by the FDA and other regulatory agencies; results in early stage clinical trials may not be indicative of full results or results from later stage or larger clinical trials (or broader patient populations) and do not ensure regulatory approval; the possibility that results of clinical trials are not predictive of safety and efficacy and potency of our products (or we fail to adequately operate or manage our clinical trials) which could cause us to halt trials, delay or prevent us from making regulatory approval filings or result in denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates; unexpected delays in clinical trials; unexpected concerns that may arise from additional data or analysis obtained during clinical trials; future product improvements may not be realized due to expense or feasibility or other factors; uncertainty of long-term success in developing, licensing or acquiring other product candidates or additional indications for existing products; inability to complete acquisitions due to failure of regulatory approval or material changes in target or otherwise; inability to complete acquisitions and investments due to increased competition for technology; the possibility that current rates of adoption of our products are not sustained (or anticipated adoption rates are not realized); internal development efforts do not result in commercialization of additional products; the adequacy of our pharmacovigilance and drug safety reporting processes; failure to protect and enforce our data, intellectual property and proprietary rights and the risks and uncertainties relating to intellectual property claims, lawsuits and challenges against us (including intellectual property lawsuits relating to products brought by third parties against Alexion); the risk that third party payors (including governmental agencies) will not reimburse or continue to reimburse for the use of our products at acceptable rates or at all; failure to realize the benefits and potential of investments, collaborations, licenses and acquisitions; failure by regulatory authorities to approve transactions; the possibility that expected tax benefits will not be realized or that tax liabilities exceed current expectations; assessment of impact of recent accounting pronouncements; potential declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in countries where we sell our products; delay of collection or reduction in reimbursement due to adverse economic conditions or changes in government and private insurer regulations and approaches to reimbursement; uncertainties surrounding legal proceedings, company investigations and government investigations; the risk that estimates regarding the number of patients with PNH, aHUS, gMG, NMOSD, HPP and LAL-D and other future indications we are pursuing are inaccurate; the risks of changing foreign exchange rates; risks relating to the potential effects of the Company's restructuring; risks related to the acquisition of companies and co-development and collaboration efforts; and a variety of other risks set forth from time to time in Alexion's filings with the SEC, including but not limited to the risks discussed in Alexion's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2020 and in our other filings with the SEC. Alexion disclaims any obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, except when a duty arises under law.In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures that Alexion believes, when considered together with the GAAP information, provide investors and management with supplemental information relating to performance, trends and prospects that promote a more complete understanding of our operating results and financial position during different periods.

 APPENDIX Alexion Current Indications Indication Description Links PNH Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria Chronic, debilitating, and potentially life-threatening ultra-rare blood disorder, with an average age of onset in the early 30s more info aHUS atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Ultra-rare, genetic, chronic, potentially life-threatening disease. Chronic uncontrolled complement activation results in thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) more info gMG Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Debilitating, chronic, and progressive autoimmune neuromuscular disease. more info NMOSD Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Rare, devastating, complement-mediated disorder of the central nervous system characterized by relapses where each individual attack results in cumulative disability including blindness and paralysis, and sometimes premature death (primarily affects women) more info HPP Hypophosphatemia Inherited, progressive, ultra-rare metabolic disease in which patients experience devastating effects on multiple systems of the body, and face debilitating or life-threatening complications more info LAL-D Liposomal Acid Lipase Deficiency Genetic, chronic, and progressive ultra-rare metabolic disease in which infants, children, and adults experience continuous, uncontrolled accumulation of cholesteryl esters (CEs) and triglycerides (TGs) that may lead to multi-organ damage and premature death more info ANDEXXA Coagulation factor Xa reversal (recombinant) Reversal agent for life-threatening bleeds induced by factor Xa inhibitors more info    

 APPENDIX Alexion Pipeline Indications - I Indication Description Links WD Wilson Disease Rare, chronic, genetic, and potentially life-threatening liver disorder of impaired copper transport. The disorder is characterized by build-up of intra-cellular hepatic copper. Untreated, Wilson disease leads to various combinations and severity of hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms, and can be fatal. ALA AL (Light-chain) Amyloidosis A protein misfolding disorder in which B-cells produce incomplete  and  light chain antibodies which clump in certain organs / tissues (including heart, lungs, kidneys, nervous system, and liver, eventually causing organ damage and death. more info PNH-EVH Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria with Extravascular Hemolysis Chronic, debilitating, and potentially life-threatening ultra-rare blood disorder, with an average age of onset in the early 30s. EVH occurs when C3 opsonization of red blood cells causes macrophages to destroy those cells in tissue. DM Dermatomyositis Progressive autoimmune condition that causes skin changes and muscle weakness. Symptoms can include a red skin rash around the eyelids, red bumps around the joints, and muscle weakness in the arms and legs. Dermatomyositis is most common in adults between ages 40 and 60, or in children between ages 5 and 15. more info HSCT-TMA Hematopoetic Stem Cell Transplant Thrombotic Micro-Angiopathy A significant and often lethal complication of HSCT. The condition is a systemic, multifactorial disorder caused by endothelial cell damage induced by conditioning regimens, immunosuppressant therapies, infection, graft versus host disease (GVHD), and other factors associated with HSCT. HSCT-TMA prognosis is poor, with overall mortality reported as high as ~80-90%.    

 APPENDIX Alexion Pipeline Indications - II Indication Description Links CM-TMA Complement-Mediated Thrombotic Micro-Angiopathy Caused by abnormalities of regulation of the alternative pathway of complement activation. The indication describes a group of severe and chronic ultra-rare diseases that can cause progressive injury to vital organs— via damage to the walls of blood vessels and blood clots—potentially leading to organ failure and premature death. CM-TMA affects both adults and children and represents the population of patients with aHUS with or without triggers. COVID-19 Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in COVID-19 patients Patients with severe illness include those who are hospitalized with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Evidence suggests that acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 may be mediated in part by complement pathway whereby elevated C5 ultimately leads to severe pneumonia, blood clots and multi-organ dysfunction in many advanced COVID patients. WAIHA Warm Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia Rare autoimmune disorder caused by pathogenic Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that react with and cause the premature destruction of red blood cells at normal body temperature. The disease is often characterized by profound, and potentially life-threatening anemia and other acute complications. ATTR-CM Transthyretin Amyloidosis (ATTR) with Cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) A progressive, fatal disease caused by the accumulation of misfolded tetrameric transthyretin (TTR) amyloid in the heart. Caused by the destabilization of TTR due to inherited mutations or aging, symptoms usually manifest later in life (age 50+), with median survival of three to five years from diagnosis.    

 APPENDIX Alexion Pipeline Indications - III Indication Description Links LN Lupus Nephritis An inflammatory renal disease that is a severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in which deposits of immune complexes (e.g., IgG and complement) accumulate in the kidney and lead to injury. Approximately 30% SLE patients develop LN, and up to 30% of patients are refractory to treatment and progress to end stage renal disease requiring dialysis/transplant within 15 years . There are no FDA approved therapies for LN. PMN Primary Membranous Nephropathy Rare autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibodies to the podocyte membrane antigens PLA2R (~85%) and THSD7A (~5%) that causes nephrotic syndrome and chronic kidney disease. Approximately 30% of patients will progress to end stage renal disease within 10 years of diagnosis. IgAN IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) A heterogenous disease in terms of clinical manifestations and progression and is the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritis. In IgAN, locally deposited immune complexes lead to activation of the complement cascade & downstream endothelial organ damage. The Lectin and Alternative Pathways are believed to be the main driver of disease progression, which includes end stage renal disease and need for dialysis or transplant. C3G Complement 3 Glomerulopathy Ultra-rare, heterogenous renal disease characterized by uncontrolled continued activation of fluid and/or solid phase alternative pathway causing C3 deposition and inflammation, leading to kidney damage . ALS Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis A rare neurological disorder of progressive deterioration of nerve cells (motor neurons) in the brain and the spinal cord that control muscles throughout the body. Loss of motor neurons and muscle strength leads to loss of independence, paralysis and death, typically due to respiratory insufficiency.
