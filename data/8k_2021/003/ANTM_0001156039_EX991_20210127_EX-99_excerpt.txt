Please refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables on page 17.  

Membership: Medical enrollment totaled approximately 42.9 million members at December 31, 2020, an increase of 1.9 million lives, or 4.7 percent from December 31, 2019. Total risk enrollment grew by 1.7 million lives, or 11 percent, and fee-based enrollment grew by 211 thousand lives, or 0.8 percent. Government Business enrollment increased by 1.9 million lives compared to the prior year, attributable to Medicaid, reflecting organic growth as a result of the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification efforts in our markets as well as our acquisition of the Medicaid plans in Missouri and Nebraska, and growth in Medicare Advantage. Commercial & Specialty Business enrollment increased by 67 thousand lives driven by the acquisition of AmeriBen and growth in our National business, partially offset by higher in-group change as a result of the economic environment.  

During the fourth quarter of 2020, medical enrollment increased sequentially by 300 thousand lives, reflecting organic growth in Medicaid and Medicare businesses as well as sales exceeding lapses in our Local Group business, partially offset by in-group change in the National business.  

Operating Revenue: Operating revenue was $31.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $4.4 billion, or 16.2 percent, versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher premium revenue due to growth in Medicaid and Medicare. The increase was further attributable to pharmacy product revenue related to IngenioRx and the return of the health insurance tax in 2020.   

Benefit Expense Ratio: The benefit expense ratio was 88.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of 10 basis point from 89.0 percent compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by reduced non-COVID healthcare utilization due to the pandemic, and to a lesser extent, the return of the health insurance tax in 2020. Taken together, the decrease was largely offset by costs associated with COVID-19, including testing and treatment and the actions taken to support our members in response to the pandemic.  

Medical claims reserves established at December 31, 2019 developed in line with the Company’s expectations during 2020.  

Days in Claims Payable: Days in Claims Payable was 43.4 days as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 2.3 days from September 30, 2020 and an increase of 5.4 days as compared to December 31, 2019.  

SG&A Expense Ratio: The SG&A expense ratio was 13.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 80 basis points from 12.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by the return of the health insurance tax in 2020 and increased spend to support growth, partially offset by growth in operating revenue.   

Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $2.5 billion compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the timing of working capital changes, including the early receipt of certain payments that were originally expected to be received in 2021, and growth in premium revenue due to the return of the health insurance tax in 2020 as well as membership growth in our Government business.  

4   

Share Repurchase Program: During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased 4.4 million shares of its common stock for $1.4 billion, or a weighted average price of $305.66. For the full year, the Company repurchased 9.4 million shares for $2.7 billion, or a weighted average price of $286.35. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $1.1 billion remaining of Board-approved share repurchase authorization. On January 26, 2021, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company intends to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions.  

Cash Dividend: During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.95 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $234 million.  

On January 26, 2021, the Audit Committee declared a first quarter 2021 dividend to shareholders of $1.13 per share. On an annualized basis, this equates to a dividend of $4.52 per share. The first quarter dividend is payable on March 25, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021.  

Investment Portfolio & Capital Position: During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded net realized gains of $5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded net realized gains of $7 million.  

As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s net unrealized gain position in the investment portfolio was $1.2 billion, consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities. As of December 31, 2020 cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $1.7 billion.

Commercial & Specialty Business: Operating gain in the Commercial & Specialty Business segment totaled $123 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $404 million from an operating gain of $527 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to costs associated with COVID-19, including testing and treatment and the actions taken to support our members in response to the pandemic, partially offset by reduced non-COVID healthcare utilization. Additionally, the decline was driven by the shift of pharmacy earnings to the IngenioRx segment.  

Government Business: Operating gain in the Government Business segment was $169 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $417 million, or 71.2 percent, from $586 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by costs associated with COVID-19, including testing and treatment and the actions taken to support our members in response to the pandemic, partially offset by reduced non-COVID healthcare utilization. The decline was further attributable to the shift of pharmacy earnings to the IngenioRx segment, retroactive rate adjustments in Medicaid, and increased spend to support growth.  

6   

IngenioRx: IngenioRx commenced operations in the second quarter of 2019 and the transition of membership was completed on January 1, 2020. Operating gain was $363 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Calendar year 2020 represented the first full year of operations for IngenioRx.

Basis of Presentation  

 1.  

Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to page 17 for the GAAP reconciliation tables.  

 2.  

Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.
