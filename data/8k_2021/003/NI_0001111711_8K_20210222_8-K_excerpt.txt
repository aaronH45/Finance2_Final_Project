 Item 1.01.  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On February 22, 2021, NiSource Inc. (the “Company”) entered into six separate equity distribution agreements, each dated February 22, 2021 (the “Equity Distribution Agreements”), (i) among the Company, Barclays Capital Inc., as sales agent and forward seller, and Barclays Bank PLC, as forward purchaser, (ii) among the Company, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as sales agent and forward seller, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as forward purchaser, (iii) between the Company and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., in its capacities as sales agent, forward seller and forward purchaser, (iv) among the Company, Mizuho Securities USA LLC, as sales agent and forward seller, and Mizuho Markets Americas LLC, as forward purchaser, (v) between the Company and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, in its capacities as sales agent, forward seller and forward purchaser, and (vi) among the Company, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agent (collectively with the other sales agents, the “Agents”) and forward seller, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as forward purchaser, relating to issuances, offers and sales of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share. In accordance with the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreements, the Company may offer and sell up to an aggregate of $750,000,000 of its common stock (including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to the forward sale agreements described below, the “Shares”) from time to time through any of the Agents, acting in their capacity as sales agents or as forward sellers, as described below. The sales of Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreements will be made in transactions that are deemed to be “at-the-market” offerings, including sales made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or as agreed to with the applicable Agent and any related forward seller and forward purchaser.  

The Equity Distribution Agreements provide that, in addition to the issuance and sale of the shares by the Company through the Agents in their capacity as Agents, the Company may enter into forward sale agreements with the Agents or certain of their respective affiliates (when acting in its capacity under such a forward sale agreement, a “Forward Purchaser”). Concurrently with, and pursuant to, the Equity Distribution Agreements, the Company entered into six separate master forward sale confirmations (the “Master Forward Sale Confirmations”), each dated February 22, 2021, with Barclays Bank PLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Mizuho Markets Americas LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, respectively, as forward purchasers. In connection with each forward sale agreement under a Master Forward Sale Confirmation, the relevant Forward Purchaser will, at the Company’s request, borrow from third parties and, through the relevant Agent, sell a number of Shares equal to the number of Shares underlying the particular forward sale agreement to hedge the forward sale agreement (each Agent, when acting as agent for a Forward Purchaser, a “Forward Seller”).  

The Company will not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of borrowed shares of the Company’s common stock by a Forward Seller. The Company expects to receive proceeds from the sale of Shares by a Forward Seller upon future physical settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement with the relevant Forward Purchaser on dates specified by the Company on or prior to the maturity date of the relevant forward sale agreement. If the Company elects to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement, the Company may not (in the case of cash settlement) or will not (in the case of net share settlement) receive any proceeds, and the Company may owe cash (in the case of cash settlement) or shares of common stock (in the case of net share settlement) to the relevant Forward Purchaser.  

The Agents will offer the Shares at market prices prevailing at the time of sale. The Company will pay each Agent a commission of up to 2% of the sales price of all Shares issued by the Company and sold through the relevant Agent under the applicable Equity Distribution Agreement. The remaining sales proceeds, after deducting any expenses payable by the Company and any transaction fees imposed by any governmental, regulatory or self-regulatory organization in connection with the sales, will be the Company’s net proceeds for the sale of the Shares. In connection with each forward sale agreement, the relevant Forward Seller will receive, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price payable by the relevant Forward Purchaser under its forward sale agreement, a commission of up to 2% of the volume weighted average of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of Common Stock sold during the applicable period by it as a Forward Seller.  

The Shares will be issued pursuant to the Company’s automatic shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 1, 2019 (File No. 333-234422), a base prospectus, dated November 1, 2019, included as part of the registration statement, and a prospectus supplement, dated February 22, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.   

The foregoing description of the Equity Distribution Agreements and the Master Forward Sale Confirmations does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of the forms of Equity Distribution Agreement and Master Forward Sale Confirmation, which are filed as Exhibits 1.1 and 1.2, respectively, and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
