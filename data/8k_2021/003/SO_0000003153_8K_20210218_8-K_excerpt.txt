Item 2.02Results of Operations and Financial Condition

The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

On February 18, 2021, The Southern Company (“Southern Company”) issued a press release regarding its earnings for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.07 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Exhibits 99.01, 99.02, 99.03 and 99.04 to this Current Report on Form 8-K include earnings and earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. These exhibits also include earnings and earnings per share (1) for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, excluding (a) charges (net of salvage proceeds), associated legal expenses (net of insurance recoveries), and tax impacts related to plants under construction, (b) acquisition and disposition impacts, (c) impairment charges and (d) earnings from the Wholesale Gas Services business and (2) for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 excluding costs related to the extinguishment of debt at Southern Company. The attached exhibits include additional information regarding these excluded items, as well as reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable financial measure under GAAP. Southern Company believes the presentation of 

earnings and earnings per share, excluding these items, is useful to investors because it provides investors with additional information to evaluate the performance of Southern Company’s ongoing business activities. Southern Company management also uses earnings and earnings per share, excluding the effect of these items, to evaluate the performance of Southern Company’s ongoing business activities. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
