Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

On February 17, 2021, Centene Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), completed its previously announced underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of $2,200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2.50% Senior Notes due 2031 (the “Notes”). The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on hand, to (1) fund the purchase price for the Company’s 4.75% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) accepted for purchase by the Company in its concurrent cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) for any and all $2,200,000,000 outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, (2) redeem any remaining 2025 Notes not validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer, in accordance with the indentures governing the 2025 Notes, and (3) pay all premiums, accrued interest and expenses related to the foregoing. Pending the application of any of the net proceeds of the Offering for the foregoing purposes, net proceeds may be temporarily used by the Company for general corporate purposes. 

The Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 PM New York City time on February 17, 2021, unless extended by the Company. The redemption of the 2025 Notes is scheduled to occur on March 12, 2021, pursuant to previously delivered redemption notices, which each became unconditional upon closing of the Offering. 

The Notes are governed by the terms of the Indenture, dated as of October 7, 2020 (the “Base Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 17, 2021 (the “Second Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”), between the Company and the Trustee. 

The Notes will mature on March 1, 2031 and the Company will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, beginning on September 1, 2021. The Notes will be the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Notes will be effectively junior to all existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes will not be guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries. 

The Company may redeem the Notes at any time or from time to time in whole or in part, prior to December 1, 2030 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes) (the “Par Call Date”), at its option at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on that redemption date, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to, but excluding, the date of redemption) that would be due if such Notes matured on the Par Call Date, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture) plus 50 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Company may also redeem the Notes at any time or from time to time in whole or in part, on and after the Par Call Date, at its option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being redeemed, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. 

Subject to certain limitations, if the Company experiences specific kinds of changes of control, it will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. 

The Indenture provides for customary events of default, including failure to make required payments; failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants; failure to pay, or acceleration of, certain other material indebtedness; certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency; and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the amounts due under the Notes. 

The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Registration No. 333-238050) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and became effective on May 6, 2020. The Company has filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement, dated February 10, 2021, together with the accompanying prospectus, dated May 6, 2020, relating to the offering and sale of the Notes. 

The foregoing description of the Base Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Base Indenture, which is incorporated herein by reference, and each of the Second Supplemental Indenture and the form of Note due 2031, each of which are attached to this Current Report and are incorporated herein by reference on Form 8-K as Exhibits 4.2 and 4.3, respectively.
