EXPLANATORY NOTE

This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 22, 2020 (the “Initial Form 8-K”) by General Electric Company (“GE” or the “Company”), concerning the decision of the Audit Committee of GE’s Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”) to select Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the Company’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, following the completion of the audit services provided by KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 and the filing of the Company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K on February 12, 2021.

Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant

As previously reported in the Initial Form 8-K, on June 18, 2020, the Audit Committee selected Deloitte as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the Company’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. KPMG continued as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. On February 12, 2021, when the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 with the SEC, KPMG completed its audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for such fiscal year, and the Company’s retention of KPMG as its independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements ended as of that date.

KPMG’s reports on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the subsequent interim period through February 12, 2021, the effective date of KPMG’s dismissal, there were: (i) no disagreements within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions between the Company and KPMG on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to KPMG’s satisfaction, would have caused KPMG to make reference thereto in their reports; and (ii) no “reportable events” within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

The Company has requested that KPMG furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of KPMG’s letter, dated February 12, 2021, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the subsequent interim period through February 12, 2021, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with Deloitte regarding: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that Deloitte concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue; (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions; or (iii) any reportable event within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
