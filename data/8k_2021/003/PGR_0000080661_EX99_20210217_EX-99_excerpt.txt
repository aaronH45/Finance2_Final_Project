Monthly Commentary

•In January, we experienced unfavorable prior accident year reserve development of 4.2 points. The unfavorable development was primarily the result of more December claims being reported in January than were anticipated in our year-end reserves. For January, incurred but not reported on December 2020 accidents are reflected in prior year development. For the remainder of the year, this situation (e.g., unfavorable development on January claims being reported in February) would be reported as current year development.

•Excluding the impact of catastrophe losses in both January 2021 and 2020, our companywide loss/LAE ratio was 5.0 points lower than January last year, in part reflecting continued lower auto accident frequency on a year-over-year basis. 

Events

Our fourth quarter Investor Relations conference call is currently scheduled to be held on Tuesday, March 2, 2021, at 1:00 p.m. eastern time. Consistent with the prior 2020 Investor Relations calls, the fourth quarter call is scheduled to last 60 minutes and will consist of a question and answer session with Tricia Griffith, our CEO, and John Sauerland, our CFO. We plan to post our 2020 Shareholders' Report online and file our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on Monday, March 1, 2021. If the dates of our events, which are always subject to change, are rescheduled, we will announce the change in a press release as soon as practical and publish it on our investor website. Details regarding access to the teleconference, or any event changes, will be available at: https://investors.progressive.com/events/default.aspx.

We plan to release February results on Wednesday, March 17, 2021, before the market opens.

In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when we establish reserves for one or more contingencies. Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results, therefore, may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
