DENVER, February 22, 2021 - Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE: XEC) today reported net income for fourth quarter 2020 of $24.7 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to a net loss of $384.1 million, or $3.87 per share, in the same period a year ago. For the full year, Cimarex reported a net loss of $1,967.5 million, or $19.73 per share, compared to 2019 net loss of $124.6 million, or $1.33 per share. Both fourth quarter and full year results were negatively impacted by a non-cash charge related to the impairment of oil and gas properties. Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $91.3 million, or $0.89 per share, compared to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $120.4 million, or $1.18 per share in the same period a year ago1. Full year 2020 adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $142.2 million, or $1.39 per share, compared to $448.8 million, or $4.46 per share  in 20191. Adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) was $256.6 million in fourth quarter 2020 compared to $416.0 million in the same period a year ago1. Full year 2020 adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) was $944.2 million compared to $1.46 billion in 20191. 

Oil volumes in the fourth quarter were sequentially lower, averaging 67.8 thousand barrels (MBbls) per day. For the full year, Cimarex reported average daily oil volumes of 76.7 MBbls, an 11 percent year-over-year decrease. Cimarex produced 229.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE) per day in the fourth quarter and averaged 252.5 MBOE per day for the year.

In the fourth quarter realized oil prices averaged $40.09 per barrel, down 27 percent from the $54.80 per barrel received in the fourth quarter of 2019. Realized natural gas prices averaged $1.69 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 42 percent from the fourth quarter 2019 average of $1.19 per Mcf. NGL prices averaged $14.02 per barrel, down one percent from the $14.13 per barrel received in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, Cimarex realized $35.59 per barrel of oil, down 33 percent from 2019, $1.05 per Mcf of natural gas and $10.53 per barrel of NGLs sold. 

Realized oil and natural gas price differentials to WTI Cushing and Henry Hub improved year-over-year. Our realized Permian oil differential to WTI Cushing averaged $(3.74) per barrel in 2020 compared to $(4.48) in 

1

2019. For the year, Cimarex's average differential on its Permian natural gas production was $(1.39) per Mcf compared to the Henry Hub index versus $(2.14) per Mcf in 2019. Cimarex's 2020 realized gas price differential in the Mid-Continent region was $(0.41) per Mcf compared to Henry Hub versus $(0.68) in 2019. 

Cimarex invested a total of $577.2 million in 2020, which includes exploration and development capital (E&D) of $544.9 million, $20.8 million to saltwater disposal and $11.5 million to midstream and other investments. E&D capital is comprised of $417.4 million attributable to drilling and completion (D&C) activities and $127.5 million for capitalized interest and overhead, production capital and leasehold acquisition. Capital investments were funded with cash flow from operations. 

Proved reserves at December 31, 2020 totaled 531 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE), down 14 percent year over year. The decrease in proved reserves resulted from a reduction in drilling activity and negative price related revisions, both due to lower commodity prices. Cimarex added 57 MMBOE through extensions and discoveries while revisions reduced proved reserves by 52 MMBOE. Production for 2020 totaled 92 MMBOE. Proved reserves are 84 percent proved developed.

Total debt at December 31, 2020 consisted of $2.0 billion of long-term notes. Cimarex had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility and a cash balance of $273.1 million at year-end. 

Cimarex repurchased and canceled 34,335 shares (55 percent) of the outstanding 8.125% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock in the fourth quarter, for a total consideration of $43.5 million including accrued and unpaid dividends.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME

The following reconciles net income (loss) as reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The tax impact in the 2020 periods is calculated using an effective tax rate that excludes the effects of the first quarter 2020 goodwill impairment, other non-deductible items, and changes in valuation allowances.

Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the noted items because management believes these items affect the comparability of operating results. The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP measures because:

a)Management uses adjusted net income to evaluate the company's operating performance between periods and to compare the company's performance to other oil and gas exploration and production companies.

b)Adjusted net income is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by research analysts.

* Does not include adjustments resulting from application of the "two-class method" used to determine earnings per share under GAAP.

** Reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period as adjusted for the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, FREE CASH FLOW AND 

FREE CASH FLOW AFTER DIVIDEND

The following table provides a reconciliation from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures of net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted cash flows from operations (non-GAAP) , free cash flow (non-GAAP) and free cash flow after dividend (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted cash flow from operations, free cash flow and free cash flow after dividend as a means of measuring our ability to fund our capital program and dividends, without fluctuations caused by changes in current assets and liabilities, which are included in the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors for the same reason, and that they are also used by professional research analysts in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.

PROVED RESERVES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Pre-tax PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is comparable to the standardized measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure but without deducting future income taxes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Cimarex's discounted future income taxes were $35.6 million and $319.4 million, respectively. Cimarex's standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $2,252.5 million at year-end 2020 and $3,629.0 million at year-end 2019. Management uses pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of the company's proved reserves and to compare relative values of proved reserves to other exploration and production companies without regard to income taxes. Management believes pre-tax PV-10 is a useful measure for comparison of proved reserve values among companies because, unlike standardized measure, it excludes future income taxes that often depend on the unique income tax characteristics of the owner of the reserves rather than on the nature, location and quality of the reserves themselves. Management further believes that professional research analysts and rating agencies use pre-tax PV-10 in similar ways. However, pre-tax PV-10 is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Cimarex's pre-tax PV-10 and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of its oil and natural gas reserves.
