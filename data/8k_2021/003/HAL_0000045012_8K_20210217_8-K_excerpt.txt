INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN REPORT 

Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

Election of Directors 

Bhavesh V. Patel was elected as a member of our Board of Directors effective February 17, 2021. Mr. Patel is the Chief Executive Officer and a director of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. He also serves on the Board of Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Houston Branch, the Greater Houston Partnership, and, until his term expires in May of 2021, as a director of Union Pacific Corporation. 

There is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Patel and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Patel was elected as a Director. The Board will appoint Mr. Patel to Committees of the Board in May. There are no related party transactions between us and Mr. Patel. 

Mr. Patel will participate in the compensation arrangements for non-management Directors as described in our Proxy Statement filed April 7, 2020. Mr. Patel will receive an initial equity award of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) equal to a pro-rated amount of the annual equity award granted to our Directors of $185,000. Each RSU represents the right to receive a share of our common stock on a future date as provided in the award agreement. The factor used to determine the prorated award is the number of whole months of service from the beginning of the month in which a Director is first elected to the following first of December divided by twelve. The number of RSUs awarded is then determined by dividing the prorated award amount by the average of the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on each business day during the month immediately preceding the Director’s election to the Board. Based on this formula, Mr. Patel will receive an initial award of 7,778 RSUs. 

We entered into indemnification agreements with Mr. Patel on February 17, 2021. The indemnification agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth therein, we will indemnify and advance certain expenses to the Director to the fullest extent, and only to the extent, permitted by applicable law in effect as of the date of the agreement and to such greater extent as applicable law may thereafter from time to time permit. The foregoing description of the indemnification agreement is only a summary and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the Form of Indemnification Agreement for Directors (first elected after January 1, 2013), which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to this Form

 8-K.
