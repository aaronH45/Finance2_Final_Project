Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On February 2, 2021, Albemarle Corporation (“Albemarle”) issued a press release announcing preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item 2.02 of Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure

On February 2, 2021, Albemarle issued a press release announcing the commencement of an underwritten public offering of $1,300,000,000 of shares of its common stock. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated by reference herein.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to fund growth capital expenditures, such as the construction and expansion of lithium operations in Australia, Chile and Silver Peak, Nevada, and opportunities in China. These and other long-term opportunities could potentially double our estimated year end 2021 lithium nameplate conversion capacity of approximately 175 kilotons lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. We expect these projects will have attractive economics, including lower capital costs per kilogram of lithium conversion capacity than our recently completed projects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any or all of these opportunities within the expected period or increase our lithium nameplate conversion capacity. We also intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for debt repayment in the short-term and other general corporate purposes.

The information in this Item 7.01 is furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K and is not deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information contained herein is not incorporated by reference in any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any filings.

Item 8.01. Other Events

In advance of the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, Albemarle is providing certain disclosures with regard to its significant mineral properties in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) Industry Guide 7 attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3 and incorporated by reference herein.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
