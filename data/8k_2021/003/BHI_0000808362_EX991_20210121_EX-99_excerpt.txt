Baker Hughes Company Announces Fourth Quarter and Total Year 2020 Results

LONDON & HOUSTON (January 21, 2021) – Baker Hughes Company (NYSE: BKR) ("Baker Hughes" or the "Company") announced results today for the fourth quarter and total year 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

"F" is used in most instances when variance is above 100%. Additionally, "U" is used in most instances when variance is below (100)%.

“We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results while navigating the impacts of the global pandemic and industry downturn. Despite an incredibly challenging year for the industry in 2020, we generated over $500 million in free cash flow, booked $6.4 billion in TPS orders, and executed on our substantial cost-out and restructuring program. We also took several important steps to accelerate our strategy and invest in energy transition technologies, helping to position the company for the future. I cannot thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication to achieve our goals and move the company forward,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, Baker Hughes chairman and chief executive officer.

“As we look ahead to 2021, we are cautiously optimistic that the global economy and oil demand will begin to recover from the impact of the global pandemic. We believe this macro environment likely translates into a tepid investment environment for oil and gas during the first half of 2021. However, we expect spending and activity levels to gain momentum through the year as the macro environment improves, likely setting up the industry for stronger growth in 2022. 

“Baker Hughes is well placed to navigate the current market environment and positioned to lead the energy transition. We remain focused on executing for customers, being disciplined on cost, and delivering for our shareholders,” concluded Simonelli.

Quarter Highlights

Supporting our Customers

The OFS segment was awarded several large contracts for drilling and completions in the fourth quarter. Equinor awarded Baker Hughes a significant portion of the drilling and well completions contracts for Phase 1 of the Bacalhau field in offshore Brazil. OFS will provide an integrated well services package for Equinor across multiple product lines, including drilling services, drill bits, drilling and completion fluids, cementing, stimulation, fishing services, and completion equipment.

OFS also secured artificial lift contracts in multiple regions, continuing to demonstrate OFS’ differentiated portfolio in electrical submersible pumping systems (ESPs) and digital monitoring solutions. Commercial agreements for artificial lift equipment and services included a seven-year contract with a customer in the Middle East, a six-year contract with a customer in Italy, and a four-year contract with a customer in the Russia Caspian region.

The OFE segment secured a major equipment order with Eni for the Agogo offshore oilfield in Angola. Consistent with Baker Hughes' Subsea Connect strategy, the order includes multiple subsea trees, wellheads, manifolds, flexible jumpers, distribution units, and controls systems for subsea and the topside. 

The TPS segment was awarded a major contract by South Gas Company (SGC) in Iraq for the design, manufacturing, delivery, construction and commissioning of an integrated facility for the processing and production of natural gas. The facility is expected to have a capacity of 200 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day and utilize previously flared natural gas from the Nassiriya and Gharraf oil fields, reducing emissions by an estimated 6+ million tons of CO2 annually. Baker Hughes will act as an overall solution provider for SGC, overseeing construction and startup of the facility as well as supplying compression equipment, digital monitoring systems and multiple services. 

TPS was also awarded several LNG contracts in the fourth quarter, booking an order with longtime partner Qatar Petroleum for power generation equipment for the North Field East LNG project following the third quarter order for the main refrigerant compressors. 

The Digital Solutions segment secured a major contract with Petrobras as a follow up to a third quarter award for a three-year frame agreement. The fourth quarter contract will provide a suite of digital solutions and services to optimize productivity, reduce operational and safety risks, and lower carbon emissions across Petrobras sites in Brazil. Petrobras will accelerate its digital transformation, adopting the latest Bently Nevada condition monitoring and protection platform as well as remote monitoring and diagnostics capability. The contract also includes Nexus Controls systems and cybersecurity solutions, flare monitoring and calibration technologies, and Flare.IQ advanced flare gas monitoring and optimization system.

Executing on Priorities 

The OFS Chemicals product line secured multiple upstream and downstream chemicals contracts, including a multi-year contract to provide hydrocarbon and water treatment services at one of the largest U.S. refineries. In Asia, Chemicals secured multiple contracts in Thailand, China, Australia, and Malaysia, providing additional regional volume as OFS plans to open its first chemicals manufacturing facility in the region in 2022.

TPS secured several upgrade orders for the supply of high efficiency compression equipment to help extend the field life of projects in the North Sea, Sub-Saharan Africa and in North West Kazakhstan for the Karachaganak Expansion Project-1A operated by Karachaganak Petroleum Operating B.V. Baker Hughes high pressure-reinjection compressors will be used within the 5th Injection Compressor facility, thus helping to extend the duration of the liquid production plateau.

DS secured several North American contracts to enhance operations, improve productivity and drive digital transformation across the energy sector. The Bently Nevada product line secured a contract with a major hydroelectric operator in the U.S. to provide its Orbit 60 system, System 1 software and a five-year services agreement for industrial asset management across multiple dams. Bently Nevada will also provide its System 1 software to American Electric Power (AEP) for several plants in its generation fleet, allowing AEP to monitor live data from and diagnose issues as needed. 

DS also continued to expand in industrial end markets. The Waygate Technologies (WT) business secured a significant order with a global leading Asian automaker for its latest Phoenix Speedscan HD system, providing automated inline computed tomography to inspect aluminum cylinder heads for automotive engines. In the aerospace market, WT developed an ‘intelligent borescope’ solution with Rolls-Royce, significantly reducing the time to inspect a jet engine and offering integration between the borescope, app, and turning tool that has not been available to the segment before. The Druck product line also secured multiple military aerospace contracts in Europe, Asia, and North America for aircraft sensors and instrumentation.

Leading with Innovation

Baker Hughes continued to develop technologies to advance the energy transition, improve efficiencies, and reduce emissions for customers. The Company acquired Compact Carbon Capture (3C), a pioneering technology development company specializing in carbon capture solutions. The acquisition underpins Baker Hughes’ strategic commitment to lead in the energy transition and provide differentiated decarbonization solutions for carbon-intensive industries.

Baker Hughes also announced a joint service offering with Wurth Industry North America (WINA) to expand additive manufacturing solutions for Wurth’s 80,000+ global customers. Together, WINA and Baker Hughes will provide advanced design, digital inventory, and customized 3D printing services in a range of industrial applications. Through 3D printing at scale, customers are capable of supply chain logistics-related emissions by moving production closer to the point of consumption.

OFE launched engageSubsea remote, an extension of its engageSubsea platform. EngageSubsea provides a single platform for equipment inspection, operational management and technical support, driving operational excellence and increasing capital productivity for offshore oil and gas operations. The latest remote capabilities further allow operators to cut costs, reduce downtime, improve efficiency, and minimize safety and travel risks. EngageSubsea remote is already a proven technology with live deployments with customers in the Norwegian Continental Shelf and at Baker Hughes services facilities.

DS launched the world’s fastest pressure controller from Druck, known as PACE CM3, as well as Druck’s next generation of pressure sensors, the ADROIT6000. Druck’s technological leadership in pressure sensor solutions continues to deliver exceptional performance and class-leading reliability and stability for customers across multiple industrial markets. 

The BakerHughesC3.ai joint venture alliance (BHC3) continued to see interest in AI-based software. In the fourth quarter, a Malaysian-based company adopted BCH3’s technology to detect failure and improve maintenance decisions on gas compressors and control valves. In addition, a Latin American customer adopted BHC3 Reliability to further improve the early warning systems and scheduled maintenance of ESPs.
