BOSTON, Mass. — January 26, 2021 — GE (NYSE:GE) announced its fourth quarter and full year 2020 results.

GE Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. said, “As 2020 progressed, we significantly improved GE's profitability and cash performance despite a still-difficult macro environment. The fourth quarter marked a strong free cash flow finish to a challenging year, reflecting the results of better operations as well as strong and improving orders in Power and Renewable Energy."

Culp continued, “Over the past year our team proved resilient, and momentum is growing across our businesses. We are in leading positions to capture opportunities in the energy transition, precision health, and the future of flight. As we continue our transformation, we remain focused on strengthening GE and delivering value for the long term.” 

GE made meaningful progress in 2020 on its priorities:

•Supporting the fight against COVID-19: Quadrupled ventilator production capacity and increased manufacturing capacity of other technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Supported 3,900 employees and their families through GE's Employee Relief Fund and supported global and community health and disaster relief efforts through the GE Foundation.

•Accelerating lean transformation: Reflected in improved results, including sequential margin expansion throughout the year and positive free cash flow. Realized more than $2 billion in cost actions and $3 billion in cash actions, in line with 2020 targets. 

•Investing in leading technology and delivering for customers: Supplied the first purpose-built hydrogen-burning power plant in the U.S. with Gas Power's 7HA.02 turbine. Secured the first order for Renewable Energy's Haliade-X offshore wind turbine, which is now capable of generating up to 14 MW and has 5.7 GW of commitments. Received U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification of Aviation's GE9X engine, the world’s most powerful aircraft engine. Launched more than 40 new Healthcare products, including enhancing Mural Virtual Care Solution, which provides a complete view of patients' status across a care area, hospital, or system. 

•Solidifying financial position: Reduced debt by $16 billion in 2020 and by $30 billion since the beginning of 2019. Reduced near-term liquidity needs by $10.5 billion, ending 2020 with $37 billion of liquidity. Closed sales of BioPharma and GE Lighting and launched program to fully monetize remaining stake in Baker Hughes.

•Continuing to build and empower world-class team: Appointed new CFO; CEOs of Aviation, Power Portfolio, and GE Capital; Chief Diversity Officer; Chief Audit Executive; and leaders throughout businesses and functions, including in commercial, supply chain, services, lean, and inclusion and diversity roles. Invested in new, virtual leadership development courses and lean training for employees.

Total Company Results

We present both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to provide investors with additional information. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures along with GAAP measures allows for increased comparability of our ongoing performance from period to period. Please see pages 10-17 for explanations of why we use these non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a- Excludes non-operating benefit costs, gains (losses), restructuring & other charges, Steam asset impairments, SEC settlement charge, goodwill impairments and U.S. tax reform 

(b- Excludes interest and other financial charges, non-op benefit costs, gains (losses), Steam asset impairments, SEC settlement charge, goodwill impairments and restructuring & other charges

Recent company updates include:

•As previously reported, GE launched a program in the third quarter of 2020 to fully monetize its Baker Hughes position over approximately three years. GE is receiving additional proceeds of $0.7 billion in January, for a total of approximately $1.2 billion to date, reducing GE's remaining interest in Baker Hughes to 30.1%.

•In the fourth quarter of 2020, GE reached a settlement with the SEC that concluded and resolved the SEC's investigation of GE in its entirety. Consistent with common SEC practice, GE neither admits nor denies the findings in an administrative order that the SEC issued in connection with the settlement. Under the settlement, among other terms, GE paid a civil penalty of $0.2 billion in December 2020, of which $0.1 billion was recorded at Corporate and $0.1 billion was recorded at GE Capital.

As part of GE's continued efforts to align its financial statements with the way it operates the company, and for improved comparability with peers and best practices, GE voluntarily elected to implement the below-referenced financial reporting changes in the fourth quarter of 2020. These changes are reflected in all periods presented in GE's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings presentation and will be reflected in GE's 2020 10-K. 

•Changed presentation of GE Industrial restructuring program costs: To drive increased visibility and accountability for restructuring expense in GE's businesses, this will now be included in segment profit and adjusted EPS, except for significant, higher-cost programs that continue to be recorded within Corporate Items and Eliminations. This change better aligns restructuring expense with cash spend at the segments, driving accountability in both managing costs and benefits. 

•Classification of Statement of Financial Position (current and non-current) and revised working capital definition: To drive increased transparency to operational drivers for near- and long-term cash needs and enhanced linkage to Free Cash Flow metrics. 

•Presentation of research and development (R&D) expenses separately as part of costs and expenses in consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss): Provides increased transparency to R&D spend and trends as part of GE's total investment in innovation. 

•Ceased reporting GE Capital as an equity method investment within the GE Industrial column of financial statements: The GE Industrial column now contains only the earnings and cash flows of GE Industrial. This change has no impact on the GE Capital or Consolidated columns. All commercial transactions between GE Industrial and GE Capital continue to be reported on arms-length terms and are eliminated upon consolidation.

2021 Outlook

GE announced the following total company outlook for full-year 2021: 

•GE Industrial revenues* to grow organically in the low-single-digit range. 

•Adjusted GE Industrial profit margin* to expand organically by 250-plus basis points. 

•Adjusted earnings per share* of $0.15 to $0.25. 

•GE Industrial free cash flow* of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. 

GE's 2021 outlook reflects a reduction in cash and profit from businesses that were disposed in 2020 (primarily BioPharma) as well as continued reduction of Baker Hughes shareholder dividends in line with the orderly sale of GE's remaining stake. In the first quarter of 2020, BioPharma generated nearly $300 million* in cash and $400 million in profit, and GE received more than $250 million in Baker Hughes dividends in 2020. This outlook also assumes Aviation revenue being flat to up year-over-year, which is dependent on the Commercial Aviation market recovery accelerating in the second half of 2021 as well as the timing of aircraft deliveries. GE expects to improve operational performance in Power and Renewable Energy, with continued strength in Healthcare and better Capital earnings compared to 2020. GE also expects to achieve a GE Industrial net debt*/EBITDA* ratio of less than 2.5x over time and GE Capital remains committed to maintaining a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 4x.

GE will hold an Investor Update on Wednesday, March 10, 2021, with additional details on its 2021 outlook, including by segment.

Results by Reporting Segment

The following segment discussions and variance explanations are intended to reflect management’s view of the relevant comparisons of financial results.

Power

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $5.6 billion were up 26% reported and 27% organically, with Gas Power equipment and service orders growth more than offsetting a decrease in Power Portfolio orders, which was largely driven by our decision to exit new build coal. Orders included 36 gas turbines, including 15 HA units and 2 aeroderivative units. Revenues of $5.4 billion were flat reported and down 1% organically*, with Gas Power down 3% organically* and Power Portfolio up 5% organically*. Segment profit of $0.3 billion was up 3% reported and 6% organically*, with all Power Portfolio businesses generating profit and Gas Power fixed costs* down 12%, partly offset by negative revenue mix as well as charges related to contracts and a specific customer credit event. Gas Power's cost measures and operational improvements enabled it to deliver positive FCF* in the year, one year ahead of its commitment. The team is focused on margin expansion and continuing to drive cost out.

Renewable Energy[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $6.3 billion were up 34% reported and 32% organically, driven by large Onshore Wind equipment orders in North America as well as the team’s first Haliade-X order in Offshore Wind. Revenues of $4.4 billion were down 6% reported and 7% organically*, mainly driven by more heavily weighted Onshore Wind deliveries last quarter. The Renewable Energy team delivered 1,013 new unit turbines and 146 repower upgrades in the quarter, with Onshore Wind delivering record volume in the year. Segment profit of negative $0.1 billion was up 62%, primarily driven by improved pricing and project execution. Renewable Energy ended 2020 with a record-high $30 billion backlog and is focused on continuing to improve its cost structure, project execution, and deal selectivity.

Aviation[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $6.3 billion were down 41% reported and 40% organically, with declines of approximately 21% in Commercial Engines and 52% in Commercial Services. Revenues of $5.8 billion were down 35% reported and 34% organically*, with equipment down driven by 309 fewer commercial engine sales year over year, including sales of 193 LEAP-1A and -1B units down 227 from last year largely due to lower 737 MAX production. Services revenues were also down, primarily due to lower commercial spare part shipments and decreased shop visits, and military revenues were flat. Segment profit of $0.6 billion was down 73% reported and 72% organically*, but grew sequentially primarily due to cost actions and improved volume in commercial end markets. Decremental margins were 48%. 

*Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

4

Healthcare[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $5.0 billion were down 15% reported and up 1% organically, with the difference largely due to the disposition of BioPharma. Healthcare Systems was up 1% organically with strength in Europe and China, and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics was down 1% organically. Revenues of $4.8 billion were down 11% reported and up 6% organically*, primarily driven by growth in Life Care Solutions including strong delivery of Carescape R860 ventilators as well as Imaging and Ultrasound volumes. Segment profit of $0.9 billion was down 17% reported and up 27% organically*, primarily due to cost reductions and increases in Healthcare Systems volume. 

GE Capital[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Continuing operations generated a net loss of $0.2 billion in the quarter. This was worse than prior year by $0.2 billion, with $0.1 billion driven by GE Capital's portion of the 2020 SEC settlement and the remainder by lower gains at GECAS and EFS, debt tender costs and taxes, partially offset by lower impairments at EFS and positive marks on the investment portfolio at Insurance. GE Capital continuing operations ended the year with $113.5 billion of assets, including $13.4 billion of liquidity. 

As previously shared, in the fourth quarter, GE provided a capital contribution to GE Capital of $2 billion, in line with required annual Insurance statutory funding for 2020. The company expects an additional contribution from GE to GE Capital in 2021 to meet its existing insurance statutory funding requirement of approximately $2 billion. In light of the uncertain environment, further 2021 contributions depend on GE Capital’s performance, including GECAS operations and the Insurance statutory cash flow test results.

(a)Segment revenues include sales of products and services related to the segment. Segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs and other charges, the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries. Segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges, non-operating benefit costs, income taxes, and preferred stock dividends according to how a particular segment's management is measured – excluded in determining segment profit for Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation and Healthcare; included in determining segment profit, which we sometimes refer to as "net earnings," for Capital. Other income is included in segment profit for the industrial segments. Certain corporate costs, such as those related to shared services, employee benefits and information technology are allocated to our segments based on usage. A portion of the remaining corporate costs is allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations. Total segment revenues and profit include the sum of our four industrial segments and one financial services segment, without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments. We believe that this provides investors with a view as to the results of all of our segments, without inter-segment eliminations and corporate items.

(a)Excluded $0.5 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in GE Capital insurance entities, which is subject to regulatory restrictions. This balance is included in All other assets.

(b)GE Capital cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $13.4 billion at December 31, 2020, including $0.2 billion which was subject to regulatory restrictions. Under the terms of an agreement between GE Capital and GE Industrial, GE Capital has the right to compel GE Industrial to borrow under the $15.0 billion unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility. Under this agreement, GE Industrial would transfer the proceeds to GE Capital as intercompany loans, which would be subject to the same terms and conditions as those between GE Industrial and the lending banks. GE Capital has not exercised this right. 

(c)Balance included consolidated restricted cash of $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. GE Industrial restricted cash was $0.4 billion and $0.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and GE Capital restricted cash was insignificant and $0.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

(d)GE Industrial borrowings includes commercial paper of zero and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. GE Capital borrowings has no commercial paper at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

(e)At December 31, 2020 the remaining GE Capital borrowings that had been assumed by GE Industrial as part of the GE Capital Exit Plan was $22.4 billion, for which GE Industrial has an offsetting receivable from GE Capital of $19.2 billion. The difference of $3.2 billion represents the amount of borrowings GE Capital has funded with available cash to GE Industrial via an intercompany loan in lieu of issuing borrowings externally.

(f)At December 31, 2020, total GE Industrial borrowings is comprised of GE Industrial-issued borrowings of $20.3 billion and the $3.2 billion of borrowings from GE Capital as described in note (e) above for a total of $23.5 billion.

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY

Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP

We believe that presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. This includes adjustments in recent periods to GAAP financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business.

In addition, management recognizes that certain non-GAAP terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. In various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-GAAP financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically GE Industrial organic revenues by segment; Gas Power organic revenues; and Power Portfolio organic revenues, (2) costs, specifically Gas Power fixed costs, (3) profit, specifically GE Industrial organic profit and profit margin by segment; Adjusted GE Industrial profit and profit margin (excluding certain items); Adjusted earnings (loss); and Adjusted earnings (loss) per share (EPS), (4) cash flows, specifically GE Industrial free cash flows (FCF) and BioPharma FCF, (5) debt balances, specifically, GE Industrial net debt and GE Industrial net debt/EBITDA ratio and (6) outlook, specifically 2021 Adjusted EPS; and 2021 GE Industrial free cash flows.

The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures follow. Certain columns, rows or percentages within these reconciliations may not add or recalculate due to the use of rounded numbers. Totals and percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.

Earnings-per-share amounts are computed independently. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total.

The service cost for our pension and other benefit plans are included in adjusted earnings*, which represents the ongoing cost of providing pension benefits to our employees. The components of non-operating benefit costs are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance. We believe the retained costs in Adjusted earnings* and Adjusted EPS* provides management and investors a useful measure to evaluate the performance of the total company and increases period-to-period comparability. We also use Adjusted EPS* as a performance metric at the company level for our annual executive incentive plan for 2020. We believe presenting Adjusted Industrial earnings* and Adjusted Industrial EPS* separately for our financial services businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company.

2021 OPERATING FRAMEWORK: 2021 ADJUSTED EPS (NON-GAAP)

We cannot provide a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and corresponding GAAP measure for Adjusted EPS* in 2021 without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty of timing of any gains or losses related to acquisitions & dispositions, the timing and magnitude of the financial impact related to the mark-to-market of our remaining investment in Baker Hughes, and the timing and magnitude of restructuring expenses. Although we have attempted to estimate the amount of gains and restructuring charges for the purpose of explaining the probable significance of these components, this calculation involves a number of unknown variables, resulting in a GAAP range that we believe is too large and variable to be meaningful.

2021 OPERATING FRAMEWORK: 2021 GE INDUSTRIAL FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP)

We cannot provide a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and corresponding GAAP measure for GE Industrial Free Cash flow* in 2021 without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty of timing of deal taxes related to business sales.
