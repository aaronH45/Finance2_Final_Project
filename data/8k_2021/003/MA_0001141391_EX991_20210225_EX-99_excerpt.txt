Mastercard Updates First-Quarter 2021 Operating Metrics

Purchase, N.Y. - February 25, 2021 - Mastercard today is updating its operating metrics through the week ending February 21. We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic and related actions being taken by governments as it relates to border restrictions, social distancing measures and business operations, and the resultant impact on spending. We are seeing spending levels remain relatively steady to what they were earlier in the quarter, while year over year growth rates have improved modestly as we begin to lap the initial effects of the pandemic. We believe that most markets remain in the Normalization phase domestically, with some approaching Growth.* Progress through the phases may not be linear and we continue to monitor the situation closely. 

The table below shows weekly growth trends of certain operating metrics versus the comparable year ago period.

Additional commentary:

•Switched Volume continues to be relatively steady so far this quarter, with year over year growth rates modestly improving through the first half of February as we begin to lap the initial effects of the pandemic.

◦From a geographic perspective, in the United States spending levels have benefited from fiscal stimulus and have been relatively steady throughout the quarter with the exception of some fall off in the week ending February 21 related to the inclement weather. Outside the U.S., spending levels continue to be relatively consistent with what they were through the week ending January 21.

•Switched Transactions remain steady and are tracking the trends we see in Switched Volume.  

•Cross-Border Volume growth rates have shown a modest improvement as we begin to lap the start of the pandemic, particularly in Asia-Pacific and Europe. Consistent with recent trends, we continue to see strong growth in card not present cross border volumes, excluding online travel-related spend, while card present and travel-related card not present volumes continue to be more heavily impacted. 

*In 2020, the company introduced a four-phase structure for monitoring spending levels related to the COVID-19 pandemic - Containment, Stabilization, Normalization and Growth.
