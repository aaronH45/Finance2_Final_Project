Fourth-Quarter Business Overview

Worldwide Nutrition sales increased 3.6 percent on a reported basis and 4.4 percent on an organic basis in the fourth quarter.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Worldwide Diagnostics sales increased 111.1 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter and increased 108.9 percent on an organic basis. Strong growth in the quarter was driven by demand for Abbott's portfolio of COVID-19 diagnostics tests across its rapid and lab-based platforms. Global COVID-19 testing-related sales were $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, led by combined sales of $1.9 billion from Abbott's BinaxNOW, Panbio and ID NOW rapid testing platforms.

Worldwide Medical Devices sales increased 1.7 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter and decreased 0.4 percent on an organic basis. Strong growth in Diabetes Care, led by FreeStyle Libre, was offset by reduced cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedure volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower Vascular sales in China, as a result of a new national tender program in that country. Excluding Vascular sales in China, global Vascular sales decreased 10.4 percent on an organic basis, and Medical Devices sales increased 1.4 percent on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. 

In Diabetes Care, strong growth in the quarter was led by FreeStyle Libre, which grew 41.3 percent on a reported basis and 37.1 percent on an organic basis. For the full year, FreeStyle Libre grew 43.1 percent on a reported basis and 42.6 percent on an organic basis.
