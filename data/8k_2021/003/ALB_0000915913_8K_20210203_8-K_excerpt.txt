Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On February 3, 2021, Albemarle Corporation (“we” or the “Company”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as representative of the several underwriters named therein (the “Underwriters”), relating to an underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of 8,496,733 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”). The public offering price was $153.00 per share of Common Stock, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Common Stock pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement at a price of $148.7925 per share of Common Stock. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company also granted to the Underwriters an option, exercisable in whole or in part at any time for a period of 30 days from the date of the Underwriting Agreement, to purchase up to an additional 1,274,509 shares of Common Stock from the Company at a price of $148.7925 per share of Common Stock (the “Option”). On February 4, 2021, the Underwriters exercised the Option in full.

The Offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-234547) and a related prospectus supplement dated February 3, 2021 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 5, 2021. A copy of the legal opinion of Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP relating to the validity of the shares of Common Stock in the Offering is filed as Exhibit 5.1 hereto.

The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $1,453 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the Company and the Underwriters, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, other obligations of the parties and termination provisions. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the Company and its executive officers and directors have agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of Common Stock held by them for a period ending 90 days after the date of the Underwriting Agreement without first obtaining the written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.

The foregoing description of the terms of the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Underwriting Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. Accordingly, the Underwriting Agreement is incorporated herein by reference only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding the Company or its business, and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures in the Company’s periodic reports and other filings with the SEC.

Item 8.01. Other Events.

On February 3, 2021, the Company issued a press release announcing the pricing of the Offering. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. 

On February 8, 2021, the Company completed the Offering, including the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Option.
