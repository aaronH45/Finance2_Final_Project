Discussion of results:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth quarter 2020 vs. third quarter 2020  

Net interest income of $1.1 billion decreased 1% given lower asset yields and lower loan balances, largely in commercial driven by line of credit repayments and payoffs outpacing originations, partially offset by improved funding mix and lower deposit costs.  

   •    

Net interest margin of 2.75% decreased 8 basis points reflecting a 9 basis point impact from elevated cash balances given strong deposit flows. Results also include lower earning-asset yields that were partially offset by the impact of disciplined deposit pricing actions, improved funding mix and the start of PPP forgiveness. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 8 basis points.  

   •    

Excluding the impact of elevated cash balances, net interest margin would have been approximately 2.92% for fourth quarter 2020 and 2.91% for third quarter 2020.  

Fourth quarter 2020 vs. fourth quarter 2019  

Net interest income of $1.1 billion decreased 1% as 10% growth in interest-earning assets, including the addition of PPP loans, and improvements in funding mix and deposit pricing were more than offset by the lower rate and challenging yield curve environment.  

   •    

Net interest margin of 2.75% decreased 31 basis points, primarily reflecting the impact of lower interest rates (29 basis points) and elevated cash balances (17 basis points) given strong deposit flows, partially offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing (19 basis points). Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 82 basis points, reflecting strong pricing discipline.

Other income includes bank-owned life insurance and other income.  

Fourth quarter 2020 vs. third quarter 2020  

Noninterest income of $578 million decreased $76 million, or 12%, from the $654 million record in third quarter 2020.  

   •    

Mortgage banking fees declined 33% from record levels given lower gain-on-sale margins reflecting an increase in industry capacity, and lower mortgage servicing rights hedging results. Production volumes remained near record levels.  

   •    

Several categories saw growth:  

   •    

Record capital markets fees were up 52%, driven by higher M&A advisory and loan syndication fees.  

   •    

Foreign exchange and interest rate products revenue was up 30%, reflecting higher customer activity levels tied to increased variable rate loan originations.  

   •    

Service charges and fees were up 7%, given continued recovery from COVID-19 impacts.  

   •    

Other income declined from a third quarter 2020 level that included a gain on sale of education loans.  

Fourth quarter 2020 vs. fourth quarter 2019  

Noninterest income of $578 million increased $84 million, or 17%, reflecting:  

   •    

Strong growth in mortgage banking fees, up $113 million, driven by higher production volumes and gain-on-sale margins.  

   •    

Record capital market fees, up 33%, reflect an increase in M&A advisory and loan syndication fees.  

   •    

These results were partially offset by lower service charges and fees, and card fees reflecting COVID-19 impacts, and lower foreign exchange and interest rate products revenue reflecting lower loan originations, less volatility and smaller CVA benefit.

Fourth quarter 2020 vs. third quarter 2020  

Noninterest expense of $1.0 billion increased $24 million, or 2%. On an Underlying basis, noninterest expense of $970 million increased 1% reflecting higher compensation expense and outside services tied to strong Consumer-related volumes and seasonal impacts, partially offset by continued expense discipline.  

The effective tax rate was 20.2%. On an Underlying basis, the effective tax rate of 21.7% compares with 16.8%, which reflected the greater impact of tax-advantaged investments given lower pre-tax income.  

Fourth quarter 2020 vs. fourth quarter 2019  

Noninterest expense of $1.0 billion increased $26 million, or 3%. Underlying noninterest expense of $970 million was up 2% given strong expense discipline and benefit of the TOP program. Increases in compensation expense, reflecting strong mortgage production volumes, higher equipment and software expense, given continued investments in technology, and higher outside services largely tied to growth initiatives, were partially offset by a decrease in other operating expense, given lower travel and advertising costs.  

On an Underlying basis, the effective tax rate of 21.7% compares with 21.5%.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations  

(in millions, except share, per-share and ratio data)  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:  

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as Underlying results. Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which Management does not consider indicative of the Company’s on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by our Management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results. The following tables present reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements  

This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements regarding potential future share repurchases and future dividends, as well as the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on our business, operations, financial performance and prospects, are forward-looking statements. Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “targets,” “initiatives,” “potentially,” “probably,” “projects,” “outlook” or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and “could.”  

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation:  

   •    

Negative economic and political conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of nonperforming assets, charge-offs and provision expense;  

   •    

The rate of growth in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions, and changes in the competitive environment;  

   •    

Our ability to implement our business strategy, including the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our financial performance goals;  

   •    

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns and their effect on the economic and business environments in which we operate;  

   •    

Our ability to meet heightened supervisory requirements and expectations;  

   •    

Liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations;  

   •    

Our capital and liquidity requirements under regulatory capital standards and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;  

   •    

The effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale;  

   •    

Changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets;  

   •    

The effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;  

   •    

Financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses;  

   •    

A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks; and  

   •    

Management’s ability to identify and manage these and other risks.  

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the actual amounts and timing of any future common stock dividends or  

share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, and regulatory and accounting considerations, as well as any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares or pay any dividends to holders of

Citizens Financial Group, Inc.  

 our common stock, or as to the amount of any such repurchases or dividends. Further, statements about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on our business, operations, financial performance and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual impacts may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, third parties and us.  

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking  

statements can be found under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020.
