The foregoing description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Amendments and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Amendments, copies of which will be filed as exhibits to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “Form 10-K”).

2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans

On February 10, 2021, the Company entered into (i) a 364-day term loan agreement (the “2021 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement”) for a new 1.1 billion EUR (approximately $1.3 billion at the date of signing) (the “2021 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan”) and (ii) a 3-year term loan agreement (the “2021 Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement,” and, together with the 2021 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement, the “2021 Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreements”) for a new 825.0 million EUR (approximately $1.0 billion at the date of signing) (the “2021 Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan,” and, together with the 2021 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan, the “2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans”), each with Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent (as defined therein), TD Securities (USA), LLC and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. as Syndication Agents (each as defined therein) and BofA Securities, Inc., TD Securities (USA), LLC, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Barclays Bank PLC, Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., RBC Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley MUFG Loan Partners, LLC (acting through Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc and MUFG Bank, Ltd.), as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners (each as defined therein), with certain of such banks also acting as Co-Documentation Agents (as defined therein). 

The 2021 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan matures one year from the date of the first draw thereunder and bears interest at a rate based on the senior unsecured debt rating of the Company, which, based on Company's current debt ratings, is 1.000% above the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The 2021 Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan matures three years from the date of the first draw thereunder and bears interest at a rate based on the senior unsecured debt rating of the Company, which, based on Company's current debt ratings, is 1.125% above EURIBOR. The the net proceeds from the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans are to be used to fund the Pending Telxius Transaction. All outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the Company’s option without penalty or premium.

The 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreements contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the Company and its subsidiaries must comply, including the following two financial maintenance tests (each of the capitalized terms as defined in the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreements):

i.a Company total leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of no greater than 7.50 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters following the consummation of the Pending Telxius Acquisition, stepping down to 6.00 to 1.00 thereafter (with a further step up to 7.00 to 1.00 if the Company consummates a Qualified Acquisition); and 

ii.a senior secured leverage ratio (Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00 for the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreements may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.

Certain of the lenders under the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreements and other parties to the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreements or their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, commercial banking, underwriting, lending, investment banking and financial advisory services in the ordinary course of business for the Company, its subsidiaries and certain of its affiliates, for which they have received or will receive customary fees and commissions.
