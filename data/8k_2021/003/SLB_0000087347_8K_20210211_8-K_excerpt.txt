Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  

The presentation referred to above contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws — that is, statements that are not historical facts. Such statements often contain words such as “expect,” “may,” “can,” “believe,” “predict,” “plan,” “estimate,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “think,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “will,” “see,” “likely,” and other similar words. Forward-looking statements address matters that are, to varying degrees, uncertain, such as such as the extent to which alternative energy sources, including hydrogen, geo-energy, and geothermal, will contribute to the world’s future energy demands; zero emissions goals; anticipated annual investment in renewable and alternative energy development; anticipated growth of the new energy economy; and other forecasts or expectations regarding global climate change. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the level of acceptance of various renewable and alternative energy sources in global decarbonization; the inability to achieve net zero goals; the inability to recognize intended benefits of Schlumberger New Energy’s business strategies and initiatives; the inability to produce hydrogen, geothermal or other alternative energies at costs competitive to other sources of energy; legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in Schlumberger’s most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filed with or furnished to the SEC. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize (or the consequences of any such development changes), or should our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the presentation, and Schlumberger disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
