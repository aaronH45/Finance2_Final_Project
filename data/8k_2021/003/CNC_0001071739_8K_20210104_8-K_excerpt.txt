  Item 1.01.   Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.     

On January 4, 2021, Centene Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Mayflower Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Magellan Health, a Delaware corporation (“Magellan Health”). Among other things, the Merger Agreement provides, subject to the satisfaction or, where permissible, waiver of the conditions to closing set forth therein, for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Magellan Health (the “Merger”), with Magellan Health continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Surviving Corporation”). Each capitalized term used herein but not otherwise defined has the meaning given to it in the Merger Agreement. 

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Magellan Health (the “Magellan Health Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) (other than any shares of Magellan Health Common Stock owned by Magellan Health, any shares of Magellan Health Common Stock owned by the Company or Merger Sub, any shares of Magellan Health Common Stock as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised, and shares of Magellan Health Common Stock underlying restricted stock awards of Magellan Health) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $95.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). 

At the Effective Time, each outstanding Magellan Health restricted stock award held by a nonemployee Magellan director will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Each outstanding Magellan Health restricted stock award (other than those held by nonemployee directors), time-based restricted stock unit, performance-based restricted stock unit, stock option and phantom cash unit will be converted at such time into a corresponding Company award, in each case, that is governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Magellan Health equity award immediately prior to the Effective Time, with an equivalent fair market value determined in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (with Magellan Health performance-based restricted stock units converting at the target level of performance into Company time-based restricted stock units). 

As of the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will become the directors of the Surviving Corporation. 

The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Magellan Health’s stockholders, (ii) the receipt of U.S. federal antitrust clearance and certain other specified required regulatory filings and approvals, (iii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iv) the absence of a material adverse effect on Magellan Health, (v) no remedies that would have a material adverse effect on Magellan Health, the Company or the combined company are conditions to or a part of the U.S. federal antitrust clearance and other specified required regulatory approvals, (vi) the representations and warranties of Magellan Health, the Company and Merger Sub being true and correct, subject to the materiality standards contained in the Merger Agreement and (vii) the Company, Merger Sub and Magellan Health having complied in all material respects with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement. 

The Company and Magellan Health each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including the obligation of Magellan Health to use reasonable best efforts to conduct its businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and to refrain from taking specified actions without the consent of the Company. The parties have generally agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the required regulatory approvals for the transaction, including covenants by the Company to agree to take any and all actions (including divestiture actions) necessary to obtain the required regulatory approvals other than (i) commencing or defending litigation (except certain administrative appeals) or (ii) any action that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (x) the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) Magellan Health and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (z) the combined company, taken as a whole (with the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the combined company, taken as a whole, being deemed for these purposes to be of the size, scope and scale of Magellan Health and its subsidiaries, taken as whole). 

The Merger Agreement also contains a covenant restricting Magellan Health’s ability to solicit competing acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions designed to allow the board of directors of Magellan Health to fulfill its fiduciary duties. 

The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Magellan Health, including (i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before the “outside date” of October 4, 2021 (subject to extension to January 4, 2022 under certain circumstances), (ii) if the required approval of the Magellan Health stockholders is not obtained, (iii) if the other party materially breaches its representations, warranties or covenants and fails to cure such breach or (iv) if any law or order prohibiting the Merger has become final and non-appealable. 

The Merger Agreement may also be terminated (i) by the Company if the board of directors of Magellan Health changes its recommendation or if Magellan Health willfully breaches in any material respect its nonsolicitation obligations in the Merger Agreement which, cannot be cured prior to Magellan Health’s stockholder meeting or, if curable prior to Magellan Health’s stockholder meeting, is not cured within 10 business days after the Company delivers written notice thereof and (ii) by Magellan Health, subject to compliance with certain terms of the Merger Agreement, in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal. 

Magellan Health will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $76,530,000 in the following circumstances: (i) if Magellan Health terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal; (ii) if the board of directors of Magellan Health changes its recommendation in connection with a superior proposal or an intervening event; (iii) if Magellan Health willfully breaches in any material respect its nonsolicitation obligations in the Merger Agreement which, cannot be cured prior to Magellan Health’s stockholder meeting or, if curable prior to Magellan Health’s stockholder meeting, is not cured within 10 business days after the Company delivers written notice thereof; or (iv) if the required vote of Magellan Health’s stockholders is not obtained when the Company would have otherwise been entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of the matters in the preceding clauses (ii) or (iii). 

In addition, if an acquisition proposal is made for Magellan Health, the Merger Agreement is later terminated under certain circumstances and within twelve months after termination Magellan Health enters into an agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or assets, Magellan Health will be required to pay the Company a fee of $76,530,000. 

In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, the Company has entered into a bridge financing commitment, dated January 4, 2021, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”), pursuant to which JPMorgan has committed to lend to the Company an amount up to $2,381,000,000 in the aggregate in the form of a senior unsecured bridge loan facility, subject to customary conditions as set forth therein. 

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The Merger Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or Magellan Health. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; are subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and are subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that may differ from those applicable to investors. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the Company and Magellan Health in connection with the negotiated terms of the Merger Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. Further, the Merger Agreement should not be read alone but instead should be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the Merger Agreement, the Merger, the Company, Magellan Health, their respective affiliates and their respective businesses that will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the proxy statement that will be filed with the SEC, as well as in the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other filings that the Company or Magellan Health may file with the SEC.
