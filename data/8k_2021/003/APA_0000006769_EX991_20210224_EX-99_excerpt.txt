HOUSTON, Feb. 24, 2021 – Apache Corporation (Nasdaq: APA) today announced its financial and operational results for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2020.  

Apache reported net income attributable to common stock of $10 million, or on a fully diluted basis, a loss of $16 million or $0.04 per share during the fourth-quarter 2020. When adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results, Apache’s fourth-quarter loss totaled $20 million or $0.05 on a diluted share basis. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $498 million, and adjusted EBITDAX was $630 million.

For the full-year 2020, Apache reported a loss of $4.9 billion, or $12.86 per diluted common share. On an adjusted basis, Apache’s 2020 loss totaled $407 million or $1.08 per diluted common share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion, and adjusted EBITDAX was $2.2 billion.  

“Apache’s fourth quarter was a positive conclusion to a challenging year. Commodity prices held firm, and we executed well on our production, capital spending and costs objectives while also delivering promising exploration results internationally,” said John J. Christmann IV, Apache’s chief executive officer and president.  

“Apache acted quickly and decisively in the face of the extreme market conditions early in 2020. Within three days of the March 9 oil price crash, we took aggressive and necessary measures to protect our financial position. As a result, we were able to absorb significant revenue losses relative to our original plan without further leveraging our balance sheet,” continued Christmann. “We exceeded our cost reduction goals while continuing to deliver excellent employee health, safety and environmental performance. I’m especially proud of our team’s swift response to the pandemic. To date, we have had no known cases of a COVID-19 transmission from one Apache employee or contractor to another.  

“It was also a banner year on the exploration front, as we announced three discoveries offshore Suriname, followed by a fourth discovery announced in January 2021, achieving a 100% success rate on Block 58 to date. We look forward to a continuation of the exploration program, as well as an appraisal program, which is now underway.”  

ESG Focus  

During the year, Apache developed and implemented robust COVID-19 employee safety protocols, provided pandemic assistance to the communities in which it operates and advanced diversity and inclusion programs. The company also enhanced its greenhouse gas data collection processes, expanded disclosures to more closely align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and increased ESG-related short-term incentive compensation weighting from 10% to 20%.

2021 Capital Budget and Outlook  

In 2021, Apache plans to invest $1.1 billion in upstream oil and gas capital, approximately $200 million for exploration and $900 million for production and development activities. This capital program will be more than fully funded by internally generated cash flow under an assumed price deck of $45 WTI oil and $3.00 Henry Hub natural gas.  

“Our strategic approach remains centered around capital discipline and flexibility. We have established a 2021 capital plan that prioritizes generating free cash flow for debt reduction,” Christmann said. “We will continue to aggressively manage our cost structure, focus on long-term returns over short-term growth, continuously progress our ESG efforts, and advance our global exploration activities, most notably offshore Suriname.”  

Year-End 2020 Proved Reserves  

Worldwide estimated proved reserves totaled 874 million BOE at year-end 2020. More than 91% of Apache’s estimated proved reserves at year-end 2020 were classified as proved developed. During the year, Apache added approximately 78 million BOE in field extensions and discoveries. Production and divestitures reduced proved reserves by 161 million and 9.6 million BOE, respectively. Negative price revisions, partially offset by positive performance revisions, further reduced proved reserves by 45 million BOE.

Additional Information  

Additional information follows, including reconciliations of adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDAX, upstream capital investment and net debt (non-GAAP financial measures) to GAAP measures and information regarding adjusted production. Apache’s quarterly supplement is available at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Apache’s financial information includes information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of our consolidated financial information as prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDAX, upstream capital investment and net debt are non-GAAP measures. This non-GAAP information should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “continues,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “guidance,” “may,” “might,” “outlook,” “possibly,” “potential,” “projects,” “prospects,” “should,” “will,” “would,” and similar references to future periods, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future plans, expectations and objectives for Apache’s operations, including statements about our capital plans, drilling plans, production expectations, asset sales, and monetizations. While forward-looking statements are

 based on assumptions and analyses made by us that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, whether actual results and developments will meet our expectations and predictions depend on a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results, performance, and financial condition to differ materially from our expectations. See “Risk Factors” in our 2019 Form 10-K and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed, and 2020 Form 10-K when filed, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for a discussion of risk factors that affect our business. Any forward-looking statement made by Apache in this news release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Apache undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future development or otherwise, except as may be required by law.  

Cautionary Note to Investors  

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable, and possible reserves that meet the SEC’s definitions for such terms. Apache may use certain terms in this news release, such as “resources,” “potential resources,” “resource potential,” “estimated net reserves,” “recoverable reserves,” and other similar terms that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit Apache from including in filings with the SEC. Such terms do not take into account the certainty of resource recovery, which is contingent on exploration success, technical improvements in drilling access, commerciality and other factors, and are therefore not indicative of expected future resource recovery and should not be relied upon. Investors are urged to consider carefully the disclosure in Apache’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2019 (and Apache’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2020, when filed) available from Apache at www.apachecorp.com or by writing Apache at: 2000 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 100, Houston, TX 77056 (Attn: Corporate Secretary). You can also obtain this report from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(In millions, except per share data)  

Reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted EBITDAX  

Management believes EBITDAX, or earnings before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense is a widely accepted financial indicator, and useful for investors, to assess a company’s ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to shareholders. We define adjusted EBITDAX, a non-GAAP financial measure, as EBITDAX adjusted for certain items presented in the accompanying reconciliation. Management uses adjusted EBITDAX to evaluate our ability to fund our capital expenditures, debt services and other operational requirements and to compare our results from period to period by eliminating the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be representative of the Company’s on-going operations. Management also believes adjusted EBITDAX facilitates investors and analysts in evaluating and comparing EBITDAX from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain operating expenses that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. However, our presentation of adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reconciliation of Income attributable to common stock to Adjusted earnings  

Our presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures because they exclude the effect of certain items included in Income Attributable to Common Stock. Management believes that adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share provides relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our management in assessing the Company’s operational trends and comparability of results to our peers.  

Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share to evaluate our operating and financial performance because it eliminates the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be representative of the Company’s on-going business operations. As a performance measure, adjusted earnings may be useful to investors in facilitating comparisons to others in the Company’s industry because certain items can vary substantially in the oil and gas industry from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of assets, capital structure and asset sales and other divestitures, among other factors. Management believes excluding these items facilitates investors and analysts in evaluating and comparing the underlying operating and financial performance of our business from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense and income items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. However, our presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.

The assumed conversion of Altus’ Preferred Unit limited partner is primarily associated with unrealized gains on the Preferred Unit embedded derivative. These amounts are antidilutive for the year ended 2020 and on an adjusted fourth quarter basis.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(In millions)  

Reconciliation of debt to net debt  

Net debt, or outstanding debt obligations less cash and cash equivalents, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses net debt as a measure of the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. The Altus Midstream LP credit facility is unsecured and is not guaranteed by Apache or any of Apache’s other subsidiaries.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reconciliation of Costs incurred to Upstream capital investment  

Management believes the presentation of upstream capital investments is useful for investors to assess Apache’s expenditures related to our upstream capital activity. We define capital investments as costs incurred for oil and gas activities, adjusted to exclude asset retirement obligation revisions and liabilities incurred, capitalized interest, and certain exploration expenses, while including amounts paid during the period for abandonment and decommissioning expenditures. Upstream capital expenditures attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt are also excluded. Management believes this provides a more accurate reflection of Apache’s cash expenditures related to upstream capital activity and is consistent with how we plan our capital budget.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Cash flows from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities  

Cash flows from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities is a non-GAAP financial measure. Apache uses it internally and provides the information because management believes it is useful for investors and widely accepted by those following the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a company’s ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities, fund dividend programs, and service debt. It is also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas exploration and production companies and is frequently included in published research when providing investment recommendations. Cash flows from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities, therefore, is an additional measure of liquidity but is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities.
