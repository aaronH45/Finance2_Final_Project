CEO Commentary:

"We are pleased with our performance throughout both the fourth quarter and the full year given the pandemic and economic challenges faced by our customers, colleagues, communities, and the country. We proactively managed through the continued low interest rate environment and unprecedented economic volatility experienced in the wake of the pandemic," said Steve Steinour, chairman, president, and CEO. "The economy in our footprint continues to strengthen as demonstrated by the strong close to the year in commercial lending, our increasing loan pipelines, and more broadly our conversations with our customers, many of whom are expressing optimism on the economic outlook."

"We delivered positive operating leverage for the eighth consecutive year, increased revenues 7% annually, and continued to invest in our revenue-driving businesses. Average loans increased 6%, and average core deposits increased 11%. A record year of mortgage originations and continued strong auto, RV, and marine loan originations, as well as the $6 billion of PPP loans, helped drive our 2020 results."

"Huntington enters 2021 on strong footing with momentum across our businesses. We believe this year provides an important opportunity to advance the strategic positioning and long-term financial performance of the company through investments in technology, digital innovation, marketing, and people, as well as our recently-announced acquisition of TCF Financial. We remain committed to delivering on our purpose to look out for people and executing our strategies to build the leading People-First, Digitally-Powered bank."

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Pages 7-9 and 18-20 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) net interest income for the 2020 fourth quarter increased $44 million, or 6%, from the 2019 fourth quarter. This reflected a $12.2 billion, or 12%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by an 18 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin (NIM) to 2.94%. The NIM compression reflected a 90 basis point decrease in average earning asset yields and a 25 basis point decrease in the benefit of non-interest bearing funding sources, partially offset by a 97 basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities. These decreases reflected the impact of lower interest rates and changes in balance sheet mix, including elevated deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank.

Compared to the 2020 third quarter, FTE net interest income increased $8 million, or 1%, reflecting the 1% increase in average earning assets partially offset by 2 basis points of NIM compression. The NIM compression reflected an 9 basis point decrease in average earning asset yields and a 5 basis point decrease in the benefit from noninterest-bearing funds, partially offset by a 12 basis point decrease in average interest-bearing liability costs. These decreases reflected the impact of lower interest rates and changes in balance sheet mix, including elevated deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Compared to the 2020 third quarter, interest income for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans decreased from $53 million to $49 million. The decrease was driven by a change in PPP loan terms to delay the initial repayment, reducing deferred loan fee amortization by $9 million, resulting in a 3 basis point decline in NIM. Further, deferred loan fees on PPP loans totaling $5 million were recognized upon receipt of forgiveness payments from the US Small Business Administration (SBA), resulting in a 2 basis point increase in NIM.

Table 3 – Average Earning Assets – C&I, Residential Mortgage, and RV and Marine Loan Growth Drive Year-over-Year Loan Growth

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Pages 7 and 18 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Average earning assets for the 2020 fourth quarter increased $12.2 billion, or 12%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting a $6.0 billion, or 8%, increase in average total loans and leases. Average commercial and industrial (C&I) loans increased $4.5 billion, or 15%, primarily reflecting $6.2 billion of average PPP loans, partially offset by a $0.9 billion decrease in dealer floorplan loans. Average residential mortgage loans increased $0.8 billion, or 7%, reflecting robust mortgage production in the second half of 2020. Average RV and marine loans increased $0.6 billion, or 17%, reflecting strong consumer demand and continued strong production levels. Average held-for-sale and other earning assets increased $5.2 billion, or 291%, primarily reflecting the $4.8 billion increase in interest bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. Average total securities increased $0.9 billion, or 4%, primarily reflecting the net purchase of securities during the 2020 fourth quarter and the $0.2 billion mark-to-market of the available-for-sale portfolio.

Compared to the 2020 third quarter, average earning assets increased $1.6 billion, or 1%, primarily reflecting a $1.2 billion, or 5%, increase in average securities. The increase in securities reflected purchases completed during the 2020 fourth quarter.

Table 4 – Average Liabilities – Demand Deposits Drive Continued Year-over-Year Growth in Core Deposits 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Pages 7 and 18 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Average total interest-bearing liabilities for the 2020 fourth quarter increased $3.7 billion, or 5%, from the year-ago quarter. Average total deposits increased $14.0 billion, or 17%, while average total core deposits increased $12.6 billion, or 16%. The increase in average total core deposits was primarily driven by business and commercial growth related to the PPP loans and increased liquidity levels in reaction to the economic downturn, consumer growth largely related to government stimulus, increased consumer and business banking account production, and reduced attrition. Specifically within core deposits, average total demand deposits increased $12.5 billion, or 31%, average savings and other domestic deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 20%, and average money market deposits increased $1.6 billion, or 6%. Average brokered deposits and negotiable CDs increased $1.5 billion, or 58%, reflecting balance growth in new and existing brokered deposit accounts. Partially offsetting these increases, average core CDs decreased $3.3 billion, or 69%, reflecting the maturity of balances related to the 2018 consumer deposit growth initiatives. Average total debt decreased $2.8 billion, or 24%, reflecting the repayment of short‐term borrowings, the maturity and issuance of $2.1 billion and $1.2 billion of long-term debt, respectively, over the past five quarters, and the purchase of $0.5 billion of long-term debt under the tender offer completed in November 2020, all due to the strong core deposit growth.

Compared to the 2020 third quarter, average total interest-bearing liabilities increased $0.4 billion, or less than 1%. Average total deposits increased $1.5 billion, or 2%, and average total core deposits increased $1.6 billion, or 2%. The increase in average total core deposits was primarily driven by increased liquidity levels among our commercial customers and improved consumer and business banking account retention. Specifically within core deposits, average total demand deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 4%, while average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion, or 27%, reflecting the maturity of the balances tied to the 2018 consumer deposit growth initiatives. Average long-term debt decreased $0.5 billion, or 6%, primarily reflecting the purchase of $0.5 billion of long-term debt under the tender offer completed in November 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Pages 10-11 and 21-22 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Noninterest income for the 2020 fourth quarter increased $37 million, or 10%, from the year-ago quarter. Mortgage banking income increased $32 million, or 55%, reflecting higher volume and overall salable spreads, partially offset by a $16 million decrease in income from net mortgage servicing rights (MSR) risk management. The 2020 fourth quarter included no net gains or losses on sales of securities, while the year-ago quarter included $22 million of net losses related to the $2 billion portfolio repositioning completed in the quarter. Service charges on deposits accounts decreased $17 million, or 18%, primarily reflecting reduced customer activity and elevated deposits.

Compared to the 2020 third quarter, total noninterest income decreased $21 million, or 5%. Mortgage banking income decreased $32 million, or 26%, primarily reflecting lower overall salable spreads and a $7 million decrease in income from net MSR risk management. Capital markets fees increased $7 million, or 26%, reflecting increased loan syndication fees and increased commodities and foreign exchange derivatives activity.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Pages 10 and 21 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Noninterest expense for the 2020 fourth quarter increased $55 million, or 8%, from the year-ago quarter. Outside data processing and other services expense increased $22 million, or 25%, primarily driven by expenses related to technology investments. Other noninterest expense increased $19 million, or 33%, primarily reflecting a $20 million donation to The Columbus Foundation and $7 million of expense from the November 2020 debt tender, partially offset by a $4 million final true-up of the earn out related to the Hutchinson, Shockey, Erley & Co. (HSE) acquisition in the year-ago quarter. Equipment expense increased $7 million, or 17%, primarily reflecting increased depreciation expense related to technology investments as well as $1 million of expense related to the branch and facilities consolidations announced in the 2020 third quarter. Professional services expense increased $7 million, or 50%, due to $8 million of TCF Financial Corporation ("TCF") merger-related expense. Marketing increased $6 million, or 67%, primarily reflecting strategic marketing campaigns. The 2020 fourth quarter and 2019 fourth quarter included $6 million and $25 million of total noninterest expense, respectively, related to the previously-announced position reductions and consolidation of branches and other corporate facilities.

Noninterest expense increased $44 million, or 6%, from the 2020 third quarter. Other noninterest expense increased $37 million, or 93%, primarily driven by a $20 million donation to The Columbus Foundation, $7 million of expense from the November 2020 debt tender, and the $7 million insurance recovery in the prior quarter. Outside data processing and other services expense increased $13 million, or 13%, primarily driven by expenses related to technology investments. Professional services expense increased $9 million, or 75%, due to $8 million of TCF merger-related expense. Marketing expense increased $6 million, or 67%, primarily reflecting strategic marketing campaigns. Partially offsetting these increases, personnel costs decreased $27 million, or 6%, primarily reflecting lower benefits costs and incentive compensation as well as an $11 million net decrease in expense related to previously-announced position reductions.

Credit Quality

Table 7 – Credit Quality Metrics – NCOs Remain Near High End of Average Through-the-Cycle Target Range

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Other nonperforming assets include certain impaired securities and/or nonaccrual loans held-for-sale. 

(2)Total NALs as a % of total loans and leases.

(3)Total NPAs as a % of sum of loans and leases, other real estate owned, and other NPAs.

See Pages 12-15 and 23-26 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Overall asset quality performance showed continued improvement for the second consecutive quarter. The majority of the charge-offs in 2020 were related to the Commercial portfolio, specifically the Oil and Gas component. The Consumer portion of the loan portfolio exhibited continued consistent asset quality performance.

Nonperforming assets (NPAs) were $563 million at 2020 year end. NPAs decreased $39 million, or 6%, on a linked quarter basis, and were $150 million, or 21%, lower than the 2020 peak at the end of the second quarter, driven by a reduction in the Oil and Gas portfolio. The resulting NPA ratio of 0.69% of total loans and leases and OREO as of 2020 year end shows a clear decline on a linked quarter basis and is only slightly higher than the 2019 year end ratio of 0.66%. On a linked quarter basis, nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) decreased $37 million, or 7%, to $532 million, while OREO and Other NPAs decreased slightly. The year-over-year increase in NALs was primarily in the C&I portfolio. OREO balances decreased $7 million, or 64%, from the year-ago quarter.

The provision for credit losses increased $24 million year-over-year to $103 million. NCOs increased $39 million year-over-year to $112 million. The increase in commercial NCOs was related to the loss incurred on loan sales from one retail mall REIT relationship, while the decrease in consumer NCOs reflected continued strong performance in those portfolios. NCOs represented an annualized 0.55% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, relatively unchanged from the prior quarter and up from 0.39% in the year-ago quarter. We remain confident in the long-term performance of our credit portfolios.

The allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) increased by $1.0 billion from the year ago quarter, increasing as a percentage of total loans and leases to 2.22% compared to 1.04% a year ago. The ALLL as a percentage of period-end total NALs increased to 341% from 167% over the same period. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) increased by $1.0 billion from the year-ago quarter to $1.9 billion, or 2.29% of total loans and leases. On a linked quarter basis, the ACL decreased $12 million. We believe the levels of the ALLL and ACL are appropriate given the current level of problem loans and the economic outlook.

Capital

Table 8 – Capital Ratios – Managing Capital Ratios within Targeted Ranges

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)December 31, 2020 figures are estimated. Amounts are presented on a Basel III standardized approach basis for calculating risk-weighted assets. The 2020 capital ratios reflect Huntington’s election of a five-year transition to delay for two years the full impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period.

See Pages 16-17 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.16% at December 31, 2020, down 72 basis points from a year ago. The regulatory Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio was 10.00% at December 31, 2020, compared to 9.88% at December 31, 2019. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.47% compared to 11.26% at December 31, 2019. The balance sheet growth impact on regulatory capital ratios was largely offset by a change in asset mix during 2020 related to the PPP loans and elevated deposits at the Federal Reserve (both of which are 0% risk weighted). The capital impact of earnings, adjusted for CECL transition, was largely offset by the repurchase of $92 million of common stock over the last four quarters (including $5 million repurchased during the 2020 fourth quarter to offset compensation plan-related share issuances) and cash dividends. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk‐based capital ratios also reflect the issuance of $500 million of Series F preferred stock in the 2020 second quarter and $500 million of Series G preferred stock in the 2020 third quarter.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $59 million in the 2020 fourth quarter compared to $55 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. The effective tax rates for the 2020 fourth quarter and 2019 fourth quarter were 15.8% and 14.8%, respectively.

At December 31, 2020, the Company had a net federal deferred tax liability of $158 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $24 million.

10

Expectations – Full Year 2021 (Huntington standalone)

Full-year revenue is expected to increase approximately 1% to 3%. Full-year noninterest expense is expected to increase approximately 3% to 5%. 

Average loans and leases are expected to increase approximately 2% to 4% on an annual basis. Average total deposits are expected to increase approximately 5% to 7% on an annual basis.

Asset quality metrics are expected to remain strong, with net charge-offs around the middle of the average through-the-cycle target range of approximately 35 to 55 basis points, with some moderate quarterly volatility.

The effective tax rate for full year 2021 is expected to be in the range of 16% to 17%.

Annualized Data

Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an “annualized” basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.

Fully-Taxable Equivalent Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.

Earnings per Share Equivalent Data

Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of our financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying an effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.

Rounding

Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.
