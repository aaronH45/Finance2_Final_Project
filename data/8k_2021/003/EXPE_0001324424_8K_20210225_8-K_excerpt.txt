On February 25, 2021, Expedia Group, Inc.

Compensation

Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Kern will receive an annualized base salary of $1,000,000. In addition, Mr. Kern will receive a one-time payment of $728,000, representing base salary from April 22, 2020, his first day as sole Chief Executive Officer of the Company, through February 25, 2021, during which time Mr. Kern did not receive any base salary. The one-time payment reflects a 25% reduction from May 1, 2020 until October 31, 2020, that the Company instituted in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

•the Company will continue to pay his base salary through the longer of (i) the completion of the Term, subject to a maximum of 36 months and (ii) twelve months; provided that such payments will be offset by any amount earned by Mr. Kern from another employer during such time period;

•except as described below with respect to the equity grants made on February 25, 2021 described below (the “New Equity Awards”), which have special vesting terms, equity awards held by Mr. Kern that otherwise would have vested during the twelve-month period following termination of employment will accelerate; provided that any equity awards that vest less frequently than annually shall be treated as though such awards vested annually;

•except as described below with respect to the New Equity Awards, Mr. Kern will have eighteen months following the date of termination to exercise any vested stock options granted by the Company (including stock options accelerated pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement) or, if earlier, through the scheduled expiration date of the options; and

•the Company will pay Mr. Kern in a lump sum an amount equal to 12 months of monthly premiums of group health plan continuation coverage under COBRA at the level of coverage in which Mr. Kern participated.

Restrictive Covenants

Mr. Kern will be restricted from competing with the Company and from soliciting Company employees and business partners during the eighteen-month period following his termination of employment for any reason.

Equity Grants

In connection with Mr. Kern entering into the Employment Agreement, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) approved the following long-term equity awards to Mr. Kern:

•an option (“Option Award”) to purchase 2,275,000 shares of Company common stock (“Shares”), with a strike price of $157.18 and a seven-year term that cliff vests on June 1, 2024, subject to Mr. Kern’s continued employment with the Company through the vesting date;
