(2) Three months ended November 30, 2019, includes an adjustment to remove volume associated with the Ballast Point craft beer business “Ballast Point Divestiture” for the period September 1, 2019, through November 30, 2019.

(3) Three months ended November 30, 2019, includes $20.2 million of net sales and $3.2 million of gross profit less marketing that are no longer part of the beer segment results after the Ballast Point Divestiture.

HIGHLIGHTS

•Constellation’s Beer Business posted double-digit depletion growth of 12%, as inventory levels improve and strong performance in off-premise channels continues to more than offset the COVID-19 impact of the approximately 35% reduction in the on-premise channel.

•Modelo Especial achieved nearly 20% depletion growth and was the #1 Import share gainer in IRI channels.

•The Corona Brand Family grew nearly 12% in IRI channels driven by Corona Premier, delivering over 20% growth, Corona Extra, and Corona Hard Seltzer. 

•Corona Hard Seltzer continues to exceed expectations as velocity and distribution of nearly 70% ACV in IRI channels remain strong; hard seltzer innovation expected to launch in early fiscal 2022 with the introduction of Variety Pack #2.

•Pacifico posted growth of almost 35% in IRI channels, and was a top share gainer within the import segment.

•Operating margin increased 330 basis points to 42.6%, as benefits from favorable marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales and the Ballast Point Divestiture were partially offset by increased COGS.

(4) Three months ended November 30, 2019, includes an adjustment to remove volume associated with the Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business “Black Velvet Divestiture” for the period September 1, 2019, through October 31, 2019.

(5) Three months ended November 30, 2019, includes $13.4 million of net sales and $7.0 million of gross profit less marketing that are no longer part of the wine and spirits segment results after the Black Velvet Divestiture.

HIGHLIGHTS

•Marketplace performance for higher-end wine Power Brands outpaced the total higher-end wine category driven by double-digit growth for Kim Crawford, Meiomi, and The Prisoner Brand Family.

•Successful innovation initiatives are contributing to top-line growth with Power Brand introductions like The Prisoner cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay varietals, along with Meiomi cabernet sauvignon, which has become the largest ultra premium wine launch this year in IRI channels.

•Operating margin decreased 220 basis points to 24.0% as benefits from mix and price were more than offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption resulting from wildfires and increased marketing.

CANOPY GROWTH INVESTMENT

Constellation’s share of Canopy Growth’s equity earnings and related activities for third quarter of fiscal 2021 totaled a loss of $12.4 million on a reported basis and a loss of $43.0 million on a comparable basis.

Constellation has recognized a $834 million unrealized net gain in reported basis results since the initial Canopy investment in November 2017; a $770 million increase in the fair value of Canopy investments was recognized for third quarter of fiscal 2021.

In December 2020, Canopy announced its plans to close five Canadian production facilities as part of its efforts to streamline its operations and further improve margins. As such, Canopy expects to record an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately C$350 million to C$400 million in their third and fourth quarter fiscal 2021 results. Constellation expects to record its proportional share of the estimated pre-tax loss of approximately C$130 million to C$155 million in our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 and first quarter of fiscal 2022 results.

Comparable basis (“comparable”) are amounts which exclude items that affect comparability (“comparable adjustments”), as they are not reflective of core operations of the segments. The company’s measure of segment profitability excludes comparable adjustments, which is consistent with the measure used by management to evaluate results. The company discusses various non-GAAP measures in this news release. Financial statements, as well as supplemental schedules and tables reconciling non-GAAP measures, together with definitions of these measures and the reasons management uses these measures, are included in this news release.

The Projections should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results will in fact occur. The actual impact of COVID-19 and its associated operating environment may be materially different than management’s expectations. The pending Paul Masson Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions. There can be no assurance the Paul Masson Transaction will occur or will occur on the terms or timetable contemplated hereby. There also can be no assurance Constellation will receive any incremental contingent consideration payment or any specific amount of incremental contingent consideration payment associated with the Further Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction.

•accuracy of supply projections, including those relating to wine and spirits operating activities, beer operations expansion activities, product inventory levels, and glass sourcing;
