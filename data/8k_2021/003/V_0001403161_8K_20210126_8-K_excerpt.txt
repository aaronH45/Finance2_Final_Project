Amendment and Restatement of the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan 

At the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) of Visa Inc. (“the Company”) held on January 26, 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Amended Equity Plan”). The Amended Equity Plan was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) on October 20, 2020, subject to the approval of the Company’s stockholders, and became effective with such stockholder approval on January 26, 2021. 

As a result of such stockholder approval, the Amended Equity Plan was materially amended to extend its term from January 31, 2022 to January 26, 2031. The Amended Equity Plan was also modified to reduce the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the equity incentive plan from its inception by 38 million shares of Class A common stock, from 236 million shares to 198 million shares.

A more complete description of the terms of the Amended Equity Plan and the material amendments and modifications thereto can be found in Proposal No. 4 — Approval of the Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, as Amended and Restated (pages 96 through 110) in the Company’s definitive proxy statement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 3, 2020 (the “Proxy Statement”), which description is incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing descriptions and the description incorporated by reference from the Company’s Proxy Statement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Amended Equity Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.22 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

At the Annual Meeting, upon the recommendation of the Board, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments (the "Charter Amendment") to the Company’s Sixth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to enable the adoption of a special meeting right for Class A common stockholders. As a result, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment setting forth the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 26, 2021. The Certificate of Amendment became effective upon filing. Following the filing of the Certificate of Amendment, the Company filed the Seventh Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Restated Certificate") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 26, 2021. The Restated Certificate became effective upon filing. 

In addition, subject to stockholder approval of the Charter Amendment and the filing and effectiveness of the Certificate of Amendment setting forth the Charter Amendment, the Board approved amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), to specify the procedures for stockholder-requested special meetings (the "Bylaw Amendment").

The foregoing summaries of the Charter Amendment and the Bylaw Amendment do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Restated Certificate and the Bylaws, copies of which are attached as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
