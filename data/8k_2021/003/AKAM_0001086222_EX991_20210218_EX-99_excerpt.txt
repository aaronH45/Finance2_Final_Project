The Talent, Leadership & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) will resolve all questions arising in the administration, interpretation and application of this plan, and the Compensation Committee’s determination will be final and binding on all concerned. Where permitted by applicable law, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to modify, at its discretion and at any time, the terms of this plan, including, but not limited to, the performance objectives, targets, and payouts. 

Target bonus amount:$________

To the extent earned, your bonus will be paid to you in fully-vested shares of Akamai common stock issued under the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended. Any such payment shall be subject to applicable withholding requirements.

Performance Objectives/Targets

Your ____ annual incentive bonus is comprised of three components: (1) corporate financial performance during Fiscal Year ____ against a non-GAAP revenue target (50%) (the “Revenue Component”); (2) corporate financial performance during Fiscal Year ____ against a non-GAAP operating income target (50%) (the “Operating Income Component” and, together with the Revenue Component, the “Financial Components”); and (3) corporate performance against environmental, social and governance targets set forth in Schedule 2 (the “ESG Targets”). 

The method for calculating corporate financial performance used to determine the Financial Components is described in the attached Schedule 1. In the event of any question as to whether the components of the Financial Components have been satisfied, the Compensation Committee shall make such determination. The Compensation Committee also has the authority to make downward discretionary changes to the payout amount. The amounts payable to you under the Financial Components are as follows:

Revenue Component

Akamai Performance Against

Target from Schedule 11 Target Amount ($M) Amount Payable to You

90% of Target $____ _ 0% of Component 

100% of Target: $____ _ 100% of Component 

110% or greater of Target $_____ 200% of Component

The issuance of shares of Akamai common stock earned by you (less tax withholding) will be made to you promptly following the Compensation Committee’s written certification of the amount earned hereunder as described in the preceding paragraph. The number of shares issued upon achievement of your bonus will be calculated based on the closing sale price of the Akamai’s common stock on the date of such certification.
