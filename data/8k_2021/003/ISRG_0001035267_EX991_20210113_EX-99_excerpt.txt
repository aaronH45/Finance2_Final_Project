Preliminary Results

The Company expects fourth quarter 2020 revenue of approximately $1.33 billion, an increase of 4% compared with $1.28 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Preliminary fourth quarter 2020 instruments and accessories revenue increased by 11% to approximately $747 million, compared with $671 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume and stocking orders associated with the Company's launch of Extended Use Instruments.

Fourth quarter 2020 da Vinci procedures increased approximately 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. In 2020, approximately 1,243,000 surgical procedures were performed with da Vinci Surgical Systems, an increase of 1% compared with 1,229,000 surgical procedures performed with da Vinci Surgical Systems in 2019. The 2020 procedure results reflect significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Preliminary fourth quarter 2020 systems revenue decreased by 12% to approximately $367 million, compared with $416 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

During 2020, da Vinci procedure volumes and system placements were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as healthcare systems around the world diverted resources to respond to COVID-19. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business has, and continues to, differ by geography and region. In the U.S., for example, while da Vinci procedures have recovered a significant portion of the pre-COVID-19 levels, the resurgence of COVID-19 in some states has had, and will likely continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company’s procedure volumes. Due to the continued uncertainty around the scope and duration of the pandemic globally, we cannot, at this time, reliably estimate the future impact on our operations and financial results.

Commenting on the announcement, Intuitive CEO Gary Guthart said, “Our customers continued to choose our products in the fourth quarter during a difficult healthcare environment. As we enter 2021, we remain focused on supporting our customers and advancing our innovative ecosystem of solutions aimed at improving surgery.”

The Company is scheduled to report its fourth quarter 2020 results during a conference call on January 21, 2021, at which point the Company will discuss the 2020 financial results in more detail.
