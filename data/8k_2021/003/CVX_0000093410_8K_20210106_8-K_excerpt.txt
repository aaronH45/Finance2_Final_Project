Other Events.  

On January 6, 2021, Chevron Corporation (“Chevron”) and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (“CUSA”) announced that, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 4, 2021, the aggregate principal amount of the ten series of notes described in the table below (collectively, the “Noble Notes”) issued by Noble Energy, Inc. (“Noble Energy”) had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in connection with Chevron’s and CUSA’s previously announced offers to exchange (the “Exchange Offers”) all validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted Noble Notes of each such series for new notes to be issued by CUSA and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Chevron (collectively, the “CUSA Notes”), and the related solicitations of consents to certain proposed amendments to the corresponding indentures pursuant to which such Noble Notes were issued (the “Noble Indentures”). A registration statement on Form S-4 (File Nos. 333-251094 and 333-251094-01) (the “Registration Statement”) relating to the Exchange Offers and consent solicitations was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on December 3, 2020 (as amended by Pre-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement filed with the SEC on December 4, 2020) and declared effective on December 11, 2020.  

Pursuant to the Exchange Offers, the aggregate principal amount of Noble Notes set forth below were validly tendered and accepted and subsequently cancelled:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Following such cancellation, $102,733,000 aggregate principal amount of the Noble Notes remain outstanding across ten series of notes issued by Noble Energy.  

In connection with the Exchange Offers, Chevron and CUSA also solicited consents from holders of the Noble Notes to amend (the “Proposed Amendments”) the three indentures governing the Noble Notes (the “Noble Indentures”) to, among other things, eliminate certain reporting requirements, restrictive covenants and events of default in the Noble Indentures. On January 6, 2021, Noble Energy, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and The Bank of New York Mellon, N.A., as applicable, entered into supplemental indentures to each of the Noble Indentures that govern the terms of the Noble Notes to adopt the Proposed Amendments (the “Supplemental Indentures”). The Supplemental Indentures will govern the Noble Notes that remain outstanding after the settlement of the Exchange Offers.  

The foregoing summaries of the Supplemental Indentures do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete terms of the Supplemental Indentures, copies of which are filed as exhibits hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.  

The CUSA Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to the Registration Statement. The terms of the CUSA Notes are further described in the Prospectus dated December 11, 2020, as filed with the SEC under Rule 424(b)(3) of the Securities Act on that date. The issuance of the CUSA Notes occurred on January 6, 2021. The CUSA Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of CUSA and will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of CUSA issued from time to time. The obligations under the CUSA Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Chevron on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis and will rank equally to any other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Chevron that is currently outstanding or that Chevron may issue in the future.  

2   

The CUSA Notes are governed by the terms of an Indenture, dated August 12, 2020, as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated January 6, 2021, by and among CUSA, Chevron, as guarantor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee.
