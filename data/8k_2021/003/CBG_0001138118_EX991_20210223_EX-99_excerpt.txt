CBRE GROUP, INC. REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR Q4 AND FULL YEAR 2020

GAAP EPS of $0.93 for Q4 and $2.22 for 2020

Adjusted EPS of $1.45 for Q4 and $3.27 for 2020

Dallas, TX – February 23, 2021 — CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020.

“We ended 2020 on a high note with adjusted earnings per share for the quarter reaching an all-time high and adjusted EBITDA growing by 9%,” said Bob Sulentic, CBRE’s president and chief executive officer. “This capped a year of significant challenges stemming from Covid-19, but also one that brought to the forefront CBRE’s competitive advantages, our ability to capitalize on often-overlooked industry opportunities, and the resiliency we’ve built into the business over the past decade.” 

“Our broad diversification across four key dimensions – property types, lines of business, geographic markets and clients – has served us well compared with prior downturns,” he continued. “Now we are exiting the worst of the Covid-19 crisis in great shape, with a leaner operating structure, significant financial capacity and a strategy squarely aimed at the many opportunities unfolding in our industry, including those with secular tailwinds. We’ve built our long-term plan on the assumption that office demand remains under pressure. Nevertheless, we still expect to achieve a minimum of low double-digit average annual adjusted earnings per share growth from this year through at least 2025, absent a recession, with meaningful upside potential from additional capital allocation.”

Consolidated Financial Results Overview

The following table presents highlights of CBRE performance (dollars in millions, except per share data):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which continued to constrain sales and leasing activity. Additionally, GAAP net income and earnings per share reflect about $120 million of costs related to transformation initiatives, which reduced GAAP earnings per share by about $0.28 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA, which exclude these transitory costs, increased markedly from fourth-quarter 2019. 

Advisory Services Segment

The following table presents highlights of the Advisory Services segment performance (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In Advisory Services, the severe economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic continued to constrain higher-margin lease and sales revenue, leading to lower adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. 

Large office occupiers continued to defer leasing decisions, resulting in a 28% (29% local currency) decline in advisory leasing revenue. Fourth quarter activity was soft across most of the world, with U.S. leasing revenue down 36%. Industrial leasing revenue, fueled by e-commerce, rose 20% globally and 24% in the Americas. Robust growth in industrial leasing limited the U.K.’s overall leasing revenue decline to 6% (8% local currency) in the quarter.

Capital flows into commercial real estate improved from earlier in the year, but global market activity remained well below 2019 levels. Global property sales revenue declined 15% (16% local currency). However, the U.S. performed much better with sales revenue down only 5%, driven by strong industrial and multifamily activity and an overall market share gain of 90 basis points for the quarter, according to Real Capital Analytics. In North Asia, sales revenue was flat (down 5% local currency) as strength in China offset weakness elsewhere.

By contrast, commercial mortgage originations were robust, reflecting a surge in government agency lending. Commercial mortgage revenue rose 49% (same local currency) from fourth-quarter 2019. Refinancing continued to drive lending activity and loan sales increased sharply. The recent rise in Treasury yields has been partially offset by tighter spreads as more lenders compete to place capital. 

Revenue from loan servicing, which is performed for lenders on a contractual basis, jumped 25% (24% local currency) for the quarter. The loan servicing portfolio ended 2020 at approximately $269 billion, up 17% for the year.

Valuation also performed well with revenue up 4% (2% local currency), reflecting increased assignments from investor clients, particularly in Continental Europe, North Asia and Pacific. Property management and advisory project management services fee revenue fell 4% (6% local currency). 

Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) Segment

The following table presents highlights of the GWS segment performance (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Despite the ongoing challenges from Covid-19, CBRE’s GWS segment achieved robust global adjusted EBITDA growth, driven by strong gains in Continental Europe and North Asia as well as cost-control actions.

Solid fee revenue growth was constrained by sharply lower transaction activity for GWS occupier clients. Facilities management, which accounted for 84% of the segment’s fee revenue and is largely contractual, rose 7% (5% local currency). Facilities management growth was especially strong in Continental Europe. Project management fee revenue also rose notably, up 7% (5% local currency), with strong growth in Continental Europe, North Asia and India/Southeast Asia/Middle East/Africa. 

The segment’s overall margin expansion of approximately 350 basis points reflected the benefit of lower discretionary spending and structural changes to the cost base.

Real Estate Investments (REI) Segment

The following table presents highlights of the REI segment performance (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The sharp increase in this segment’s adjusted EBITDA was driven by robust performance from both investment management and U.S. development activity.

Investment management revenue rose 34% (30% local currency) to $150.2 million, reflecting strong carried interest revenue contributions and higher asset management, incentive and acquisition fees. Carried interest of $31.5 million – compared with $9.7 million in fourth-quarter 2019 – included strong gains on the disposition of a retail property portfolio in South Korea. Adjusted EBITDA surged 228% (217% local currency), as asset management growth and strong investment gains, including co-investment returns, were complemented by prudent cost management.

Assets under management at year-end 2020 totaled $122.7 billion, a record high for the company and an increase of $8.2 billion ($4.9 billion local currency) from third-quarter 2020. The increase reflected higher asset valuations, net capital inflows and favorable foreign currency movement.

U.S. real estate development contributed $58.3 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, more than double the $24.0 million achieved in the year-earlier fourth quarter. These results benefited from elevated industrial asset sales during the quarter. The U.K. multifamily development business (Telford Homes) produced $9.2 million of adjusted EBITDA, down from $10.9 million in fourth-quarter 2019. 

The in-process development portfolio ended 2020 at $14.9 billion, up $0.1 billion from third-quarter 2020 – a record level for the company. Three asset types that remain in strong demand, multifamily, industrial and health care, plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased, comprise more than 80% of this portfolio. In addition, more than half of the in-process portfolio is attributable to fee-development and built-to-suit projects. The pipeline increased by $0.2 billion from third-quarter 2020 to $6.1 billion. 

Investment in the startup of the company’s flexible workspace business, Hana, contributed a loss of $10.4 million, up from a loss of $8.4 million in fourth-quarter 2019. Hana operates 10 existing units in the U.S. and U.K., totaling nearly 500,000 sq. ft.

On February 22, 2021, CBRE announced the acquisition of a 35% interest in Industrious, a leading provider of premium flexible workplace solutions in the U.S., with the expectation to increase its total stake to 40% in the coming weeks. Under the agreement, Hana will be combined with Industrious in the second quarter.

Adjustments to GAAP Net Income and Earnings Per Share

Adjustments to GAAP net income totaled $177.0 million on a net basis. This included approximately $223.8 million of positive pre-tax adjustments, including $120.5 million of costs associated with transformation initiatives; $75.6 million of write-offs of financing costs on extinguished debt; $18.7 million of non-cash acquisition-related depreciation and amortization; $13.5 million of asset impairments; $11.4 million of investment management carried interest incentive compensation reversal to align with the timing of associated carried interest revenue; $4.4 million of costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring; $2.3 million of fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the Telford Homes acquisition that were sold in the fourth quarter; $0.2 million of integration and other costs related to acquisitions; and a $46.8 million net tax adjustment associated with the aforementioned pre-tax adjustments.

GAAP net income decreased 51% (52% local currency) to $314 million and earnings per share decreased 51% (same local currency) to $0.93 per diluted share, compared with the prior-year period. Adjusted net income increased 9% (8% local currency) to $491 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 10% (8% local currency) to $1.45 per diluted share, compared with the prior-year period. The decrease in GAAP earnings per share largely reflected costs associated with transformation initiatives, which have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. Certain of these costs were being contemplated prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and reflect the outcome of an in-depth strategic review. These initiatives are expected to drive significant cost structure benefits going forward. 

Capital Allocation Overview

•Free Cash Flow – During the fourth quarter of 2020, free cash flow decreased 9% to approximately $864 million. This reflected cash flow from operating activities of $940 million, less total capital expenditures of $76 million. Net capital expenditures (of which a considerable portion during the period was discretionary) totaled $56.6 million.(9)

•Stock Repurchase Program – The company did not repurchase any of its stock during the fourth quarter of 2020, and has $350 million of capacity remaining under its repurchase program.

•Acquisitions – During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company acquired a provider of facilities and technical maintenance services in Australia.

Leverage and Financing Overview

•Leverage – The company’s net leverage ratio (net cash(10) to full year adjusted EBITDA) was (0.21x) as of December 31, 2020, which is substantially below the company’s primary debt covenant of 4.25x. The net leverage ratio is computed as follows (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Liquidity – As of December 31, 2020, the company had approximately $4.6 billion of total liquidity, consisting of approximately $1.8 billion in cash(11) plus the ability to borrow an aggregate of approximately $2.8 billion under its revolving credit facilities, net of any outstanding letters of credit.

The terms “fee revenue,” “adjusted revenue,” “adjusted net income,” “adjusted earnings per share” (or adjusted EPS), “adjusted EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA on revenue margin,” “adjusted EBITDA on fee revenue margin,” “free cash flow” and “net cash” all of which CBRE uses in this press release, are non-GAAP financial measures under SEC guidelines, and you should refer to the footnotes below as well as the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section in this press release for a further explanation of these measures. We have also included in that section reconciliations of these measures in specific periods to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for those periods.

Totals may not sum in tables in millions included in this release due to rounding.

Note – CBRE has not reconciled the (non-GAAP) adjusted earnings per share forward-looking guidance included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to costs related to acquisitions, carried interest incentive compensation and financing costs, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

(1)Local currency percentage change is calculated by comparing current-period results at prior-period exchange rates versus prior-period results.

(2)Fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients.

(3)EBITDA represents earnings before depreciation and amortization, asset impairments, interest expense, net of interest income, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, and provision for income taxes. Amounts shown for adjusted EBITDA further remove (from EBITDA) the impact of costs associated with transformation initiatives, costs associated with workforce optimization efforts, fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the Telford Acquisition (purchase accounting) that were sold in the period, costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring, integration and other costs related to acquisitions, carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, and costs associated with our 2019 segment reorganization, including cost-savings initiatives.

(4)Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share (or adjusted EPS) exclude the effect of select items from GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per diluted share as well as adjust the provision for income taxes for such charges. Adjustments during the periods presented included costs associated with transformation initiatives, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets attributable to acquisitions, certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, the impact of fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the Telford Acquisition (purchase accounting) that were sold in the period, costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring, integration and other costs related to acquisitions, asset impairments, costs primarily associated with our workforce optimization efforts in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, costs associated with our 2019 segment reorganization, including cost-savings initiatives, and write-off of financing costs on extinguished of debt.

(5)Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures (reflected in the investing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows).

(6)Adjusted EBITDA on revenue and fee revenue margins represents adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue and fee revenue, respectively.

(7)Adjusted revenue for the Real Estate Investments segment reflects revenue for this segment, less the direct cost of revenue, along with equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate, net of non-controlling interests. Adjusted revenue also removes the impact of fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the Telford acquisition (purchase accounting) that were sold in the period.

(8)Adjusted EBITDA in the Real Estate Investments segment includes equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate, net of non-controlling interests, and the associated compensation expense.

(9)For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the company incurred capital expenditures of $76.0 million (reflected in the investing section of the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows) and received tenant concessions from landlords of $19.4 million (reflected in the operating section of the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows).

(10)Net cash is calculated as cash available for company use less total debt (excluding non-recourse debt).

(11)Cash represents cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and excludes $102.9 million of cash in consolidated funds and other entities not available for company use at December 31, 2020.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following measures are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC guidelines:

(i)Fee revenue

(ii)Adjusted revenue for the Real Estate Investments segment

(iii)Net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders, as adjusted (which we also refer to as “adjusted net income”)

(iv)Diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders, as adjusted (which we also refer to as “adjusted earnings per diluted share” or “adjusted EPS”)

(v)Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on revenue and fee revenue margins

(vi)Free cash flow

(vii)Net cash

These measures are not recognized measurements under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Our management generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. The company believes these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. The company further uses certain of these measures, and believes that they are useful to investors, for purposes described below.

With respect to fee revenue: the company believes that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the financial performance of our Global Workplace Solutions and Property and Advisory Project Management business lines and our business in general. Fee revenue excludes costs reimbursable by clients, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business.

With respect to adjusted revenue: the company believes that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the financial performance of our Real Estate Investments segment because it is more reflective of this segment’s total operations.

With respect to adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on revenue and fee revenue margins: the company believes that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the accounting effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions—and in the case of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on revenue and fee revenue margins—the effects of financings and income tax and the accounting effects of capital spending. All of these measures and adjusted revenue may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In the case of adjusted EBITDA, this measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use because it does not consider cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The adjusted EBITDA measure calculated herein may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt. The company also uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS as significant components when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.

With respect to free cash flow, the company believes that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the cash flow generated from operations after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and capital expenditures. With respect to net cash, the company believes that investors use this measure when calculating the company’s net leverage ratio.
