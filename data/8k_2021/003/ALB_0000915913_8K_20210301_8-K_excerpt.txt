Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

On March 1, 2021, Albemarle Corporation (the “Company” or “Albemarle”) issued a press release announcing the commencement of two cash tender offers (collectively, the “Tender Offers”) by the Company and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Albemarle Wodgina Pty Ltd (“Wodgina”) and Albemarle New Holding GmbH (“New Holding”). The first tender offer is for up to $100 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 4.150% Senior Notes due 2024 and Wodgina’s 3.45% Senior Notes due 2029. The second tender offer is for up to €100 million aggregate principal amount of New Holding’s 1.125% Notes due 2025 and 1.625% Notes due 2028. The Tender Offers are being made exclusively pursuant to an offer to purchase dated March 1, 2021, which sets forth the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers.

Concurrent with the Tender Offers, the Company intends to redeem (the “Note Redemption”) all of its outstanding 1.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) and all of its outstanding Floating Rate Notes due 2022 (the “Floating Rate Notes”). The 2021 Notes, with an outstanding aggregate principal amount of €392,933,000, are expected to be redeemed on March 30, 2021 and the Floating Rate Notes, with an outstanding aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 are expected to be redeemed on March 16, 2021. This Current Report on Form 8-K is not a notice of redemption.
