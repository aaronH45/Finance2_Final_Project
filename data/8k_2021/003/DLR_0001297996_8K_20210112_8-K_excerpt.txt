Introductory Note  

Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” “the company” or “Digital Realty” refer to Digital Realty Trust, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Digital Realty Trust, L.P., our “operating partnership.”  

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On January 12, 2021, Digital Intrepid Holding B.V., an indirect wholly owned holding and finance subsidiary of the operating partnership through which the Interxion business is held, issued and sold €1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.625% Guaranteed Notes due 2031 (the “Euro Notes”). The Euro Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and the operating partnership. The Euro Notes were sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Euro Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to United States persons (within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act) absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.  

The terms of the Euro Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of January 12, 2021, among Digital Intrepid Holding B.V., Digital Realty Trust, Inc., the operating partnership, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent and a transfer agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as registrar and a transfer agent (the “Indenture”), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The Indenture contains various restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requirements to maintain a pool of unencumbered assets. The descriptions of the Indenture, the Euro Notes and the guarantees in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture, including the form of the Euro Notes included therein.  

Net proceeds from the offering of the Euro Notes were approximately €988.3 million after deducting managers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses. We intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Euro Notes to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, recently completed or future green building, energy and resource efficiency and renewable energy projects, including the development and redevelopment of such projects (collectively, “Eligible Green Projects”). Pending the allocation of the net proceeds of the Euro Notes to Eligible Green Projects, all or a portion of an amount equal to the net proceeds from the Euro Notes may be used to temporarily repay borrowings outstanding under the operating partnership’s global revolving credit facilities, acquire additional properties or businesses, fund development opportunities, invest in interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing securities which are consistent with Digital Realty Trust, Inc.’s intention to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and to provide for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including potentially for the repayment of other debt, or the redemption, repurchase, repayment or retirement of outstanding equity or debt securities, or a combination of the foregoing.  

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.  

On January 12, 2021, Digital Intrepid Holding B.V., an indirect wholly owned holding and finance subsidiary of the operating partnership through which the Interxion business is held, issued and sold €1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes. The purchase price paid by the initial purchasers for the Euro Notes was 99.065% of the principal amount thereof. The Euro Notes bear interest at the rate of 0.625% per annum and will mature on July 15, 2031. Interest on the Euro Notes is payable on July 15 of each year beginning on July 15, 2021. The Euro Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. and rank equally in right of payment with all of Digital Intrepid Holding B.V.’s other existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Digital Intrepid Holding B.V.’s obligations under the Euro Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and the operating partnership.    

The Euro Notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at Digital Intrepid Holding B.V.’s option, at a redemption price equal to the sum of:  

   •    

an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Euro Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date; and     

   •    

a make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.     

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of the Euro Notes are redeemed on or after 90 days prior to the maturity date, the redemption price will not include a make-whole premium.  

All payments of principal and interest on the Euro Notes will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by the United States or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein having power to tax, unless the withholding of such tax, assessment or governmental charge is required by law or the official interpretation or administration thereof. In the event such withholding or deduction of taxes is required by law, then, subject to certain exceptions, Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. will pay such “additional amounts” necessary so that the net payment of the principal of and interest on the Euro Notes to a holder who is not a United States person for United States federal income tax purposes, including additional amounts, after the withholding or deduction, will not be less than the amount provided in such Euro Notes to be then due and payable.  

If, due to certain changes in tax law, Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. has or will become obligated to pay additional amounts on the Euro Notes or if there is a substantial probability that Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. will become obligated to pay additional amounts on the Euro Notes, then Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. may, on giving not less than 15 days’ nor more than 45 days’ notice, at its option, redeem the Euro Notes, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Euro Notes to be redeemed, together with interest accrued and unpaid to the date fixed for redemption.  

Certain events are considered events of default, which may result in the accelerated maturity of the Euro Notes, including:  

   •    

a default for 30 days in payment of any installment of interest under the Euro Notes;     

   •    

a default in the payment of the principal amount or redemption price due with respect to the Euro Notes, when the same becomes due and payable;     

   •    

Digital Intrepid Holding B.V.’s, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.’s, or the operating partnership’s failure to comply with any of their respective other agreements in the Euro Notes or the Indenture upon receipt by Digital Intrepid Holding B.V., Digital Realty Trust, Inc., or the operating partnership of notice of such default from the trustee or from holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes then outstanding and Digital Intrepid Holding B.V.’s, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.’s, or the operating partnership’s failure to cure (or obtain a waiver of) such default within 90 days after receipt of such notice;     

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   •    

certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, or court appointment of a receiver, liquidator or trustee of Digital Intrepid Holding B.V., Digital Realty Trust, Inc., the operating partnership or any Significant Subsidiary or any substantial part of their respective property.
