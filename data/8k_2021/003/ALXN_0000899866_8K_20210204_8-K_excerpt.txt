On February 4, 2021, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. issued a press release relating to its results of operations and financial condition for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2020. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.

The attached press release contains both U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the following GAAP items: share-based compensation expense, fair value adjustment of inventory acquired, amortization of purchased intangible assets, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, restructuring and related expenses, upfront payments related to licenses and other strategic agreements, acquired in-process research and development, impairment of purchased intangible assets, gains and losses related to strategic equity investments, litigation charges, gain or loss on sale of a business or asset, gain or loss related to modification of purchase options, contingent milestone payments associated with acquisitions of legal entities accounted for as asset acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and certain adjustments to income tax expense. Reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures are included in the press release set forth as Exhibit 99.1 furnished in this Form 8-K. Alexion's management utilizes non-GAAP financial information to provide a useful measure of comparative operating performance of Alexion.

The press release, and the information set forth therein, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.
