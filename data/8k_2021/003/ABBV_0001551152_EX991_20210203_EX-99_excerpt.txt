Recent Events

•AbbVie announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Rinvoq (upadacitinib, 15 mg, once daily) for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Rinvoq is the first oral, once-daily, selective and reversible JAK inhibitor approved for three adult rheumatic indications in the European Union: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), PsA and AS. The EC approval is supported by data from three pivotal clinical studies in PsA and AS where Rinvoq met all primary and key secondary endpoints with a safety profile consistent with that seen in RA.

•AbbVie announced top-line results from the Phase 3b Heads Up study showing that Rinvoq (30 mg, once daily) achieved superiority to Dupixent (dupilumab, 300 mg, every other week) for the primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with at least a 75 percent improvement in the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI 75) at week 16, in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Rinvoq also showed superiority versus Dupixent for all ranked secondary endpoints, including early improvements in itch and skin clearance. The safety profile of Rinvoq was consistent with previous AD studies, with no new safety risks observed. Full results from the Heads Up study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

•AbbVie announced positive results from the Phase 3 induction study, U-ACHIEVE, which showed Rinvoq (45 mg, once daily) met the primary endpoint of clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo Score) at week 8 in adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Additionally, all ranked secondary endpoints, including clinical, endoscopic and histologic outcomes, were met. The safety results in this study were consistent with the known profile of Rinvoq, with no new safety risks observed. U-ACHIEVE is the first of two Phase 3 induction studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Rinvoq in adults with moderate to severe UC and full results from the study will be presented at a future medical meeting and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

•AbbVie announced positive top-line results from the Phase 3 ADVANCE and MOTIVATE studies, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Skyrizi (risankizumab) for induction therapy in adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD). In ADVANCE and MOTIVATE, both doses of Skyrizi (600mg and 1200mg) met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response at week 12, demonstrating superiority versus placebo. Additionally, key secondary endpoints showed significant clinical and endoscopic outcomes, with symptom improvement observed as early as week 4. The overall safety results in these studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Skyrizi, with no new safety risks observed. Skyrizi is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally.

•AbbVie announced positive top-line results from the Phase 3 KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2 studies evaluating Skyrizi (150 mg) in adults with active PsA, with Skyrizi demonstrating strong levels of response on both joint and skin endpoints. In both Phase 3 trials, significantly more patients treated with Skyrizi achieved the primary endpoint of ACR20 response at week 24 versus placebo. Results of ranked secondary endpoints showed significant improvements in skin clearance (as measured by at least a 90 percent improvement in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 90)), physical function (as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)) and minimal disease activity (MDA) at week 24. The safety results in these studies to-date were generally consistent with the known profile of Skyrizi in psoriasis (PsO) patients. Detailed data from both pivotal studies will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and we expect to submit our regulatory applications for Skyrizi in PsA in the first half of this year. 

•AbbVie hosted an Immunology Strategic Update event on December 14, 2020 for members of the investment community. The event highlighted AbbVie’s immunology leadership, market expectations, strong and growing body of clinical data, innovative pipeline, and strategy to capitalize on a best-in-class immunology portfolio over the long term. As part of the event, AbbVie raised its 2025 risk-adjusted combined sales guidance for Skyrizi and Rinvoq to greater than $15 billion, above previous guidance of greater than $10 billion. Supporting materials from the Immunology Strategic Update, including the event presentation and an archived webcast, can be found on AbbVie's Investor Relations website at investors.abbvie.com.

Recent Events (continued)

•At the virtual American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition (ASH), AbbVie presented data from nearly 40 abstracts on 8 investigational and approved products across 11 cancer types, including 10 oral presentations. Key data presentations included new disease-free survival data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE study evaluating Imbruvica (ibrutinib) plus Venclexta (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL); new extended follow-up data for fixed duration treatment Venclexta in CLL from the Phase 3 Murano and Phase 3 CLL14 studies; results from several long-term follow-up studies evaluating Imbruvica in multiple types of blood cancers; and data from collaborations on pipeline candidates in partnership with Genmab and I-Mab. Venetoclax is being developed by AbbVie and Roche and is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. Imbruvica is jointly developed and commercialized with Janssen Biotech, Inc.

•AbbVie announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the update of the Imbruvica Prescribing Information to include efficacy and safety data for the combination of Imbruvica with rituximab for the treatment of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM). The update is based on more than 5 years of Phase 3 iNNOVATE final analysis data, which demonstrated Imbruvica plus rituximab significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus rituximab alone in adults with WM. Imbruvica was approved as a monotherapy for WM in 2015 and as a combination therapy with rituximab in 2018 based on the iNNOVATE primary analysis. 

•Allergan Aesthetics announced the launch of CoolSculpting Elite, its next generation fat reduction system with new technology that allows for the treatment of two areas of fat at once and new elite applicators designed for improved fit and comfort. CoolSculpting Elite harnesses proven CoolSculpting technology to target, freeze, and eliminate treated fat cells. CoolSculpting Elite is FDA cleared to treat visible fat bulges in nine areas of the body including the thigh, abdomen, and flank, along with bra fat, back fat, underneath the buttocks (also known as banana roll), upper arm, and the submental and submandibular areas.

•Allergan Aesthetics entered into a warrant agreement with Cypris Medical, a privately held medical device company, that provides Allergan Aesthetics the right to acquire Cypris Medical, including the company's Xact device, following the completion of a clinical trial to be initiated in 2021. The Xact device is a minimally-invasive alternative option for performing face and neck lifts and the planned clinical trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Xact in treating midface descent as well as for neck lifts.

•AbbVie presented results from 16 neurotoxin research abstracts across multiple therapeutic and cosmetic indications at the TOXINS 2021 Virtual Conference. The presentations included new analyses from the CD-PROBE study evaluating sustained efficacy and tolerability of Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) in patients with cervical dystonia, new analyses from the ASPIRE study on patient adherence to Botox for management of spasticity, data on Botox treatment in adult patients with overactive bladder and in pediatric patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity, a meta-analysis of immunogenicity rates across 10 therapeutic and aesthetic indications and results from a clinical trial evaluating the safety and pharmacodynamic response with higher doses of Botox on clinician and patient reported outcomes in patients with moderate to severe glabellar lines.

•At the virtual American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2020, AbbVie presented new Phase 2 efficacy data for an investigational treatment of presbyopia, new data evaluating the effectiveness of Durysta (bimatoprost implant) and additional analysis of data from Phase 3 ARTEMIS studies that shed light on how glaucoma patients with different characteristics may respond to Durysta.
