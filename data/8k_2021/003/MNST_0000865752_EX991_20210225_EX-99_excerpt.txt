Corona, CA – February 25, 2021 – Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ: MNST) today reported financial results for the three- and twelve-months ended December 31, 2020. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

The Company’s top priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Early in March 2020, the Company implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. Throughout this period, the Company has engaged with its employees through on-going communications, on-line training and personal development opportunities to promote their well-being and motivation. The Company’s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities, are all operating. Certain of the Company’s bottlers/distributors have implemented modifications to their call points and service levels, but the Company’s products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries the operations of its bottlers/distributors have been more affected. 

Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company achieved record fourth quarter net sales. While the Company’s performance in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) was solid in the fourth quarter, EMEA remained adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since mid-March 2020, the

Company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in food service on-premise consumption. The Company’s sales in the 2020 second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel (which is the Company’s largest channel) but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter and throughout the 2020 third and fourth quarters. The Company’s e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business continued to increase in the fourth quarter, while its food service on-premise business, which is a small channel for the Company, remained challenged. 

Currently, the Company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers/distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Company is not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages, and its supply chain remains intact. The Company is continually addressing the increase in its aluminum can requirements given the Company’s volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. 

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $1.18 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $881.4 million in short-term investments and $44.3 million in long-term investments. Based on currently available information, the Company does not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on its liquidity. 

Fourth Quarter Results 

Net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter increased 17.6 percent to $1.20 billion, from $1.02 billion in the same period last year. Net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to product returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and a labeling issue concerning one product in Japan (the “Product Returns”). Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter of $7.1 million. 

Net sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which primarily includes the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks and Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, increased 17.7 percent to $1.12 billion for the 2020 fourth quarter, from $953.2 million for the 2019 fourth quarter. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $15.2 million related to the Product Returns. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $5.8 million for the 2020 fourth quarter. 

Net sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which primarily includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands, increased 14.8 percent to $67.9 million for the 2020 fourth quarter, from $59.2 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Strategic Brands segment of $1.3 million for the 2020 fourth quarter. 

Net sales for the Company’s Other segment, which includes certain products of American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, sold to independent third party customers (the “AFF Third-Party Products”), increased to $6.7 million for the 2020 fourth quarter, from $4.9 million in the 2019 fourth quarter.

Net sales to customers outside the United States increased 20.4 percent to $384.8 million in the 2020 fourth quarter, from $319.5 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. Such sales were approximately 32 percent of total net sales in the 2020 fourth quarter, compared with 31 percent in the 2019 fourth quarter. Net sales to customers outside the United States for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million primarily related to the Product Returns. 

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, for the 2020 fourth quarter was 57.7 percent, compared with 60.0 percent in the 2019 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was primarily the result of the impact of the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (excluding the impact of the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs), was 59.3 percent for the 2020 fourth quarter. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of increased input costs and unfavorable geographical mix during the 2020 fourth quarter, which was partially offset by favorable product mix. 

Operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were $288.4 million, compared with $293.7 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were 24.1 percent, compared with 28.9 percent in the 2019 fourth quarter. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to (i) decreased expenditures of $13.5 million for legal settlements and (ii) decreased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements as well as travel and entertainment, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The costs for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been, or may be, deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. 

Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.9 percent for the 2020 fourth quarter, compared with 3.5 percent in the 2019 fourth quarter. 

Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were 9.8 percent, compared with 12.3 percent in the 2019 fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the reduction in sponsorship and endorsement costs referred to above. 

General and administrative expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were $123.8 million, or 10.4 percent of net sales, compared with $133.0 million, or 13.1 percent of net sales, for the 2019 fourth quarter. Stock-based compensation was $17.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $16.4 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. 

Operating income for the 2020 fourth quarter increased to $402.3 million, from $317.0 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. Operating income for the 2020 fourth quarter (excluding the impact of the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs) increased to $429.6 million. 

The effective tax rate for the 2020 fourth quarter was -17.7 percent, compared with 20.6 percent in the 2019 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million, due to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets between certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in a step-up of the tax-deductible basis in the transferred assets in a foreign jurisdiction, and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and the book basis for

such intangible assets (the “Non-Recurring Tax Benefit”). The effective tax rate for the 2020 fourth quarter (excluding the Non-Recurring Tax Benefit) was 23.5 percent. 

Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter increased 85.0 percent to $471.7 million, from $255.0 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. Net income per diluted share for the 2020 fourth quarter increased 87.5 percent to $0.88, from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter (excluding the Non-Recurring Tax Benefit, the impact of the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs) increased 28.9 percent to $328.6 million, from $255.0 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. Net income per diluted share for the 2020 fourth quarter (excluding the Non-Recurring Tax Benefit, the impact of the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs) increased 30.6 percent to $0.62 from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said: “The Company posted record fourth quarter net sales and profits, despite the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in most of our markets. With ongoing lockdowns and restrictions, EMEA remains adversely affected, but continued to deliver solid results. 

“The procurement of aluminum cans in excess of our contracted volumes, remains challenging. However, our supply chain remains intact and we are continuing to service our customers. 

“According to Nielsen, the energy drink category, as well as our Monster Energy® brand, continues to grow in most of our markets, including the United States,” Sacks added. 

 Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Hilton H. Schlosberg said: “We continued to launch a number of energy drinks under certain of our brand families including Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, and Predator® energy drinks (one of our affordable energy brands), in our domestic and international markets in the 2020 fourth quarter as well in the first two months of 2021. 

“In particular, we are pleased with the early results of our Monster Energy Ultra® Watermelon, Juice Monster® Khaotic® and Juice Monster® PapillonTM energy drinks that were launched in early October 2020 in the United States,” Schlosberg said. 

2020 Full Year Results 

Net sales for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 increased 9.5 percent to $4.60 billion, from $4.20 billion in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the twelve-months were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the Product Returns. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 of $48.2 million. 

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020, was 59.2 percent, compared with 60.0 percent in the comparable period last year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (excluding the impact of the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs) was 59.6 percent for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 as compared with 60.0 percent in the comparable period last year. 

Operating expenses for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 were $1.09 billion, compared with $1.12 billion in the comparable period last year. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreased expenditures for sponsorship and endorsements and decreased expenditures for travel and

entertainment, each largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as decreased expenditures related to the costs associated with distributor terminations. The costs for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been, or may be, deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to estimate in what future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. Operating expenses for comparable twelve-months ended December 31, 2019 included a $15.5 million provision for legal settlements. 

Operating income for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 increased to $1.63 billion, from $1.40 billion in the comparable period last year. Operating income for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 (excluding the impact of the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs) increased to $1.66 billion, from $1.40 billion in the comparable period last year. 

The effective tax rate for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 was 13.3 percent, compared with 21.8 percent in the comparable period last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the Non-Recurring Tax Benefit. The effective tax rate for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 (excluding the Non-Recurring Tax Benefit) was 23.5 percent. 

Net income for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 increased 27.2 percent to $1.41 billion, from $1.11 billion in the comparable period last year. Net income per diluted share for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 increased 30.0 percent to $2.64, from $2.03 in the comparable period last year. Net income for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 (excluding the Non-Recurring Tax Benefit, the impact of the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs) increased 14.3 percent to $1.27 billion, from $1.11 billion in the comparable period last year. Net income per diluted share for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 (excluding the Non-Recurring Tax Benefit, the impact of the Product Returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs) increased 16.8 percent to $2.37, from $2.03 in the comparable period last year.
