UNITEDHEALTH GROUP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2020 RESULTS

•Full Year Revenues of $257.1 Billion Grew $15.0 Billion or 6%, led by 21% at Optum

•Full Year and Fourth Quarter Net Earnings Per Share of $16.03 and $2.30

•Full Year and Fourth Quarter Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share of $16.88 and $2.52

•Results Reflect COVID-19 Impacts and Related Assistance Initiatives

MINNETONKA, Minn. (January 20, 2021) – Fundamental execution was strong across UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) in the fourth quarter and throughout the full year 2020, led by Optum and by UnitedHealthcare’s community and senior benefit businesses, even as the Company delivered expansive voluntary relief efforts for consumers, care providers and customers across the health system. 

“I couldn’t be prouder of the more than 325,000 women and men of this enterprise for their role in advancing a higher performing health system during these times of unprecedented challenges” said David S. Wichmann, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group. “We are grateful for the human spirit and resolve of our people, including our 125,000 clinicians who, with other frontline health care workers, demonstrated extraordinary collaboration, compassion and innovation.” 

The full year and fourth quarter results reflect continued strong performance, impacted by COVID-19 care costs, continued voluntary consumer and customer assistance initiatives and other pandemic-related factors. As expected, fourth quarter net earnings of $2.30 per share and adjusted earnings of $2.52 per share declined as care patterns normalized, while COVID-19 costs rose, and further rebate effects were recognized. The 2020 results were consistent with the outlook provided by the Company at its December 1st, 2020 Investor Conference.  

The Company affirmed its recently issued full year earnings outlook for 2021, including net earnings of $16.90 to $17.40 per share and adjusted net earnings of $17.75 to $18.25 per share. As previously discussed, this outlook includes approximately $1.80 per share in potential net unfavorable impact to accommodate continuing COVID-19 effects, such as: testing and treatment costs; the residual impact of people deferring care in 2020; and unemployment and other economy-driven factors.

•UnitedHealth Group’s full year 2020 revenues of $257.1 billion grew $15.0 billion or 6.2% year-over-year, reflecting broad-based revenue growth across the businesses. 

•Full year 2020 earnings from operations grew $2.7 billion or 13.8% year-over-year to $22.4 billion, with both UnitedHealthcare and Optum contributing to the expansion.

•The full year 2020 medical care ratio of 79.1% declined from 82.5% in 2019 primarily impacted by the return of the health insurance tax and disrupted care patterns earlier in the year, offset by the Company’s COVID-19 assistance measures and testing and treatment costs. Favorable medical reserve development was $850 million in the quarter, with $770 million related to 2020. Year-end days claims payable were 47.8 days compared to 46.8 days in the third quarter 2020 and 50.8 days at year end 2019, with the year-over-year comparison impacted by timing factors, including the Company’s voluntary acceleration of payments to assist care providers.

•The full year 2020 operating cost ratio of 16.2% increased from 14.5% in 2019 as continued operating efficiency gains were offset by the return of the health insurance tax, COVID-19 response efforts, business mix and increased investments in service, innovation and growth. 

•Cash flows from operations in 2020 of $22.2 billion, or 1.4 times net income, grew 20.1% year-over-year. Fourth quarter cash flows were stronger than anticipated, partly on timing factors. 

•Return on equity of 24.9% in 2020 reflected the Company’s strong overall operating performance and efficient capital structure.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•UnitedHealthcare full year revenues of $200.9 billion compare to $193.8 billion last year, as growth in serving community and senior programs was partially offset by commercial enrollment declines. UnitedHealthcare community and senior program revenues grew by 8.0% in 2020, with an additional 1.2 million people served in Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, while commercial revenue growth was impacted by pandemic-related economic factors.

•Full year operating earnings were $12.4 billion compared to $10.3 billion last year, with the care pattern disruption which occurred in the second quarter offset by the Company’s efforts to help people obtain needed care, increased COVID-19 testing and care costs and rebate and customer assistance effects. 

•Fourth quarter operating results reflect restoration of care patterns, the Company’s continued efforts to provide support and relief efforts to correct economic imbalances caused by the pandemic and additional reserves for rebates and related activity as calendar year assessments were concluded.

•UnitedHealthcare growth highlights for 2021 include: serving an expected up to 1.5 million more people in total, with  growth in Individual and Group Medicare Advantage and Dual Special Needs Plans approaching 900,000 people; Medicaid growth with new market entries in Kentucky, Indiana, and North Carolina along with a strong proposal pipeline for both existing and new states; commercial market and specialty expansion, with newly introduced consumer-centric offerings, such as physician-led plans, expected to grow again at a strong-double digit pace.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE

(in millions, except per share data)

(unaudited)

ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE(a)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Adjusted net earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted net earnings per share excludes from the relevant GAAP metric, as applicable, intangible amortization and other items, if any, that do not relate to the Company's underlying business performance. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. As amortization fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share.
