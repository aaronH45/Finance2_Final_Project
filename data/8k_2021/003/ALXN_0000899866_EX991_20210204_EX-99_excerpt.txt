COVID-19

We continue to take steps to proactively respond to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and to plan for related uncertainties. We remain focused on continuing to serve patients, protecting the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we live and work, and supporting patients in clinical trials. We are also focused on minimizing potential interactions that could contribute to the spread of the virus and put additional strain on healthcare systems through the use of innovative virtual means where possible. 

•Clinical Trials: We have implemented a pandemic response business continuity plan designed to protect patients and site staff safety while continuing our clinical trials with limited interruption to the extent we are able. The COVID-19 impact has varied by study and program, but there has been little timing impact on fully-enrolled trials. By the third quarter of 2020, we had successfully re-initiated the majority of studies that had been temporarily paused earlier in the year. However, increasing COVID-19 cases have had further effects on the timing of healthy volunteer studies in particular. In addition, there has been, and may continue to be, an impact to the timing of trials that are enrolling patients and activating sites, or have not yet started to do so, based on local dynamics where these studies are being conducted.

•Business Impact: We continue to take proactive measures designed to mitigate the risk of potential interruptions in supply and/or access to patients' customary site-of-care locations. Treatment compliance rates across all our medicines have remained strong. We have also seen the predicted slowing of new patient initiations and delays in treatment starts, and we are continuing to closely monitor this environment as the pandemic continues.

Research and Development

(8) In July 2020, we sold certain intellectual property rights and assets to Inozyme Pharma in exchange for $14.8 million of Inozyme common stock. As a result, we recognized a gain on the sale during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.

(9) (Gains) and losses related to strategic equity investments include unrealized gains and losses in investment income to adjust our strategic equity investments to fair value. In addition, during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we recognized an impairment charge of $49.0 million on our option to acquire the remaining equity of Caelum Biosciences (Caelum). In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement with AstraZeneca in December 2020, we determined that the fair value of our option decreased as a result of a change to the expected option exercise date. 

(10) In December 2019, we amended the terms our of our agreement with Caelum with respect to the option to acquire the remaining equity in Caelum. In conjunction with this amendment, we recognized a gain of $32.0 million in other income and (expense), which reflects an increase in the fair value of the option, less incremental upfront funding and the change in the fair value of contingent payments which we also modified as a part of amendment.

Non-GAAP income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 also excludes certain one-time tax benefits of $95.7 million and $30.3 million associated with a tax election made with respect to intellectual property of Wilson and a release of an existing valuation allowance, respectively.
