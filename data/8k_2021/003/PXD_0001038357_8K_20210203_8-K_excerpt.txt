Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Actions

On February 3, 2021, at its regularly scheduled first quarter meeting, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (the "Company") approved the actions summarized below with regard to the compensation of Scott D. Sheffield, the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO"), and the Company's other "named executive officers" (the executive officers of the Company for whom disclosure was required in the Company's proxy statement for its 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, referred to in this report as "NEOs").

Base Salaries. The Committee set 2021 base salaries for the NEOs, including Mr. Richard P. Dealy, who served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer during 2020 and was named President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company effective January 1, 2021, as follows:

2020 Annual Cash Bonus Incentive Program Target Percentages. The Committee did not increase the target bonus percentages for the NEOs under the Company's 2021 Annual Cash Bonus Incentive Program. The 2021 bonus target percentage for each NEO is set forth below, and is shown as a percentage of 2021 base salary, but the actual amount paid may be less than, equal to or greater than the target level depending on performance (but not greater than 250% of target):

Long-Term Incentive Plan Program Awards. The allocation of the target value of the NEOs' equity awards between performance units and time-based awards was unchanged from 2020, being 100% allocated to performance units for the CEO and, for the other NEOs, 60% allocated to performance units and 40% allocated to time-based awards. The Committee granted awards of restricted stock and performance units under the Company's Amended and Restated 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan to the NEOs as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The time-based restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards will vest ratably over three years, provided the officer remains employed with the Company. For tax reasons, the awards to Messrs. Berg and Cheatwood were granted in the form of restricted stock units, which generally have the same terms as the restricted stock, including being settled in common stock of the Company over a three-year vesting period. The NEOs' equity award agreements provide for a double trigger; that is, the 

awards will not automatically accelerate upon a change in control, and will only vest prior to the scheduled vesting date if a qualifying termination event occurs.

Performance units entitle the recipient to the payment of shares if, and only if, the performance of the Company's common stock relative to that of the Company's peers ranks the Company above a "threshold" level. Payouts can range from zero percent to 250 percent of the target number of performance units depending on the Company's relative ranking. Dividends declared during the performance period will be paid at the end of the three- year performance period only on shares delivered for earned units up to a maximum of target shares. The NEOs' equity award agreements for the performance units also provide for a double trigger. Vesting will not automatically accelerate upon a change in control, and will only vest prior to the vesting date if a qualifying termination event occurs; provided that payout will be measured based on the Company's actual performance as of the date of the change in control.

2020 Annual Cash Bonus Program Incentive Payout. The Committee approved the payout of cash bonus awards to the NEOs, based on the Committee's assessment of 2020 performance, as follows:
