“Last year brought challenges the likes of which we have never before experienced, and I am proud of how we came together as an organization to help our employees, partners, customers, and communities. We never lost sight of the necessity to build for the future, one in which the acceleration of digital adoption is profound. We quickly deployed digital assets to help our partners navigate this new environment and we continue to make investments for the future. In 2020, we renewed 41 key relationships, won 25 new deals, and launched promising new programs with Verizon and Venmo. We also took a deep look at our organization to decisively reduce costs to appropriately align the expenses of our business while maintaining investments in our long-term strategy,” said Margaret Keane, Chief Executive Officer, Synchrony Financial. “With Synchrony in a position of strength, now is the right time to implement the leadership transition announced earlier this month. Effective April 1, I will transition to the role of Executive Chair of our Board of Directors, and Brian Doubles will become President and CEO, allowing him to continue the incredible progress that has been made and drive the next stage of Synchrony’s exciting growth journey.”
