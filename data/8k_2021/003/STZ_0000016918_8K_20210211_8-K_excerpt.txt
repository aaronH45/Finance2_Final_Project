Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure

Canopy Growth Corporation (“Canopy”) recently disclosed its results for its third quarter fiscal 2021. Constellation Brands, Inc. (“Constellation” or the “Company”) recognizes equity in earnings (losses) from its equity method investment in Canopy on a two-month lag, details of which appear below. 

Constellation will recognize its share of Canopy’s results of operations and related activities for the period (i) October 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, in its consolidated financial statements for the three months ended February 28, 2021, and (ii) January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, in its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. Based on the information Canopy provides to Constellation in connection with the Amended Investor Rights Agreement and information Canopy has publicly disclosed, Constellation has analyzed its share of Canopy’s results of operations for the period October 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, and for the period January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, that Constellation currently expects to recognize for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. Constellation’s equity in earnings (losses) and related activities of Canopy is being recognized for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, as appearing in the table below. Equity in earnings (losses) and related activities from the Canopy equity method investment is determined by recording the effect of basis differences which include, among other items, the amortization of the fair value adjustments associated with the definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and restructuring and other strategic business development costs. After applying Constellation’s ownership percentage in the applicable period this amount is then converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars using the weighted average exchange rate for the applicable period.

The following table presents the impact on Constellation’s net income (loss) of the equity in earnings (losses) and related activities of Canopy’s results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, on a reported basis (GAAP), and the impact on Constellation’s net income (loss) of the equity in earnings (losses) on a comparable basis (Non-GAAP) recognized in the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2021:

(1)The amounts shown represent Constellation's share of Canopy's results of operations, as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(2)The effective tax rate applied to Constellation’s equity in earnings (losses) of Canopy is generally based on the tax rates and utilization assumptions of the legal entities that hold Constellation’s investment in Canopy. This rate is based on information currently available and is subject to change upon the determination of Constellation’s results for its fourth fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2021.

(3)The effective tax rate applied to each comparable adjustment amount is generally based upon the jurisdiction in which the comparable adjustment was recognized.

The information in the table above is “furnished” and not “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is not otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such information may be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933 only if and to the extent such subsequent filing specifically references the information incorporated by reference herein.

The table above contains non-GAAP financial measures; these are referred to as “comparable” measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant’s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided reconciliations within the table of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Comparable measures, including those presenting the impact of the Company’s equity method investment in Canopy, are provided because management uses this information to monitor the Company’s investment in Canopy. In addition, the Company believes this information provides investors valuable insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year-over-year financial performance.
