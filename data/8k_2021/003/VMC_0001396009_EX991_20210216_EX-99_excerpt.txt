VULCAN REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS 

Strong Full-Year Results Reflect Improvements in Aggregates Unit Profitability 

Solid Earnings Growth Expected in 2021 

Birmingham, Alabama – February 16, 2021 – Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates, today announced results for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. 

Tom Hill, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our best-in-class aggregates business, along with the efforts and dedication of our employees, allowed us to overcome COVID-19 related disruptions in 2020. Most impressive, we delivered year-over-year gains in aggregates unit profitability throughout each quarter in 2020. Our ability to leverage Vulcan’s four strategic disciplines enabled us to expand unit margins, deliver improved cash flows, and increase returns on invested capital. Our team’s hard work along with Vulcan’s leading market positions and strong financial footing will enable us to capitalize on an improving demand outlook in 2021.” 

Net earnings were $115 million in the fourth quarter, and Adjusted EBITDA was $311 million. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA increased 4 percent despite a 1 percent decline in total revenues. Effective cost management throughout the organization and aggregates price growth helped drive margin expansion. 

Full year revenues were $4.86 billion, 1 percent lower than the prior year, while gross profit margins expanded across each segment driving an improvement of 150 basis points in the Company’s EBITDA margin. Net earnings were $584 million, and Adjusted EBITDA was a record $1.324 billion. 

Mr. Hill continued, “Construction employment gains in key markets are a positive signal that activity levels are recovering across our footprint, as compelling fundamentals in residential construction support growing demand in 2021. Shipments into private nonresidential continue to benefit from growth in heavy industrial projects such as data centers and warehouses, while construction starts in other categories remain below the prior year. Recent improvements in highway lettings and contract awards indicate growing confidence and visibility fueling advancement of planned projects, particularly in the second half of 2021. The pricing environment remains positive, and we continue to execute at a high level, positioning us well for 2021. We expect our 2021 Adjusted EBITDA will range between $1.340 billion to $1.440 billion.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Highlights as of December 31, 2020 include: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reported earnings from continuing operations for the year were $588 million, or $4.41 per diluted share. Comparing adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $4.68 per diluted share in 2020 to $4.70 per diluted share in 2019, the prior year benefited from a lower tax rate due to certain tax benefits and credits that were higher than in 2020. The effect of the resulting higher tax rate in 2020 was $0.18 per diluted share. 

Segment Results 

Aggregates 

Fourth quarter gross profit increased to $276 million due to growth in pricing and effective cost control, despite a 1 percent decline in shipments. Gains in unit profitability were widespread and marked the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in gross profit per ton. For the full year, gross profit per ton increased 5 percent, despite 3 percent lower volumes. This growth marks the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in the Company’s trailing-twelve-month unit profitability. 

The pricing environment continues to be positive across the Company’s footprint. On a mix-adjusted basis, all of the Company’s markets reported full year price growth. For the year, mix-adjusted pricing increased 3.1 percent (reported freight-adjusted sales price increased 3.2 percent) despite a 3 percent decline in shipments. For the quarter, mix-adjusted sales price increased 1.8 percent, and reported freight-adjusted pricing increased 3.3 percent. 

Fourth quarter operating efficiencies and lower diesel fuel costs helped to mitigate increased spending to remove overburden ahead of future shipments and the timing of repair costs. The Aggregates segment earnings impact from lower diesel fuel cost was $8 million in the quarter. For the full year, freight-adjusted unit cost of sales increased 2 percent and 1 percent on a cash basis. Flexible operating plans, disciplined cost control, and lower diesel fuel costs mitigated the impact of operational disruptions caused by the pandemic during the year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium 

Fourth quarter gross profit increased sharply in each segment. Asphalt segment gross profit increased 53 percent to $17 million in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher material margins (sales price less unit cost of raw materials). Segment earnings benefited from price discipline and effective cost containment, including lower liquid asphalt costs. Shipments in the current year’s quarter were lower than the prior year, as prior year shipments included certain large projects in the Arizona and Tennessee markets. 

Fourth quarter concrete segment gross profit increased 28 percent to $9 million as a result of higher material margins. Shipments decreased 12 percent versus the prior year, and average selling prices increased 2 percent compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter shipments were impacted by the lingering effects of cement supply shortages in Northern California. 

Calcium segment gross profit was $1.2 million versus $0.8 million in the prior year quarter. 

Full year segment earnings increased 12 percent collectively, driven by strong year-over-year improvement in asphalt. Each segment reported year-over-year margin expansion on lower revenues. 

Selling, Administrative and General (SAG) and Other Nonoperating Expense 

SAG expense was $99 million in the quarter and $360 million for the full year. As a percentage of total revenues, SAG expense was 7.4 percent in 2020. The Company remains focused on further leveraging its overhead cost structure. 

Other nonoperating expense was $21 million, compared to income of $3 million in the prior year quarter. This year-over-year change resulted from a non-cash pension settlement charge of $23 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, recorded in the fourth quarter in connection with a voluntary lump sum distribution of benefits to certain fully vested plan participants. This action will benefit future expense and funding requirements. 

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Allocation  

Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $132 million and $361 million for the full year, most of which was directed toward core operating and maintenance projects. During the fourth quarter, the Company restarted planned growth projects that were put on hold in March 2020 as a result of the pandemic. In 2021, the Company expects to spend between $450 and $475 million on capital expenditures, including growth projects. The Company will continue to review its plans and will adjust as needed, while being thoughtful about preserving liquidity.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

In 2020, the Company returned $180 million to shareholders through dividends, a 10 percent increase versus the prior year. For the year, the Company repurchased $26 million in common stock. 

At year end, total debt to trailing-twelve month Adjusted EBITDA was 2.5 times or 1.6 times on a net debt basis reflecting $1.2 billion of cash on hand. Approximately $500 million will be used to pay off certain debt maturities due in March 2021. The Company’s weighted-average debt maturity was 13 years, and the effective weighted-average interest rate was 4.1 percent. 

Return on invested capital increased 40 basis points from the prior year to 14.3 percent. Operating cash flows were $1.1 billion, up 9 percent versus the previous year. Solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management led to these results. 

Outlook 

Regarding the Company’s outlook, Mr. Hill stated, “We are encouraged by the continued strength in residential construction activity, particularly single-family housing. Our expectation is also supported by the recent improvement in highway awards and construction employment trends in key markets. Data centers, distribution centers, and warehouses, which now comprise the largest share of new private nonresidential project awards, will continue to underpin demand in this end market. We believe these leading indicators, along with sustaining a positive pricing environment, can be a catalyst for further recovery in construction activity during 2021.” 

Management expectations for 2021 include: 

 ·Aggregates shipments down 2 percent to up 2 percent versus 2020 

 ·Year-over-year aggregates freight-adjusted price increase of 2 to 4 percent 

 ·Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium gross profit up mid-to-high single digits 

 ·SAG expenses of $365 to $375 million 

 ·Interest expense of approximately $130 million 

 ·Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense of approximately $400 million 

 ·An effective tax rate of approximately 21 percent 

 ·Earnings from continuing operations of $4.80 to $5.40 per diluted share 

 ·Adjusted EBITDA of $1.340 to $1.440 billion 

 ·No major changes in COVID shelter-in-place restrictions  

Mr. Hill concluded, “As we saw in 2020, demand for our products can be subject to market fluctuations outside of our control. That said, we remained focused on the factors within our control, including our pricing and cost actions, both of which contributed to further improvement in our industry-leading unit margins in 2020. We will carry that determination through 2021 and beyond. Our operating plans are underpinned by our four strategic disciplines (Commercial and Operational Excellence, Logistics Innovation and Strategic Sourcing), a healthy balance sheet, strong liquidity, and the engagement of our people.”

 1.Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures  

Aggregates segment freight-adjusted revenues is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) measure. We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight & delivery, which are pass-through activities. It also excludes immaterial other revenues related to services, such as landfill tipping fees, that are derived from our aggregates business. Additionally, we use this metric as the basis for calculating the average sales price of our aggregates products. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: 

Aggregates Segment Freight-Adjusted Revenues 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1At the segment level, freight & delivery revenues include intersegment freight & delivery (which are eliminated at the consolidated level) and freight to remote distribution sites.  

Aggregates segment incremental gross profit flow-through rate is not a GAAP measure and represents the year-over-year change in gross profit divided by the year-over-year change in segment sales excluding freight & delivery (revenues and costs). We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight & delivery, which are pass-through activities. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:

GAAP does not define "Aggregates segment cash gross profit" and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We and the investment community use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business. Additionally, we present this metric as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. Aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton is computed by dividing Aggregates segment cash gross profit by tons shipped. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:

 Appendix 2  

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures (Continued) 

GAAP does not define "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization" (EBITDA) and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. We adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of earnings performance from period to period. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1Represents non-routine charges or gains associated with acquisitions including the cost impact of purchase accounting inventory valuations.  

Similar to our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, we present Adjusted Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations to provide a more consistent comparison of earnings performance from period to period. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: 

Adjusted Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations (Adjusted Diluted EPS) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure and should not be considered as an alternative to metrics defined by GAAP. We, the investment community and credit rating agencies use this metric to assess our leverage. Net debt subtracts cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash from total debt. Reconciliation to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: 

Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Appendix 3  

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures (Continued) 

We define "Return on Invested Capital" (ROIC) as Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing-twelve months divided by average invested capital (as illustrated below) during the trailing 5-quarters. Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric EBITDA. We believe that our ROIC metric is meaningful because it helps investors assess how effectively we are deploying our assets. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. 

 Return on Invested Capital  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1Average invested capital is based on a trailing 5-quarters.  

The following reconciliation to the mid-point of the range of 2021 Projected EBITDA excludes adjustments (as noted in Adjusted EBITDA above) as they are difficult to forecast (timing or amount). Due to the difficulty in forecasting such adjustments, we are unable to estimate their significance. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:
