Item 8.01 Other Events

On February 19, 2021, Discovery Communications, LLC (“DCL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Discovery, Inc., issued a notice for the redemption in full of all $335,283,000 aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 4.375% Notes due 2021 (CUSIP: 25470DAE9) (the “Notes”) in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the Notes. 

The Notes will be redeemed on March 21, 2021 (the “Redemption Date”), at a redemption price with respect to each Note equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury rate plus 25 basis points, plus accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date. 

On the Redemption Date, the redemption price will become due and payable on the Notes and, unless DCL defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest on the Notes will cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date. The notice of redemption specifying the terms, conditions and procedures for the redemption is available through U.S. Bank National Association, located at One Federal Street, 3rd Floor, Boston, Massachusetts, 02110, as paying agent for the Notes. The foregoing does not constitute a notice of redemption for the Notes.
