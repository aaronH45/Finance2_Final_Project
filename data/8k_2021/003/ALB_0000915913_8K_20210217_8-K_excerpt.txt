Section 2 - Financial Information

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On February 17, 2021, Albemarle Corporation (the “Company”) issued a press release reporting its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, on February 18, 2021, the Company will hold a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The teleconference will be webcast on the Company’s website at www.albemarle.com.

The press release includes presentations of adjusted net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective income tax rates, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA margin. These are financial measures that are not required by, nor presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), but are included to provide additional useful measurements to review our operations, provide transparency to investors and enable period-to-period comparability of financial performance.

Our presentations of adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted effective income tax rates should not be considered as alternatives to Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation (“earnings”), diluted earnings per share and effective income tax rates as determined in accordance with GAAP. Further, EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered as alternatives to earnings as a percentage of our consolidated net sales as would be determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included in the press release certain reconciliation information for these measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.

In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
