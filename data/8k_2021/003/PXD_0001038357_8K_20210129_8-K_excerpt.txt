Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement  

On January 29, 2021, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (the “Company”) completed the public offering of $2,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of debt securities, consisting of $750.0 million of the Company’s 0.750% Senior Notes that will mature January 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), $750.0 million of the Company’s 1.125% Senior Notes that will mature January 15, 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and $1.0 billion of the Company’s 2.150% Senior Notes that will mature January 15, 2031 (the “2031 Notes,” and together with the 2024 Notes and the 2026 Notes, the “New Notes”), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”), dated January 14, 2021, by and among the Company and BofA Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and TD Securities (USA) LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein.  

The Company issued the New Notes pursuant to an indenture, dated June 26, 2012 (the “Base Indenture”), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented with respect to the New Notes by a fourth supplemental indenture, dated January 29, 2021 (the “Fourth Supplemental Indenture”), by and between the Company and the Trustee.  

The Base Indenture was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) as Exhibit 4.5 to the Company’s automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-241031) filed with the Commission on August 5, 2020 (the “Registration Statement”). The Fourth Supplemental Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto, and the terms and conditions thereof are incorporated herein by reference. The forms of the 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2031 Notes (together, the “Global Notes”) issued pursuant to the Fourth Supplemental Indenture are filed as Exhibits 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 hereto, respectively, and the terms and conditions of the Global Notes are incorporated herein by reference. The Global Notes are also filed with reference to, and are hereby incorporated by reference into, the Registration Statement.  

The Company offered the New Notes pursuant to the prospectus supplement dated January 14, 2021 (the “Prospectus Supplement”), to the prospectus dated August 5, 2020, which forms a part of the Registration Statement. The material terms of the New Notes are described in the Prospectus Supplement.  

In connection with the Tender Offers (as defined below), the Company also solicited consents (the “Consent Solicitations”) from holders of the Tender Offer Notes (as defined below) to amend (the “Proposed Amendments”) each Tender Offer Indenture (as defined below) to, among other things, (i) eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and related provisions and certain events of default contained in each Tender Offer Indenture and (ii) shorten the minimum notice requirement for optional redemptions to three days.
