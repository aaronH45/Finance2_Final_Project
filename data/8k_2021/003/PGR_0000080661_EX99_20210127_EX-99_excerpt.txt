1Excluding the extra week of underwriting activity during December 2019, growth would have been approximately:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

N/A - Our Property business results have a comparable number of operating days in 2020 and 2019.

a Net premiums written growth was also negatively impacted for the month due to renewing certain transportation network company (TNC) policies originally written for $98 million in December 2019 in fiscal August 2020. Excluding this impact, net premiums written growth would have been approximately 41% for December 2020, reflecting the continued strong written premium growth in the traditional business market targets, especially the for-hire trucking business market target, as a result of greater demand for shipping services in light of the pandemic, and a revised estimate of the miles to be driven during the remainder of the TNC policy terms, which is the basis for determining the premiums written on the TNC policies. 

2Included in both the expense ratio and combined ratio is 3.0 points of amortization expense predominately associated with the acquisition of a controlling interest in ARX. Excluding these additional expenses, the Property business would have reported an expense ratio of 25.8 and a combined ratio of 61.7.

3Represents catastrophe losses incurred during the period as a percent of net premiums earned. We experienced favorable development on 2020 catastrophe losses in our Property business, primarily attributable to Hurricanes Zeta and Eta and wildfires in Oregon.

4Represents adjustments solely based on our normally scheduled actuarial reviews. For our Property business, the actuarial reserving methodology includes changes to catastrophe losses, while the reviews in our vehicle businesses do not include catastrophes.

Monthly Commentary

•Progressive operates on an accounting calendar that typically consists of a 52-week year, with 13-week quarters and a 4-week December. Under this calendar, we periodically recognize an additional week of vehicle underwriting activity, as was the case in 2019. Consequently, our annual, fourth quarter, and December 2019 periods each include an additional week, which affects comparisons to the corresponding periods of 2020.

•Disclosure of monthly results often shows more variability in written premium growth rates than disclosure on a quarterly basis under our accounting calendar. The net premiums written growth rate for December 2020 was negatively impacted, in part, due to the first few days of December, which are historically higher volume premium days, being reported in fiscal November 2020, compared to fiscal December 2019.

•Excluding the impact of catastrophe losses in both December 2020 and 2019, our companywide loss/LAE ratio was 5.0 points lower than December last year, in part reflecting continued lower auto accident frequency on a year-over-year basis. 

Events

Our fourth quarter Investor Relations conference call is currently scheduled to be held on Tuesday, March 2, 2021, at 1:00 p.m. eastern time.

In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when we establish reserves for one or more contingencies. Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results, therefore, may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
