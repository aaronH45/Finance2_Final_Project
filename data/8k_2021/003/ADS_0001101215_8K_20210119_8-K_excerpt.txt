Item 8.01. Other Events. 

Indemnification Update 

On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its Epsilon segment to Publicis Groupe S.A. (“Publicis”). As previously disclosed, under the terms of the agreement governing that transaction, Alliance Data Systems Corporation (the “Company”) agreed to indemnify Publicis and its affiliates from and against any losses arising out of or related to a United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) investigation of Epsilon that was in process at the time the agreement was executed. The DOJ investigation related to third-party marketers who sent, or allegedly sent, deceptive mailings and the provision of data and services to those marketers by Epsilon’s data practice. Epsilon actively cooperated with the DOJ in connection with the investigation. On January 19, 2021, Epsilon and the DOJ filed with the court a deferred prosecution agreement (“DPA”) to resolve the matters that were the subject of the investigation. Pursuant to the DPA, Epsilon agreed, among other things, to pay penalties and consumer compensation in the aggregate amount of $150 million, to be paid in two equal installments, the first in January, 2021 and the second in January, 2022. In accordance with ASC 450, the Company records a loss contingency when a loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Based on the information then available, for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a loss contingency of $40 million ($32.9 million, net of tax), which was included in loss from discontinued operations. Based on the amount of the penalties and consumer compensation Epsilon is required to pay pursuant to the terms of the DPA, for the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company recorded an additional loss contingency of $110 million ($81.3 million, net of tax), which was included in loss from discontinued operations.
