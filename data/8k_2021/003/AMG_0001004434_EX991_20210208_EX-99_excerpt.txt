WEST PALM BEACH, FL, February 8, 2021 — Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE: AMG) today reported its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. 

Jay C. Horgen, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMG, said:

“AMG reported Adjusted EBITDA of $255 million in the fourth quarter; the year-over-year growth of 27% reflects strong investment performance from our Affiliates across a broad array of alpha-oriented strategies, along with the positive impact of strategic investments and actions to reposition the business for growth. Business momentum and net client cash flows were particularly strong in private markets, wealth management, and specialty fixed income during the quarter. Looking ahead, AMG continues to have excellent long-term growth prospects; our Affiliates are well-positioned to benefit from clients’ increasing risk appetite, particularly given their strong track records in attractive product areas. 

“Throughout the challenges of 2020, we invested for growth across both existing and new Affiliates, allocating capital and resources toward the areas of highest growth and return. We were pleased to welcome four excellent new Affiliates over the last 12 months, including most recently Boston Common Asset Management, an innovator in sustainable investing, and Jackson Square Partners, a leader in growth-oriented global equities. With a three-decade track record of successful partnerships, proprietary long-term relationships with prospective Affiliates around the world, and a broader set of partnership solutions for independent firms than ever, AMG is uniquely positioned as the partner of choice for outstanding independent investment firms globally.

“AMG enters 2021 with significant momentum across our business, including strong investment performance in secular growth areas, increasing opportunities to invest in excellent partner-owned firms, and a highly liquid and flexible capital position. With these competitive advantages, along with the enhanced earnings power of our business, we have an outstanding opportunity to create long-term value, through both accretive growth investments, and returning significant capital to shareholders over time.”

Notes

(1) Earnings per share (diluted) adjusts for the dilutive effect of the potential issuance of incremental shares of our common stock. We had junior convertible securities outstanding during the periods presented and are required to apply the if-converted method to these securities in our calculation of Earnings per share (diluted). Under the if-converted method, shares that are issuable upon conversion are deemed outstanding, regardless of whether the securities are contractually convertible into our common stock at that time. For this calculation, the interest expense (net of tax) attributable to these dilutive securities is added back to Net income (controlling interest), reflecting the assumption that the securities have been converted. Issuable shares for these securities and related interest expense are excluded from the calculation if an assumed conversion would be anti-dilutive to diluted earnings per share.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

(2) As supplemental information, we provide non-GAAP performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest), Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share. Management utilizes these non-GAAP performance measures to assess our performance before our share of certain non-cash expenses and to improve comparability between periods. 

Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments, certain Affiliate equity expenses, gains and losses on general partner and seed capital investments, and adjustments to our contingent payment arrangements. We believe that many investors use this non-GAAP measure when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry.

Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method investments in Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements), certain Affiliate equity expenses, and gains and losses on general partner and seed capital investments. Economic net income (controlling interest) is used by management and our Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmark, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. 

Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our junior convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of the junior convertible securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted):

These non-GAAP performance measures are provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest), Earnings per share or other GAAP performance measures. For additional information on our non-GAAP measures, see our Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
