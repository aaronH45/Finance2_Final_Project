Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF Demonstrate Zero Emissions Leadership 

A fuel cell electric Kenworth T680 and a battery electric Peterbilt 579EV recently became the first Class 8 zero emissions vehicles to drive to the 14,115 foot summit of Pikes Peak in Colorado. Both vehicles displayed superb power and exhibited excellent drivability over the 156 turns and switchbacks during the 4,700-foot elevation gain to the summit. The trucks handily negotiated the famous Pikes Peak International Hill Climb course. “PACCAR leads the industry in the development of zero emissions commercial vehicles,” said Darryl Oster, chief engineer global zero emissions.

The Kenworth T680 fuel cell electric vehicle offers 470 hp and a 350-mile range with a 15-minute refill time. Kenworth and Toyota Motor North America are collaborating on a project to develop Kenworth T680 zero emissions trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cell electric powertrains. 

The Peterbilt 579EV that climbed Pikes Peak is designed for optimal weight distribution and performance. The fully integrated, electric powertrain uses thermally-controlled Lithium Ion Phosphate battery packs and can be quickly recharged, making the 579EV ideal for regional haul, port, pickup and delivery and last mile operations.  

Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF are leading the industry with more than 60 hybrid and zero emissions vehicles in customer testing, which have traveled nearly 500,000 miles. Kenworth K270E and T680E, Peterbilt 579EV, 220EV and 520EV, and DAF CF Electric zero emissions trucks became available for customers to order in the third quarter of 2020. Electric vehicle production will begin in the second quarter of 2021.
