Item 8.01 Other Events.

As previously disclosed on June 28, 2020, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (“Chesapeake”) and certain of its subsidiaries (together with Chesapeake, the “Company”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Company’s Chapter 11 Cases were jointly administered under the caption In re Chesapeake Energy Corporation, et al., No. 20-33233 (DRJ).

As previously disclosed, on January 16, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Fifth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Chesapeake Energy Corporation and Its Debtor Affiliates (the “Plan”). The Debtors expect that the effective date of the Plan will occur once all conditions precedent to the Plan have been satisfied (defined in the Plan as the “Effective Date”).

We have recast certain information in this filing to reflect the retrospective application of our reverse stock split effective April 14, 2020 and for information regarding our Chapter 11 Cases for all periods presented in the following sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “Previously Filed Annual Report”) as follows:

•Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data,

•Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,

•Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and

•Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

As this Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed only for the purpose described above, and only affects the Items specified above, the other information in the Previously Filed Annual Report filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 27, 2020, as well as the Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on April 29, 2020, remains unchanged. No attempt has been made in this Current Report on Form 8-K to modify or update disclosures in the Previously Filed Annual Report, except for the revision of certain financial information as described above. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Previously Filed Annual Report. Accordingly, this Current Report on Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the Previously Filed Annual Report and the Company’s filings made with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Previously Filed Annual Report, including any amendments to those filings.
