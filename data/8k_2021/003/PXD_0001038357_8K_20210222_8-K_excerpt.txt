Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review

Corrections to Previously Issued Financial Statements

(a) On February 22, 2021, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") of the Company, after discussion with management and Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, concluded that the Company's previously issued unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 should no longer be relied upon.

In connection with the preparation of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the "2020 Form 10-K"), management became aware that the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 contained misstatements related to two long-term marketing contracts that should have been accounted for as derivative contracts. The contracts were executed in October 2019, each with a January 1, 2021 contract commencement date and a December 31, 2026 contract termination date. In order to properly account for the contracts as derivatives, certain noncash revisions will be made to the September 30, 2020 consolidated financial statements.

Accordingly, the Company will restate its unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 in its 2020 Form 10-K. The effects of the noncash corrections to the Company's previously reported unaudited consolidated statements of operations are as follows (unaudited, in millions, except for per share data):

The effects of the noncash corrections on the Company's previously reported unaudited consolidated balance sheet are as follows (in millions):

The Company will also make other immaterial revisions to its first and second quarter 2020 unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and its 2019 audited consolidated financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K, principally related to the derivative treatment of the marketing contracts. The Company's net cash flows from operating activities, investing activities or financing activities were not impacted for any prior period. 

The Company has not filed and does not intend to file an amendment to the Company's previously filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2020. Investors and others should rely on the financial information and 

other disclosures regarding the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 included herein, in the 2020 Form 10-K and in future filings with the SEC (as applicable).

Management of the Company has concluded the control deficiency that resulted in the failure to detect the misstatement described above is a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 relating to the design and maintenance of internal controls over the review of marketing contracts for indicators of derivative accounting. The Company will report the material weakness in the 2020 Form 10-K and is implementing additional controls to remediate the material weakness in 2021.

The Company's management and the Audit Committee have discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02 with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP.
