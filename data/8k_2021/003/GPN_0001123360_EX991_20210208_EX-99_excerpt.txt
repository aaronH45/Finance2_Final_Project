Delivers EPS Growth and Strong Margin Performance for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020

Sets 2021 Growth Targets

Partners with Google for Digital Merchant Solutions Worldwide

Increases Share Repurchase Authorization to $1.5 Billion and Announces Plan for $500 Million 

Accelerated Share Repurchase

ATLANTA -- Global Payments Inc. (NYSE: GPN) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020.

“We are pleased to have ended 2020 with continued sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, highlighting the consistency of our execution since the beginning of the pandemic," said Jeff Sloan, Chief Executive Officer. "We also continue to make significant progress delivering against our strategic objectives, culminating in the announcement today of our new partnership with Google to substantially expand the opportunity set for our merchant solutions business. None of this would have been possible without the dedication of our exceptional team members during this challenging period, and we thank them for their commitment to our customers and communities.

“Our new collaboration with Google advances our merchant business competitively by driving incremental revenue and lowering operating costs through a multi-year worldwide go-to-market distribution and product development relationship combined with utilization of cutting edge, transformative cloud native technologies. Together we will bring new best-in-class digital products to market worldwide more quickly, and we will further accelerate our culture of market-leading innovation.

“Our company accomplished a great deal over the last twelve months,” Sloan continued. “Across our merchant and issuer segments, we have struck significant and unique distribution relationships with two of the world’s largest and most sophisticated technology companies with a combined market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion. Together, we will leapfrog legacy means of distribution and redefine how payment technologies for merchants and issuers are sold and consumed in the digital age.

“In addition, our Netspend business has played a critical role in the disbursement of more than $2.5 billion in stimulus funds to those most in need domestically, in many cases days in advance of traditional and financial technology competitors because of the depth and breadth of our network. We also expanded our target addressable market in 2020 by entering continental Europe and leveraging our multinational footprint.”

Sloan concluded, “These accomplishments would have been meaningful in any year but are especially so given the challenges presented by COVID-19. We expect these milestones to deepen our competitive moat and extend ongoing share gains. We exited 2020 in a better position than we entered it.”

Financial Highlights and 2021 Outlook

“Our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020 exceeded our expectations post COVID-19 and highlights our outstanding execution and the resiliency of our business model,” said Paul Todd, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Our technology-enabled payments strategy coupled with the decisive expense actions taken at the onset of the pandemic allowed us to generate substantial adjusted operating margin expansion, adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow despite the impact of the pandemic on the worldwide economy.

“Given significant progress with our integration activities, we are again raising our expectations for both revenue and expense synergies within three years from the close of the TSYS merger. Specifically, we now expect annual run rate revenue synergies to amount to at least $150 million by September 2022, an increase from our prior estimate of $125 million; and we expect annual run rate expense synergies to amount to at least $400 million by September 2022, an increase from our prior estimate of $375 million.

“Based on our outlook for 2021, we are excited to return to growth across our segments this year. We currently expect full year 2021 adjusted net revenue to be in a range of $7.50 billion to $7.60 billion, representing growth of 11% to 13%. Consistent with the target we provided on our third quarter call, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $7.75 to $8.05, reflecting growth of 21% to 26% over 2020 despite the adverse impact of additional lock-downs and social distancing protocols in a number of our markets since late October. This outlook presumes we continue on a path toward recovery worldwide over the course of the year."

Todd concluded, “We have also returned to our traditional capital allocation priorities, and our Board of Directors has approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion. As part of that program, we intend to execute an accelerated share repurchase program for $500 million in the coming days.”

Capital Allocation

Global Payments’ Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.195 per share payable March 26, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 12, 2021 and also approved an increase to the existing authorization for the company's share repurchase program, raising the total available authorization to $1.5 billion.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Global Payments supplements revenues, income, operating income, operating margin and EPS determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP by providing these measures with certain adjustments (such measures being non-GAAP financial measures) in this document to assist with evaluating our performance. In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to focus on the factors the company believes are pertinent to the daily management of our operations. Management believes adjusted net revenue more closely reflects the economic benefits to the company's core business and allows for better comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, together with other metrics, to set goals for and measure the performance of the business and to determine incentive compensation. Adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, revenues, operating income, net income and EPS determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Adjusted net revenue excludes gross-up related payments associated with certain lines of business to reflect economic benefits to the company. On a GAAP basis, these payments are presented gross in both revenues and operating expenses. Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude acquisition-related amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration expense and certain other items, such as unusual, direct and discrete costs due to the global pandemic, specific to each reporting period as more fully described in the accompanying reconciliations in Schedules 6 and 7. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenue. The tax rate used in determining the income tax impact of earnings adjustments is either the jurisdictional statutory rate in effect at the time of the adjustment or the jurisdictional expected annual effective tax rate for the period, depending on the nature and timing of the adjustment.
