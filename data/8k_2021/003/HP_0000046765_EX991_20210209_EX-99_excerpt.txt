 President and CEO John Lindsay commented, “Like many, we entered 2021 with a combined sense of relief and optimism - relieved that one of the most difficult years in the Company's 100-year history is behind us and optimistic given our market share gains during our first fiscal quarter of 2021. We exited the first fiscal quarter with 94 rigs, double the number we had active at the trough in August, and the upward trend continues. We are also encouraged by the recent worldwide deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, improved crude oil prices and the progress we are making on strategic efforts to deploy additional digital technology solutions and to advance new commercial models. 

"Global uncertainty related to COVID-19 and the possibility of future industry and economic volatility certainly temper our short-term optimism, and we remain cognizant that even in a stable or improving environment there remains several challenges ahead for both the Company and the industry. We are pleased with our recent gains in technology solution deployments and performance-based contracts, but are aware of the work that remains and the additional efforts around change management that must occur within the industry. Accordingly, improvements in both technology solutions and performance-based contract adoptions are not likely to be linear and may not always correlate with our rig count. That said, we remain steadfast and confident in our ability to lead and effect change in our industry. 

"H&P's customer-centric approach of combining our people, rigs and leading-edge automation technology differentiates H&P within the industry, and is empowering us to deliver the highest-value wells for our customers. An underlying principle of our performance contracts is to create sustainable 'win-win' scenarios based not only on efficiency, but also wellbore quality and placement. When successful, these contracts lead to superior well economics and returns for both our customers and H&P as well. Another key component in improving well economics is the use of H&P's patented drilling automation software that helps to enable higher quality wells to be drilled on a more consistent basis with lower levels of risk. To date, our autonomous AutoSlide® technology is deployed on 25-30% of our FlexRig® fleet and we currently have similar percentages for performance-based contracts."

 Senior Vice President and CFO Mark Smith also commented, "The Company exited the recent fiscal quarter with $524 million in cash and short-term investments, a debt-to-cap of 13% and approximately $1.3 billion in available liquidity. H&P's ability to emerge well positioned from a very challenging year is a testament to our balance sheet strength and underscores the importance of maintaining robust financial footing in the volatile, and often unpredictable, times experienced in our cyclical industry. The Company's strong financial foundation underpins our long-term focus and capital allocation strategy including our historic practice of providing returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 

 "During the first fiscal quarter we incurred significant costs associated with the large number of rig reactivations, which served to temporarily impinge operating margins by approximately $10.6 million. Such costs are necessary as we continue to reactivate rigs and we anticipate additional rig reactivations during the second fiscal quarter albeit at a more modest pace. While we are pleased to see activity improve during the first fiscal quarter as well as H&P's ability to quickly respond to customer demand, we also have more work to do on cost management, which overshadows the positive contributions performance-based contracts and our automated technology solution offerings are having on our financial performance."

 John Lindsay concluded, “I am pleased with the progress our Company is making on its strategic initiatives, particularly given the economic and industry headwinds we are navigating. As we have indicated previously, introducing disruptive technologies and business models is a long and sometimes unpredictable process. I believe our dedicated teams are well-equipped and our conservative financial stewardship has enabled us to capitalize on the challenges and opportunities ahead."

Operating Segment Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021

North America Solutions:

This segment had an operating loss of $73 million compared to an operating loss of $78 million during the previous quarter. The decrease in the operating loss was driven by a higher level of rig activity and fewer idle but contracted rigs in the fleet; however, operating results were negatively impacted by the costs associated with reactivating rigs during the quarter.

Operating gross margins(1) increased by $5.4 million to $44.7 million as both revenues and expenses increased sequentially. Revenues during the quarter benefited from $5.8 million in early contract termination revenue compared to $11.7 million in the prior quarter and also benefited from fewer idle but contracted rigs within the active fleet. Expenses during the quarter were adversely impacted by costs associated with reactivating 25 idle rigs and 10 idle but contracted rigs and the continued elevated levels of self-insurance expenses. Our technology solutions contribution was modestly above expectations having a positive impact on the overall segment margins.

International Solutions:

This segment had an operating loss of $8.4 million compared to an operating loss of $3.5 million during the previous quarter. Operating gross margins(1) declined to a negative $7.0 million from a negative $1.2 million in the previous quarter due to fewer revenue days as international activity continued to decline. The previous quarter also benefited from certain revenue reimbursements received. This segment continues to carry a higher level of expenses relative to activity levels resulting from compliance with local jurisdictional requirements surrounding COVID-19 as well as minimum levels of fixed overhead in countries where we had no activity during the quarter. The Company continues to explore opportunities to mitigate these expenses, while maintaining strict adherence to local regulations. Current quarter results included a $1.9 million foreign currency loss related to our South American operations compared to an approximate $2.6 million foreign currency loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. 

Offshore Gulf of Mexico:

This segment had operating income of $2.7 million compared to operating income of $1.5 million during the previous quarter. Operating gross margins(1) increased slightly to $6.0 million compared to $4.6 million in the prior quarter as activity levels remained flat.

Operational Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021

North America Solutions:

•We expect North America Solutions operating gross margins(1) to be between $60-$70 million 

•We expect to exit the quarter at between 105-110 contracted rigs 

International Solutions:

•We expect International Solutions operating gross margins(1) to be between $(1)-$(3) million, exclusive of any foreign exchange gains or losses

Offshore Gulf of Mexico:

•We expect Offshore Gulf of Mexico operating gross margins(1) to be between $6-$9 million

Other Estimates for Fiscal Year 2021

•Gross capital expenditures are still expected to be approximately $85 to $105 million; roughly one-third expected for maintenance, roughly one-third expected for skidding to walking conversions and roughly one-third for corporate and information technology. Asset sales include reimbursements for lost and damaged tubulars and sales of other used drilling equipment that offset a portion of the gross capital expenditures and are now expected to total approximately $25 million in fiscal year 2021. Note the sale of the offshore platform rig during the first fiscal quarter 2021 is excluded from this number.

•Depreciation is still expected to be approximately $430 million

•Research and development expenses for fiscal year 2021 are now expected to be roughly $25 to $30 million

•General and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2021 are still expected to be approximately $160 million

COVID-19 Update

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact around the world and on our Company. After falling dramatically in 2020, crude oil prices have recovered, but industry activity still remains at much lower relative levels. The environment in which we operate is still uncertain; however, upon the onset of COVID-19's rapid spread across the United States in early March 2020, we responded quickly and took several actions to maintain the health and safety of H&P employees, customers and stakeholders and to preserve our financial strength. We discussed these actions in our press releases dated, April 30, 2020 and July 28, 2020 and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and will provide updates in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 when filed.

(1) Operations previously reported within the H&P Technologies reportable segment are now managed and presented within the North America Solutions reportable segment. 

Note 1: These operating metrics allow investors to analyze the various components of segment financial results in terms of activity, utilization and other key results. Management uses these metrics to analyze historical segment financial results and as the key inputs for forecasting and budgeting segment financial results. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, these operating metrics replaced previously used per day metrics. As a result, prior year comparative information is also provided above. Segment gross margin and operating income/loss have limitations and should not be used as alternatives to revenues, expenses, or operating income/loss, which are performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

 Segment reconciliation amounts were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Segment operating income (loss) for all segments is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company’s performance, as it excludes gain on sale of assets, corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, corporate restructuring charges, and corporate depreciation. The Company considers segment operating income (loss) to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company’s core businesses. This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company’s reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods. The Company believes that segment operating income (loss) is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers. Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons. However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company’s operating performance in future periods.

 The following table reconciles operating income (loss) per the information above to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes as reported on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:
