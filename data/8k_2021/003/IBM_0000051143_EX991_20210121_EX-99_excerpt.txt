(1) Represents change in GAAP revenue as reported by IBM, which is included in the Cloud & Cognitive Software segment.

(2) Red Hat revenue was included in IBM’s consolidated results beginning July 9, 2019. Revenue for January 1 – July 8, 2019 represents pre-acquisition Red Hat standalone revenue and is included for computing year over year change purposes.

(3) Represents change in the fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 impact of the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment and adjustments to add back revenue which was eliminated for sales between Red Hat and IBM. This line represents revenue that would have been recognized by Red Hat under GAAP if the acquisition had not occurred, but was not recognized by IBM due to purchase accounting and intercompany adjustments.
