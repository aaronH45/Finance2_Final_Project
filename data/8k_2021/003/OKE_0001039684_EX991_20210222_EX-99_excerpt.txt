Spencer, ONEOK president and chief executive officer. “We expect volume and earnings growth in 2021 to be supported by increasing producer activity and new capacity from completed projects. “As energy markets strengthen, we remain focused on profitability, reliable service and the safety and health of our employees,” added Spencer. “ONEOK is well-positioned to serve our customers’ current and future needs while applying our core midstream capabilities in a safe and environmentally responsible way.” FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2020 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ONEOK reported full-year 2020 net income of $612.8 million, which includes noncash impairment charges of $644.9 million. The impairment charges related primarily to goodwill and long-lived assets in the natural gas gathering and processing segment during the first quarter of 2020. Net income also was impacted by a $102.2 million increase in depreciation expense due to  

 ONEOK Announces 11% Year-Over-Year Increase in Fourth Quarter 2020 Operating Income; Announces 2021 Financial Guidance Feb. 22, 2021 Page 3 -more- capital projects being placed in service and higher interest expense due primarily to an increased debt balance and lower capitalized interest. Full-year 2020 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) increased 6%, compared with the full year 2019. Higher results benefited from increased natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin, lower rail transportation and pipeline costs in the natural gas liquids segment due to the completion of ONEOK’s Elk Creek Pipeline, lower operating costs in all three of ONEOK’s business segments, and higher transportation services in the natural gas pipelines segment, compared with the full year 2019. Results were partially offset by lower earnings from optimization and marketing in the natural gas liquids segment, and lower realized commodity prices and Mid-Continent region natural gas volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, compared with the full year 2019. HIGHLIGHTS: • Full-year 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $2,723.7 million, a 6% increase compared with full-year 2019; • Full-year 2020 operating costs of $886.1 million, a 10% decrease compared with full-year 2019; • Completing in December 2020 a partial expansion of the Elk Creek Pipeline to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd); • ESG highlights: ◦ Receiving a perfect score of 100 in the Human Rights Campaign 2021 Corporate Equality Index; ◦ Announcing ONEOK’s inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) for the first time and the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index (DJSI North America) for the second consecutive year; ◦ Being named the DJSI Industry Leader for Oil and Gas Storage and Transportation. • Paying in February 2021 a quarterly dividend of 93.5 cents per share, or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis; • Receiving in November 2020 a first-time credit rating of BBB (outlook stable) from Fitch Ratings.

These non-GAAP financial measures described above are useful to investors because they, and similar measures, are used by many companies in the industry as a measure of financial performance and are commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare our financial performance with the performance of other companies within our industry. Adjusted EBITDA, ONEOK distributable cash flow and dividend coverage ratio should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and coverage ratio are included in the tables. ONEOK, Inc. (pronounced ONE-OAK) (NYSE: OKE) is a leading midstream service provider and owner of one of the nation's premier natural gas liquids (NGL) systems, connecting NGL supply in the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Permian regions with key market centers and an extensive network of natural gas gathering, processing, storage and transportation assets.
