Kelly, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Visa Inc., commented on the results: “Our performance in the fiscal first quarter reflected solid results and continued positive momentum in a challenging COVID-19 environment. We saw sustained strength of debit and eCommerce volumes as well as resilient domestic spending in most countries.

 2 Fiscal First Quarter 2021 — Financial Highlights GAAP net income in the fiscal first quarter was $3.1 billion or $1.42 per share, decreases of 4% and 3%, respectively, over prior year’s results. Current and prior year’s results included $16 million and $13 million of net gains from equity investments, respectively. Current and prior year’s results also included $15 million and $13 million, respectively, related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring acquisition-related costs. Excluding these items and the related tax impacts, non- GAAP net income for the quarter was $3.1 billion or $1.42 per share, decreases of 4% and 3%, respectively, over prior year’s results (refer to the accompanying financial tables for further details and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures presented). Non- GAAP earnings per share decrease was approximately 4% on a constant-dollar basis. All references to earnings per share assume fully-diluted class A share count. Net revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $5.7 billion, a decrease of 6%, primarily driven by the year-over-year decline in cross- border volume, partially offset by growth in payments volume and processed transactions. Net revenues decrease was approximately 6% on a constant-dollar basis. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, it would have had minimal impact on our net revenue growth. Payments volume for the three months ended September 30, 2020, on which fiscal first quarter service revenue is recognized, increased 4% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Payments volume for the three months ended December 31, 2020, increased 5% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe, which drive our international transaction revenues, declined 33% on a constant-dollar basis for the three months ended December 31, 2020. Total cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis declined 21% in the quarter. Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by Visa, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, were 39.2 billion, a 4% increase over the prior year, led by domestic transactions. Fiscal first quarter service revenues were $2.7 billion, an increase of 5% over the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues grew 6% over the prior year to $3.0 billion. International transaction revenues declined 28% over the prior year to $1.5 billion. Other revenues of $384 million rose 5% over the prior year. Client incentives, a contra-revenue item, were $1.9 billion and represent 24.6% of gross revenues. GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion for the fiscal first quarter, a 10% decrease over the prior year's results, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring acquisition-related costs in the current and prior year. Excluding these operating expense items, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 10% over the prior year, primarily driven by general and administrative and marketing expenses. GAAP non-operating expense was $96 million for the fiscal first quarter, including $16 million of net equity investment gains. Excluding this item, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $112 million. GAAP and non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 16.6% for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates benefited from completing certain tax audits. Cash, cash equivalents and investment securities were $18.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average number of diluted shares of class A common stock outstanding was 2.20 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2020.  

3 Other Notable Items Visa continues to monitor the COVID-19 impact globally. During the quarter, several countries experienced a rise in cases and implemented restrictive measures, primarily impacting card present spending. While cross-border spending did improve for the quarter, it remains depressed, led by travel spending, as the majority of borders remain closed. Card not present excluding travel in both domestic and cross-border volume continued to grow at elevated levels. On November 20, 2020, Visa announced it completed the acquisition of YellowPepper. We believe this acquisition will accelerate the adoption of Visa’s “network of networks” strategy in Latin America and the Caribbean by significantly reducing the time-to- market and cost for issuers and processors associated with accessing innovative and interoperable solutions, regardless of who owns or operates the payment rails. On December 14, 2020, Visa repaid $3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of its senior notes. On January 12, 2021, Visa and Plaid announced that the companies mutually terminated their merger agreement and agreed with the Department of Justice to dismiss the litigation related to the proposed transaction. The proposed transaction was first announced on January 13, 2020. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, Visa repurchased 8.7 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $202.30 per share for $1.8 billion. As of January 1, 2021, Visa had $3.6 billion available for share repurchase and on January 26, 2021, the board of directors authorized an additional $8.0 billion class A common stock share repurchase program. On January 26, 2021, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as- converted basis) payable on March 1, 2021, to all holders of record as of February 12, 2021. Financial Outlook for Fiscal Full-Year 2021 Given the continuing impact of COVID-19 and the significant uncertainty in the global economy, it is difficult to reasonably estimate the Company's annual results; therefore we are not providing a fiscal full-year 2021 outlook at this time.

 10 Visa Inc. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Results (unaudited) We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

15 Footnote Payments volume, including Visa Direct volume, represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume for the relevant period, and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks, but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments and cash volume. Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa’s signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs. The data presented is based on transactions processed by Visa and reported by Visa’s financial institution clients on their operating certificates. Estimates may be utilized if data is unavailable. On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates, if any, are not material. Visa’s CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. International includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA, Europe and LAC. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported (“Nominal USD”). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information (“Constant USD”). This presentation represents Visa’s historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement.
