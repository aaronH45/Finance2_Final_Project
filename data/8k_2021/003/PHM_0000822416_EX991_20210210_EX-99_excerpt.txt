PulteGroup Announces Early Results of Cash Tender Offers  

Atlanta, Feb. 11, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) (“PulteGroup” or the “Company”) announced today the results to date of PulteGroup’s previously announced cash tender offers (the “Tender Offers”) to purchase up to $300 million aggregate principal amount (the “Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount”) of its outstanding 5.500% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and 5.000% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes” and, together with the 2026 Notes, the “Notes”), in the priorities set forth in the table below and subject to a maximum of $200 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes (the “2026 Tender Cap”) and a maximum of $100 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes (the “2027 Tender Cap” and together with the 2026 Tender Cap, the “Tender Caps”).  

Based on information provided by Global Bondholder Services, Inc., the tender agent for the Tender Offers, approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of Notes were validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 10, 2021 (the “Early Tender Time”). The following table sets forth the approximate aggregate principal amounts of each series of Notes that were validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) as of the Early Tender Time and the principal amounts that, subject to satisfaction of the conditions to the Tender Offers described below, are expected to be accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  

As of January 28, 2021.  

 (2)  

Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest from and including the applicable last interest payment with respect to the Notes accepted for purchase to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date (as defined below).  

 (3)  

Includes the Early Tender Premium (as defined below).  

 (4)  

The final proration factor has been rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point for presentation purposes.  

The principal amount of each series of Notes expected to be accepted for purchase was determined pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated January 28, 2021 (the “Offer to Purchase”). Subject to satisfaction of the conditions to the Tender Offers set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Company expects to accept and pay for Notes tendered prior to the Early Tender Time, subject to proration described herein, on or about February 12, 2021 (the “Early Settlement Date”).   

Holders of Notes that have been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) by the Early Tender Time and accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration set forth in the table above, which includes an early tender premium of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes accepted for purchase (the “Early Tender Premium”). In addition to the Total Consideration, all holders of Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) by the Early Tender Time and accepted for purchase will receive accrued and unpaid interest from and including the last interest payment date applicable to the relevant series of Notes up to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date. The deadline for holders to validly withdraw tenders of Notes has passed. Accordingly, tendered Notes may no longer be withdrawn or revoked, except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal or revocation rights are required by law.  

Because holders of Notes subject to the Tender Offers validly tendered and did not validly withdraw Notes at or before the Early Tender Time in an amount that exceeds the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount and, with respect to each series of the Notes, the Tender Cap applicable to such series, the Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at or prior to the Early Tender Time are expected to be accepted on a pro rata basis within each series, subject to a proration factor of approximately 53.98% with respect to the 2026 Notes and 48.85% with respect to the 2027 Notes. Consequently, although, the Tender Offers are scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, at the end of February 25, 2021, the Company does not expect to accept for purchase any tenders of Notes after the Early Tender Time.  

The Tender Offers are subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the Offer to Purchase. Such conditions may be waived by the Company in its sole discretion, subject to applicable law. Any waiver of a condition by the Company will not constitute a waiver of any other condition.  

The dealer manager for the Tender Offers is Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Any questions regarding the terms of the Tender Offers should be directed to the Dealer Manager, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at (toll-free) (800) 558-3745 or (collect) (212) 723-6106. The information agent and tender agent is Global Bondholder Services, Inc. Any questions regarding procedures for tendering Notes or requests for copies of the Offer to Purchase or other documents relating to the Tender Offers should be directed to the information agent for the Tender Offers, Global Bondholder Services, Inc., (866) 470-4300 (toll-free) or (212) 430-3774.

No offer, solicitation, purchase or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful. The offer is being made solely pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase.
