Introductory Note 

Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” “the company” or “Digital Realty” refer to Digital Realty Trust, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Digital Realty Trust, L.P., our “operating partnership.” 

Item 8.01. 

Other Events. 

On January 5, 2021, Digital Intrepid Holding B.V., an indirect wholly owned holding and finance subsidiary of the operating partnership, commenced an offering of Euro-denominated Guaranteed Notes (the “Euro Notes”). The Euro Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and the operating partnership. Consummation of the offering is subject to market and other conditions. The Euro Notes will be offered only outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Euro Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to United States persons (within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act) absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The final terms of the Euro Notes will be determined at the time of pricing. 

The company intends to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Euro Notes to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, recently completed or future green building, energy and resource efficiency and renewable energy projects, including the development and redevelopment of such projects (collectively, “Eligible Green Projects”). Pending the allocation of the net proceeds of the Euro Notes to Eligible Green Projects, all or a portion of an amount equal to the net proceeds from the Euro Notes may be used to temporarily repay borrowings outstanding under the operating partnership’s global revolving credit facilities, acquire additional properties or businesses, fund development opportunities, invest in interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing securities which are consistent with Digital Realty Trust, Inc.’s intention to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and to provide for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including potentially for the repayment of other debt, or the redemption, repurchase, repayment or retirement of outstanding equity or debt securities, or a combination of the foregoing. 

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Current Report on Form 

8-K contains certain “forward-looking” statements as that term is defined by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Statements that are predictive in nature, that depend on or relate to future events or conditions, or that include words such as “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “should”, “estimates”, “could”, “intends”, “plans” or other similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the company’s actual results in future periods to differ materially from those projected or contemplated in the forward-looking statements as a result of, but not limited to, the following factors: timing and consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes; the intended use of the net proceeds from the offering of the Euro Notes; risks and uncertainties related to market conditions and satisfaction of customary closing conditions related to the offering of the Euro Notes; and the impact of legislative, regulatory and competitive changes and other risk factors relating to the industries in which we operate, as detailed from time to time in each of our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that the proposed transactions will be consummated on the terms described herein or at all. 

The risks included here are not exhaustive, and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance. We discussed a number of additional material risks in our annual report on Form 

10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, our quarterly reports on Form 

10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020 and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those risks continue to be relevant to our performance and financial condition. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on the business or the extent to which any 

factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
