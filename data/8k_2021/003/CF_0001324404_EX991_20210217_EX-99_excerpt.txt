Operations Overview

CF Industries' operations are designated as part of the “critical infrastructure” in each country in which it operates and the Company continues to manage and respond actively to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, CF Industries has relied on its safety culture and a wide range of measures put in place across its network to limit potential exposure to the virus at its locations and enable continued safe production and distribution of products. As a result, there has been no known spread of the virus at the Company’s locations, positive COVID-19 tests among its employee population have not affected the Company’s ability to maintain safe staffing levels and operations have not been disrupted. 

The Company continues to operate safely and efficiently. As of December 31, 2020, the 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0.14 incidents per 200,000 work hours, the lowest level ever recorded by the Company and significantly better than industry benchmarks. 

Gross ammonia production for the full year of 2020 was 10.4 million tons, and for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 2.7 million tons, both company records. CF Industries expects gross ammonia production in 2021 to be in a range of 9.5-10.0 million tons due to a higher number of planned maintenance activities than in 2020. 

Full Year 2020 Financial Results Overview

For the full year of 2020, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $317 million, or $1.47 per diluted share; EBITDA was $1,316 million; and adjusted EBITDA was $1,350 million. These results compare to full year of 2019 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $493 million, or $2.23 per diluted share; EBITDA of $1,620 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $1,610 million. 

Net sales in the full year of 2020 were $4.1 billion compared to $4.6 billion in the full year of 2019. Average selling prices for the full year of 2020 were lower than the full year of 2019 across all segments due to increased global supply availability as lower global energy costs drove higher global operating rates. Sales volumes in the full year of 2020 were 20.3 million product tons compared to 19.5 million product tons in the full year of 2019 due to greater supply availability from higher starting inventories and higher production compared to the prior year. The Company expects sales volumes to return to a range of 19-19.5 million product tons in 2021 due to lower year-end inventory than the year before and lower expected production due to a higher number of planned maintenance activities than in 2020. 

Cost of sales for the full year of 2020 was lower than the full year of 2019 due to lower realized natural gas costs, partially offset by the impact of higher sales volumes. 

In the full year of 2020, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the Company’s cost of sales was $2.24 per MMBtu compared to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $2.74 per MMBtu in the full year of 2019. 

Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial Results Overview

For the fourth quarter of 2020, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $87 million, or $0.40 per diluted share; EBITDA was $334 million; and adjusted EBITDA was $338 million. These results compare to fourth quarter 2019 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $55 million, or $0.25 per diluted share; EBITDA of $306 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $325 million. 

Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $1.1 billion compared to $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Average selling prices for the fourth quarter of 2020 were lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 across most segments due to increased global supply availability as lower global energy costs drove higher global operating rates leading into the fourth quarter of 2020. Sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2020 were higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to greater supply availability. 

Cost of sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 was higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 due primarily to the impact of higher sales volumes and higher realized natural gas costs. 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the Company’s cost of sales was $2.60 per MMBtu compared to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $2.36 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Capital Management

Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 were $103 million and $309 million, respectively. The Company projects capital expenditures for full year 2021 will be in the range of $450 million, which reflects a return to a normal maintenance schedule and which includes investments in the company’s strategic initiatives related to the clean energy economy. 

The Company did not repurchase shares during the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year 2020, the Company repurchased 2.6 million shares for $100 million. Since the current share repurchase authorization was announced in February 2019, the Company has repurchased approximately 10.2 million shares for $437 million.

The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary CF Industries, Inc. has elected to redeem in full the entire outstanding $250 million principal amount of its 3.400% Senior Secured Notes due December 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) on March 20, 2021, in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes. Based on market interest rates on February 12, 2021, the company estimates that the total amount for the redemption of the 2021 Notes will be approximately $258 million, including accrued interest.

CHS Inc. Distribution

On January 31, 2021, the Board of Managers of CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) approved a semi-annual distribution payment to CHS Inc. (CHS) of $64 million for the distribution period ended December 31, 2020. The distribution was paid on February 1, 2021. Total distributions to CHS pertaining to 2020 were approximately $150 million.

Nitrogen Market Outlook

The global nitrogen pricing outlook for 2021 is significantly more positive compared to 2020, underpinned by higher commodity crop futures prices and substantially higher energy prices in Asia and Europe. These dynamics have driven strong global nitrogen demand and lower global nitrogen operating rates at the start of the year, tightening the global nitrogen market. As a result, the price per ton of a granular urea barge at New Orleans at the beginning of February 2021 was approximately 40 percent higher than the beginning of December 2020 and 60 percent higher than at the same point a year ago.

Global commodity crop near-term and futures prices have risen to their highest levels since 2014. Corn prices have increased significantly as lower yields in North America in 2020, poor growing weather in South America and strong demand for corn from China have resulted in the U.S. Department of Agriculture projecting the corn stocks to use ratio for marketing year 2020/21 at 10.6% in January 2021, its lowest level since 2013. These factors, along with U.S. government support for the agriculture industry, have resulted in strengthened farm economics and greater resources available to crop producers for 2021 crop inputs.

The Company projects that nitrogen-consuming coarse grain acres in North America will stay at or above 2020 levels despite an expected significant increase in soybean plantings as high crop prices and reduced prevent plant acreage in 2021 will result in higher overall planted acres in the year. The Company projects approximately 90-92 million planted corn acres in the United States in 2021. Demand for nitrogen should also be supported by higher canola plantings in Canada. Additionally, the Company expects demand in the region for industrial uses of nitrogen will rise with economic activity should the COVID-19 pandemic be brought under control through widespread vaccination.

Global nitrogen requirements are expected to remain robust throughout the year, driven by continued strong demand for urea imports from India and Brazil. Favorable weather in India has supported record urea tender volumes in 2019 and 2020. The Company projects urea tender volumes in India in 2021 to ease from record highs, but to be well above the five-year average of 6.5-7.0 million metric tons. The Company also believes that improved farm incomes and no active domestic urea production in Brazil will support demand for approximately 6.5 million metric tons of urea in 2021, similar to 2020. 

In addition to strong global nitrogen demand, global nitrogen pricing has been supported by lower nitrogen supply availability entering 2021. Higher natural gas prices in Asia and Europe have significantly reduced margins for nitrogen producers in these regions compared to the industry’s marginal producer, which remains Chinese anthracite coal-based complexes. This has resulted in lower operating rates in Europe and Asia. Additionally, Chinese producers have reported lower operating rates due to higher costs for coal, increased environmental inspections and natural gas being diverted to meet heating needs.

 3 

Natural gas energy spreads between North America and Europe/Asia widened significantly at the end of 2020 into 2021. From July 2020 to December 2020, the Dutch TTF natural gas price and the Asian JKM liquefied natural gas price both increased approximately five times greater than the U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price. These wider spreads have steepened the global nitrogen cost curve, increasing margin opportunities for North American producers. Forward curves suggest that these energy spreads will persist throughout 2021. 

Clean Energy Strategy Update

The Company continues to advance its plans to support the global hydrogen and clean fuel economy, which is expected to grow significantly over the next decade. Key initiatives in development include a green ammonia project at the Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex and carbon dioxide sequestration and other carbon abatement projects across the Company's network to enable low-carbon ammonia production. 

Green hydrogen and ammonia are expected to be critical contributors to the world achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Clean hydrogen demand is expected to grow exponentially, with industry experts projecting that hydrogen will meet approximately 20% of the world’s energy need by 2050, up from less than 1% today. Because ammonia is a highly efficient transport and storage mechanism for hydrogen as well as a fuel in its own right, demand for green and low-carbon ammonia is expected to increase significantly along with demand for clean hydrogen. As the world’s largest ammonia producer, the Company believes that its ammonia production and distribution network, along with its storage and transportation capabilities and technical expertise, is uniquely positioned to meet the anticipated demand for hydrogen and ammonia from green and low-carbon sources.
