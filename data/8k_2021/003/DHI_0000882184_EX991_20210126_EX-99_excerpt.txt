The Company's return on equity (ROE) was 24.4% for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and homebuilding return on inventory (ROI) was 28.0% for the same period.

Homebuilding debt at December 31, 2020 totaled $2.6 billion. The Company’s homebuilding debt to total capital ratio at December 31, 2020 was 17.3%. Homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus homebuilding notes payable.

Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, “The D.R.

Our pre-tax profit margin for the quarter improved 440 basis points to 17.4%, while our earnings increased 84% to $2.14 per diluted share. These results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands.

“We appreciate the continued efforts of our operational teams who are providing new homes to families across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, customers, trade partners and the communities we serve.

“Housing market conditions remain very strong, and we are focused on maximizing returns and improving capital efficiency in each of our communities while increasing our market share. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions, and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company and returns to our shareholders.”

Multi-Family Rental Operations

At December 31, 2020, the Company’s multi-family rental operations had four projects under active construction and four projects that were substantially complete and in the lease-up phase. These eight projects represent 2,325 multi-family units. There were no sales of multi-family rental properties during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.

Single-Family Rental Operations

During fiscal 2020, the Company began constructing and leasing homes as single-family rental communities. After these rental communities are constructed and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy, the Company generally expects to market each community for a bulk sale of homes. These operations are reported in the homebuilding segment.

The Company repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock for $69.8 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company’s remaining stock repurchase authorization at December 31, 2020 was $465.5 million.

COVID-19 

During March 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (C-19) and the related widespread reductions in economic activity across the United States began to adversely affect the Company’s business. However, residential construction and financial services are designated as essential businesses as part of critical infrastructure in almost all of the municipalities across the U.S. where the Company operates. The Company implemented operational protocols to comply with social distancing and other health and safety guidelines as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities.

The Company remains cautious as to the ongoing impact C-19 and other external factors may have on the economy and its operations. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long C-19 and its related effects will impact the U.S. economy and level of employment, capital markets, secondary mortgage markets, consumer confidence, demand for the Company’s homes and availability and cost of mortgage loans to homebuyers. The extent to which this impacts the Company’s operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of C-19 and the impact on D.R. Horton’s customers, trade partners and employees, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
