FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

HALLIBURTON ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER 2020 RESULTS

•Reported net loss of $0.27 per diluted share

•Adjusted net income of $0.18 per diluted share, excluding impairments and other charges

•Cash flow from operating activities of $638 million and free cash flow of $420 million

HOUSTON - January 19, 2021 - Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) announced today a net loss of $235 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2020. This compares to a net loss for the third quarter of 2020 of $17 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2020, excluding impairments and other charges, was $160 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2020, excluding severance and other charges, of $100 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. Halliburton's total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $3.2 billion, a 9% increase from revenue of $3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2020. Reported operating loss was $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to reported operating income of $142 million in the third quarter of 2020. Excluding impairments and other charges, adjusted operating income was $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 27% increase from adjusted operating income of $275 million in the third quarter of 2020. 

Total revenue for the full year of 2020 was $14.4 billion, a decrease of $8.0 billion, or 36% from 2019. Reported operating loss for 2020 was $2.4 billion, compared to reported operating loss of $448 million for 2019. Excluding impairments and other charges, adjusted operating income for 2020 was $1.4 billion, compared to adjusted operating income of $2.1 billion for 2019.

“I am pleased with our solid execution in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our swift and decisive cost actions and service delivery improvements reset our earnings power, delivering strong margins and cash flow. We also achieved historic bests in safety and service quality,” commented Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO.

“I am optimistic about the activity momentum I see in North America, and expect international activity to bottom in the first quarter of this year. I am also encouraged by the growing pipeline of international customer opportunities and the unfolding global activity recovery. 

“I believe our strategic priorities will allow us to continue generating industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow and solidify Halliburton’s role in the unfolding energy market recovery,” concluded Miller.

Operating Segments

Completion and Production

Completion and Production revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.8 billion, an increase of $236 million, or 15%, when compared to the third quarter of 2020, while operating income was $282 million, an increase of $70 million, or 33%. These increases were driven by higher activity across multiple product lines in North America, increased stimulation activity in Argentina and Kuwait, higher completion tools sales in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Norway, and increased well intervention services internationally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping activity in Saudi Arabia and lower completion tools sales in Eurasia and Australia. 

Drilling and Evaluation

Drilling and Evaluation revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.4 billion, an increase of $26 million, or 2%, when compared to the third quarter of 2020, while operating income was $117 million, an increase of $12 million, or 11%. These increases were primarily due to higher drilling-related services in North America and Brazil, increased wireline activity in North America and Latin America, higher fluids sales in Asia Pacific and Guyana, and increased software sales across all regions. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services and project management activity across Europe/Africa/CIS, the Middle East, and Mexico, as well as reduced wireline activity in Asia Pacific and Saudi Arabia. 

Geographic Regions 

North America

North America revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.2 billion, a 26% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by higher activity in stimulation and artificial lift in U.S. land, as well as higher well construction and wireline services activity, and year-end completion tools and software sales.

International

International revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $2.0 billion, essentially flat when compared to the third quarter of 2020. Higher pressure pumping and wireline activity in Argentina, increased fluids sales in Asia Pacific and Guyana, higher completion tools sales in Norway, Africa, and Southeast Asia, and increased software sales across multiple regions were offset by lower activity across multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Norway, and Russia.

Latin America revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $426 million, a 12% increase sequentially, resulting primarily from increased pressure pumping and wireline activity in Argentina, and activity increases in multiple product service lines in Colombia and Ecuador, as well as higher fluids sales in Guyana and drilling services in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico.

Europe/Africa/CIS revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $642 million, a 1% decrease sequentially, resulting primarily from reduced drilling-related services and completion tools sales in Eurasia, coupled with lower drilling-related activity in Norway. These decreases were partially offset by higher completion tools sales in Africa, Norway, and Continental Europe, as well as increased stimulation and well intervention services in Algeria and Continental Europe.

Middle East/Asia revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $931 million, a 3% decrease sequentially, largely resulting from lower activity across multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, reduced drilling activity in the United Arab Emirates, and decreased project management activity in India. These decreases were partially offset by higher drilling-related services in China, Australia and Malaysia, increased stimulation activity in Kuwait, and higher software sales across the region.

Other Financial Items

Halliburton recognized $446 million of pre-tax impairments and other charges in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily related to a contemplated structured transaction for its North American real estate assets.
