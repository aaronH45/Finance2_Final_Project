In 2020, Charter added 1.8 million residential customer relationships versus 1.0 million added in 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2020, Charter's residential customer relationships grew by 167,000, while fourth quarter 2019 residential customer relationships increased by 240,000. 

Charter added 2.1 million residential Internet customers in 2020, versus 1.3 million added in 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2020, Charter added 216,000 residential Internet customers versus fourth quarter 2019 net additions of 313,000, which is a function of lower sales activity caused by adding 1.9 million residential Internet customers in the prior three quarters as well as lower market churn, resulting in fewer selling opportunities in the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2020, over 85% of residential Internet customers subscribed to tiers that provided 100 Mbps or more of speed, and over 50% subscribed to tiers that provided 200 Mbps or more of speed. During the fourth quarter, Charter doubled its starting download speed to 200 Mbps in 17 markets. Currently, 200 Mbps is the slowest speed offered to new Spectrum Internet® customers in nearly 75% of Charter's footprint, with 100 Mbps the slowest speed offered in the remainder of its footprint. Charter also offers Spectrum Internet Gig (940 Mbps) across its entire footprint. Additionally, Charter's Advanced In-Home WiFi service, which provides customers the ability to optimize their home networks while providing greater control of their connected devices, has now been launched across more than 65% of Charter's footprint for new Internet connects.

Charter added 19,000 residential video customers in 2020, compared to a decline of 484,000 in 2019. Residential video customers decreased by 66,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020, while fourth quarter 2019 residential video customers decreased by 105,000.

In 2020, Charter's residential wireline voice customers declined by 228,000 versus a decline of 692,000 in 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2020, residential wireline voice customers declined by 120,000, while fourth quarter 2019 residential wireline voice customers declined by 152,000. 

Fourth quarter 2020 residential revenue per residential customer (excluding mobile) totaled $111.85, and declined by 1.7% compared to the prior year period, given a higher percentage of non-video customers, a higher mix of lower priced video packages within Charter's video customer base and lower installation revenue, partly offset by promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments. 

Charter added 93,000 SMB customer relationships in 2020, compared to 125,000 added in 2019. SMB customer relationships grew by 30,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020, while fourth quarter 2019 SMB customer relationships grew by 28,000. Enterprise PSUs grew by 7,000 in 2020 versus 19,000 added in 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2020, enterprise PSUs grew by 2,000, compared to growth of 3,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

In 2020, Charter added 1.3 million mobile lines versus 948,000 added in 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2020, Charter added 315,000 mobile lines, compared to 288,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Spectrum MobileTM is available to all new and existing Spectrum Internet customers and runs on America's most awarded LTE network combined with Spectrum WiFi.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

Fourth quarter revenue increased by 7.3% year-over-year to $12.6 billion, driven by growth in Internet, mobile and advertising. Excluding advertising revenue, which benefited from political spend in the fourth quarter of 2020, revenue grew by 5.9% year-over-year.

Internet revenue grew by 11.9% year-over-year to $4.9 billion, driven by growth in Internet customers during the last year, promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments.

Video revenue totaled $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 1.2% compared to the prior year period, driven by a higher mix of lower priced video packages within Charter's video customer base and lower installation revenue, partly offset by promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments.

 Voice revenue totaled $449 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 0.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by a decline in wireline voice customers over the last twelve months.

Residential revenue totaled $9.7 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 5.0% year-over-year.

Commercial revenue increased by 1.0% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, driven by SMB and enterprise revenue growth of 1.1% and 0.9% year-over-year, respectively. SMB revenue growth was partly reduced by COVID-19 related seasonal plans. Enterprise revenue growth was impacted by lower cell tower

backhaul and other wholesale revenue. Enterprise retail revenue excluding wholesale revenue increased by 5.4% year-over-year, reflecting PSU growth.

Fourth quarter advertising sales revenue of $625 million increased by 43.9% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by higher political revenue and advanced advertising, partly offset by lower local sales. Excluding political revenue in both periods, advertising sales revenue declined by 4.6% year-over-year driven by COVID-19 effects. 

Fourth quarter mobile revenue totaled $428 million, an increase of 80.9% year-over-year. 

Other revenue totaled $222 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.5% year-over-year.

Operating Costs and Expenses

Fourth quarter total operating costs and expenses increased by $398 million, or 5.5% year-over-year. 

Fourth quarter programming costs increased by $101 million, or 3.6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting contractual programming increases and renewals, partly offset by a higher mix of lower cost video packages within Charter's video customer base.

Regulatory, connectivity and produced content expenses decreased by $64 million, or 10.7% year-over-year, primarily driven by the deferral of sports rights costs to 2021 due to a delayed start of the NBA season.

Costs to service customers increased by $80 million, or 4.4% year-over-year, despite year-over-year residential and SMB customer growth of 6.5%. The year-over-year increase in costs to service customers was primarily driven by previously announced accelerated wage benefits for hourly field operations and call center employees and higher COVID-19 related benefits, partly offset by lower bad debt and productivity improvements.

Marketing expenses increased by $10 million, or 1.4% year-over-year.

Other expenses increased by $121 million, or 13.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 primarily driven by a one-time corporate cost and higher advertising sales expense. 

Fourth quarter mobile costs totaled $522 million, an increase of 40.5% year-over-year, and were comprised of device costs, customer acquisition costs, and service and operating costs.

Adjusted EBITDA

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $5.0 billion grew by 10.2% year-over-year, reflecting growth in revenue and operating expenses of 7.3% and 5.5%, respectively. 

Net Income Attributable to Charter Shareholders

Net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $714 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase in net income attributable to Charter shareholders was primarily driven by higher Adjusted EBITDA, a pension remeasurement gain in the current year period versus a loss in the prior year period and a non-cash gain on financial instruments, partly offset by higher tax expense.

6

Net income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $6.33 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $3.36 during the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of the factors described above in addition to a 7.4% decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding versus the prior year period.

Capital Expenditures

Property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $2.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by declines in scalable infrastructure and support spending. The year-over-year decrease in scalable infrastructure spending was primarily due to timing of core network enhancements, partly offset by higher node splits given growing customer relationships and traffic. The decrease in support capital was driven by lower spend on back office systems, partly offset by facility improvements. Fourth quarter capital expenditures included $157 million of mobile costs, most of which are included in support capital.

Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow

During the fourth quarter of 2020, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $4.1 billion, compared to $3.4 billion in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to higher Adjusted EBITDA and a favorable change in trade working capital.

Free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $2.1 billion, compared to $1.6 billion during the same period last year. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow was driven by an increase in net cash flows from operating activities.

Liquidity & Financing

As of December 31, 2020, total principal amount of debt was $82.1 billion and Charter's credit facilities provided approximately $4.7 billion of additional liquidity in excess of Charter's $1.0 billion cash position.

In October 2020, CCO Holdings, LLC ("CCO Holdings") and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. jointly issued an additional $1.5 billion of its 4.500% senior unsecured notes due 2032 at a price of 103.750%. The net proceeds were used to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes, including repaying certain indebtedness, including repayment of $750 million of CCO Holdings' 5.375% senior notes due May 1, 2025, as well as funding potential buybacks of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units.

In December 2020, Charter Communications Operating, LLC and Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp. jointly issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.300% senior secured notes due 2032 at a price of 99.786%, an additional $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.700% senior secured notes due 2051 at a price of 100.791% and $1.35 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.850% senior secured notes due 2061 at a price of 99.882%. The net proceeds were used to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes, including funding buybacks of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units as well as repaying certain indebtedness, including $700 million of Time Warner Cable, LLC 4.125% notes due February 2021.

Revenues

For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues increased to $48.1 billion, 5.1% higher than in 2019, driven by growth in Internet, mobile and advertising. Excluding advertising revenue, which benefited from political spend in 2020, revenue grew by 5.0% year-over-year.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA totaled $18.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 9.9% compared to 2019, reflecting growth in revenue and operating expenses of 5.1% and 2.3%, respectively.

Net Income Attributable to Charter Shareholders

Net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.7 billion in 2019. The year-over-year increase in net income attributable to Charter shareholders was primarily driven by higher Adjusted EBITDA, partly offset by higher tax expense.

Net income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $15.85 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $7.60 during the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of the factors described above in addition to a 7.4% decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding versus the prior year period.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures totaled $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $7.2 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increases in line extensions, Internet CPE, support capital and scalable infrastructure. For the full year 2020, mobile capital expenditures totaled $508 million versus $432 million for the full year 2019.

Charter currently expects 2021 cable capital expenditures to be relatively consistent or lower as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020.

Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow

For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $14.6 billion, compared to $11.7 billion in 2019. The year-over-year increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to higher Adjusted EBITDA and a favorable change in working capital in 2020 relative to the change in working capital in 2019. The increase in cash flows resulting from changes in working capital was favorably impacted by one-time unfavorable impacts in 2019 from bill cycle standardization efforts as well as one-time net favorable impacts in 2020 related to COVID-19, including deferral of payroll tax payments.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7.1 billion, compared to $4.6 billion during the same period last year. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow was driven by an increase in net cash flows from operating activities, partly offset by higher capital expenditures.

Share Repurchases

For the year ended December 31, 2020, Charter purchased approximately 21.1 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units for approximately $12.1 billion.

Additional Information Available on Website

The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which will be posted on the “Results & SEC Filings” section of our investor relations website at ir.charter.com, when it is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). A slide presentation to accompany the conference call and a trending schedule containing historical customer and financial data will also be available in the “Results & SEC Filings” section.

Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Information

The company uses certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to evaluate various aspects of its business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income attributable to Charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to net income attributable to Charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, in the Addendum to this release.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Charter shareholders plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, net, other pension (benefits) costs, net, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, net, such as special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of the Company's businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by the Company's capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and the cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures. 

Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures. 

Management and Charter's board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to assess Charter's performance and its ability to service its debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio 

10

calculation under the Company's credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by its operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. The Company's debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which were $384 million and $301 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
