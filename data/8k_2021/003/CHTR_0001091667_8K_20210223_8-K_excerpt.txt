ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS. 

On February 23, 2021, Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”) and Liberty Broadband Corporation (“LBB”) entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”). The Letter Agreement implements LBB’s obligations under the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement by and among Charter Communications, Inc., Charter (formerly known as CCH I, LLC), LBB and Advance/Newhouse Partnership (“Advance”), dated as of May 23, 2015 (as amended, the “Stockholders Agreement”) to participate in share repurchases by Charter to the extent necessary so that LBB’s ownership of Charter does not exceed the LBB Cap (as defined below).

Under the Letter Agreement, the applicable Liberty Party (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) will sell to Charter, generally on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter’s Class A common stock (“Class A Common Stock”) representing an amount sufficient for LBB’s ownership of Charter to be reduced such that it does not  exceed the ownership cap then applicable to LBB under the Stockholders Agreement (the “LBB Cap”) as Charter reduces outstanding shares through repurchases from time to time. At the time of each monthly purchase of Class A Common Stock from LBB under the Letter Agreement, Charter will pay the applicable Liberty Party (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) a purchase price per share equal to the volume weighted average price per share paid by Charter for shares repurchased during such immediately preceding calendar month other than (i) purchases from Advance, (ii) purchases in privately negotiated transactions or (iii) purchases for the withholding of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to equity compensation programs of Charter. The Letter Agreement terminates upon the earliest of (i) mutual written agreement of the parties, (ii) the termination of the Stockholders Agreement as to Charter or LBB in accordance with its terms and (iii) 12:01 a.m. following the first end date of a repurchase period occurring at least ten days after either party, in its sole discretion, delivers a written termination notice to the other party (provided, that, in the case of clause (iii), the rights and obligations of the parties under the Letter Agreement survive with respect to a repurchase period ending prior to such termination), and, upon any termination, the requirement of LBB to sell shares of Class A Common Stock to Charter to the extent necessary so that LBB’s ownership of Charter does not exceed the LBB Cap would revert to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement.

A copy of the Letter Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Letter Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that document.
