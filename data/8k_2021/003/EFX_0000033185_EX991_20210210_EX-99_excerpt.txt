ATLANTA, February 10, 2021 -- Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2020. 

“Equifax delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth and margin expansion, concluding a record year in which we delivered over $4 billion in revenue for the first time. Workforce Solutions and U.S. Information Services outperformance fueled our 23% revenue growth in the fourth quarter by leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities, new product roll-outs, new data assets, and customer growth,” said Mark W. Begor, Equifax Chief Executive Officer. “We are entering a new chapter at Equifax as we leverage our expanding cloud native data, analytics and technology infrastructure to accelerate innovation, new products and growth. Our strong performance in these challenging times reflects the strength and resiliency of our business model as we look to build upon our momentum and focus on growth in 2021 and beyond. We are increasing our focus on acquisitions that will accelerate our growth including our acquisition of Kount in Identity and Fraud. Based on our confidence in the future we plan to restart our share repurchase program at an expected level over $100 million in 2021, to offset dilution from employee benefit plans.”

Financial Results Summary

The Company reported revenue of $1,118.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 23 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2019 on both a reported and local currency basis. 

Fourth quarter 2020 diluted EPS attributable to Equifax was $0.61 per share, up from $0.13 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Common Questions & Answers (Unaudited)

(Dollars in millions)

1. Can you provide a further analysis of operating revenue for the fourth quarter and adjusted revenue for the full year by operating segment?

Operating and adjusted revenue consists of the following components:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Reflects percentage change in revenue conforming 2020 results using 2019 exchange rates.

**Adjusted revenue is defined as GAAP revenue adjusted for a charge related to settlements with commercial customers in the third quarter of 2019. See Non-GAAP reconciliation D for a reconciliation of operating revenue to adjusted revenue.

2. What is the breakdown of costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident?

Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident are defined as incremental costs to transform our information technology infrastructure and data security; legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal, government and regulatory claims; as well as costs to provide free product and related support to the consumer.

10

We recorded $112.6 million ($82.3 million, net of tax) and $181.6 million ($147.0 million, net of tax) for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively, for costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. We recorded $365.0 million ($270.5 million, net of tax) and $1,138.2 million ($938.4 million, net of tax) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for costs associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident. The components of the costs are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The $111.5 million and $358.5 million of technology and data security costs include incremental costs to transform our technology infrastructure and improve application, network, and data security. These include, but are not limited to, costs for people, professional and contracted services, technical services and products, and other costs added either directly or indirectly to manage, execute, and support the implementation of these plans. The $1.1 million and $6.5 million of legal and investigative fees include legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal, government, and regulatory investigations and claims related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident.

3. What is the impact of the pension accounting change?

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we voluntarily changed our method of accounting for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Under the accounting method change, remeasurement of projected benefit obligation and plan assets are immediately recognized in earnings through net periodic benefit cost within Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), with pension and postretirement plans to be remeasured annually in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events require remeasurement. In addition, we changed our accounting for measuring the market-related value of plan assets from a calculated amount to fair value, no longer recognizing the difference between expected return on assets and actual return on assets over a five year period. Prior to this accounting method change, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses were included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and were amortized into earnings over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. We also determined the market-related value of plan assets based on a calculated market adjustment to reflect investment gains and losses during each of the last five years, with differences between expected and actual return on plan assets recognized at a rate of 20% per year. While the historical accounting principle was acceptable, we believe that the current accounting policies provide a better representation of the operating results of the Company and the economic performance of plan assets in relation to the measurement of its benefit obligations for the period. The changes in accounting will more clearly reflect the current period impact of the Company’s pension asset investment strategy to readers of the financial statements. 

This accounting change has been applied on a retrospective basis for all prior years presented. Due to the nature of the accounting change, it has impacted both our GAAP and adjusted results. The following tables reflect the effects of the change in accounting method on amounts previously reported in prior periods: 

11

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* For updated non-GAAP reconciliations, see the Investor Relations page at www.investor.equifax.com

** Per share amounts may not equal totals due to rounding

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the pension accounting change resulted in a $9.2 million ($6.9 million, net of tax) decrease to Other Income (Expense). The $9.2 million ($6.9 million, net of tax) decrease in Other Income (Expense) consists of the $32.2 million loss ($24.3 million, net of tax) related to the mark-to-market fair value adjustment of our pension and postretirement benefit plans, partially offset by a $23.0 million ($17.4 million, net of tax) increase in Other Income (Expense) due to the impact of the accounting change on the calculation of pension expense.

Additional information around the impact of the pension accounting change will be included within our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

(1)During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $36.0 million ($30.5 million, net of tax). We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $35.3 million ($30.0 million net of tax). The $5.3 million of tax is comprised of $9.3 million of tax expense net of $4.0 million of a cash income tax benefit. 

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $141.8 million ($120.6 million net of tax).

(13)Argentina experienced multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates. As such, Argentina was deemed a highly inflationary economy by accounting policymakers in 2018.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures

Acquisition-related amortization expense, net of tax - During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $36.0 million ($30.5 million, net of tax). For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $141.8 million ($120.6 million net of tax)

We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the material cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in material cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax. Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital.

Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident - During the fourth quarter of 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded pre-tax expenses of $112.6 million ($82.3 million, net of tax) and $365.0 million ($270.5 million, net of tax), respectively, and during the fourth quarter of 2019 and for year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded pre-tax expenses of $82.0 million ($63.5 million, net of tax) and $337.3 million ($252.3 million, net of tax), respectively, associated with the costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident, legal fees to respond to subsequent litigation and government investigations, costs to deliver the free product offering made to all U.S. consumers and incremental costs to transform our information technology, data security, and infrastructure. Management believes excluding these charges is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident do not include losses accrued for certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident.

Accrual for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident - During the fourth quarter of 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded expenses, net of directors and officers insurance recoveries, of $99.6 million ($83.5 million, net of tax) and $800.9 million ($686.1 million, net of tax) for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, exclusive of our legal professional services expenses. Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for 2020, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Fair market value adjustment of equity investments - During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a $32.9 million ($26.3 million, net of tax) gain related to adjusting our equity method investment in India, in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining interest of our joint venture. Prior to the purchase of the remaining interest, Equifax did not have control over the joint venture. As a result of the transaction, Equifax recognized a gain related to the remeasurement of the preexisting equity interest in the India joint venture at the acquisition-date fair value of the business combination. 

In addition, during the third quarter of 2020, our investment in Brazil underwent an initial public offering. The investment had previously been recorded on our books at cost less impairment, as it did not have a readily determinable fair value. Subsequent to the initial public offering, our investment in Brazil has been adjusted to fair value, and will continue to be adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, with unrealized gains or losses to be recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other income, net. For the fourth quarter of 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $13.3 million ($11.0 million, net of tax) loss and a $116.6 million ($74.8 million, net of tax) gain, respectively, on the fair market value adjustment of our equity investment in Brazil. Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results, since the non-operating gains and losses are not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Pension mark-to-market fair value adjustment - Effective in the fourth quarter of 2020, we voluntarily changed our method of accounting for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Under the accounting method change, remeasurement of projected benefit obligation and 

22

plan assets are immediately recognized in earnings through net periodic benefit cost within Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), with pension and postretirement plans to be remeasured annually in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events require remeasurement. This change has been applied on a retrospective basis for all prior periods presented. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $32.2 million loss ($24.3 million, net of tax) related to the fourth quarter mark-to-market fair value adjustment of our pension and postretirement benefit plans. During the fourth quarter of 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $4.8 million gain ($3.9 million, net of tax) related to the fourth quarter mark-to-market fair value adjustment of our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results, since the non-operating gains and losses are not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Income tax effects of Q1 2020 gain on fair market value adjustment of equity investment - During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a gain related to adjusting our equity method investment in India, in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining interest of our joint venture. Prior to the purchase of the remaining interest, Equifax did not have control over the joint venture. As a result of the transaction, Equifax recognized a gain related to the remeasurement of the preexisting equity interest in the India joint venture at the acquisition-date fair value of the business combination. Additional income tax effects related to this transaction were recorded each quarter of 2020. Management believes excluding this gain and related income tax effects from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for 2020, since the non-operating gain is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans - During the fourth quarter of 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded foreign currency loss related to certain intercompany loans of $3.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively. The impact was recorded to the Other Income, net line item within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets - During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a $7.0 million valuation allowance adjustment for deferred tax assets where the benefit is not expected to be realized. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for 2020 because this amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Tax benefit on a legal settlement related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident - During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a $4.8 million tax benefit on legal settlements related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, as finalization of the settlement terms in the first quarter caused us to conclude the tax treatment has changed from the time we recorded the initial loss. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Settlements with commercial customers - During the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a $20.0 million ($15.1 million, net of tax) charge to revenue related to settlements with commercial customers. Management believes this adjustment to revenue provides meaningful information regarding our revenue and provides a basis to compare revenue between periods and to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. Management considers these adjustments when assessing historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Charge related to the realignment of internal resources and other costs - During the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2019, we recorded $31.9 million ($24.3 million, net of tax) and $11.5 million ($8.8 million, net of tax), respectively, of restructuring charges for the realignment of internal resources and other costs, which predominantly relates to the reduction of headcount and the realignment of our internal resources to support the Company’s strategic objectives and increase the integration of our global operations. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, since the charges are not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

23

Income tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting or settlement - During the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded tax benefit of $3.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively, related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. During the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a tax expense of $1.1 million and tax benefit of $3.0 million, respectively, related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the corresponding period in 2019, because this amount is non-operating and relates to income tax benefits or deficiencies for stock awards recognized when tax amounts differ from recognized stock compensation cost. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Argentina highly inflationary foreign currency adjustment - Argentina experienced multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates. As such, Argentina was deemed a highly inflationary economy by accounting policymakers in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.5 million, related to the impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of Argentina being a highly inflationary economy. During the fourth quarter of 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

PayNet acquisition related amounts for transaction expenses incurred as a direct result of the acquisition - During the second quarter of 2019, we recorded $6.3 million ($4.8 million, net of tax) for PayNet acquisition related amounts other than acquisition-related amortization which was primarily related to transaction costs resulting from the acquisition and was recorded in operating income. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results, since a charge of such amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods.

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin - Management defines adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income attributable to Equifax plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain one-time items. Management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.

Adjusted revenue - Management defines adjusted revenue as GAAP revenue adjusted for a non-recurring charge related to settlements with commercial customers. Management believes the use of adjusted revenue in this instance allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.
