KEY BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS:

•Grew organic revenues 3.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, with increases in RWCS of 1.9% and Secure Information Destruction (“SID”) of 7.4%. North America SID revenues grew 7.6% in the first full quarter since the ERP deployment. 

•Generated free cash flow of $186.2 million in 2021, with the fourth quarter of 2021 contributing $69.8 million.

•Continued to execute on our portfolio optimization initiative in the fourth quarter: 

◦Divested our Environmental Solutions business in Canada for proceeds of $24.4 million, our tenth divestiture since January 2019. 

◦Acquired a Midwest-based regulated waste business for total consideration of $43.4 million. 

“We delivered organic revenue growth every quarter in 2021, with 3.5% organic growth in the fourth quarter. We also made important progress executing across our key business priorities. We successfully operated on our ERP for North America Secure Information Destruction, which we deployed in the third quarter. We continued to optimize our overall portfolio with the divestiture of our Canadian Environmental Solutions business, our tenth divestiture, while completing our first Regulated Waste and Compliance Services acquisition in over three years,” said Cindy J. Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer. “As part of this accretive tuck-in acquisition, we are excited to welcome new customers and team members into our core business. Finally, we reduced our net debt by approximately $48.2 million through our free cash flow generation and divestiture proceeds.” 

FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS 

U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) Results

•Revenues in the fourth quarter were $657.3 million, compared to $655.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of divestitures of $20.5 million and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $0.9 million, organic revenues increased $22.8 million. Of the increase, SID organic revenue growth was $13.9 million and RWCS organic revenue growth was $8.9 million. 

•Income from operations in the fourth quarter was $8.2 million, compared to $93.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The $85.0 million decline was primarily due to the following:

◦Lower gains on divestitures of $30.0 million, 

◦Higher legal and self-insurance claim expenses of $24.1 million, mainly due to an additional $19.7 million we have accrued for the FCPA settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice, with whom we have reached an agreement in principle, 

◦Ongoing IT operating expenditures from our ERP system of $13.6 million, 

◦Higher supply chain and other inflationary costs of approximately $10.0 million, and 

◦Higher labor costs of approximately $7.0 million. 

•Net loss in the fourth quarter was $17.2 million, or $0.19 diluted loss per share, compared to net income of $48.5 million, or $0.53 diluted earnings per share, in the fourth quarter of last year. The difference was related to lower income from operations of $85.0 million, as explained above, which was partially offset by lower income tax expense of $15.5 million.

•Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $303.1 million, compared to $530.2 million in 2020. The year-over-year decline of $227.1 million was primarily driven by 2020 and 2021 non-recurring differences of $216.6 million as explained below.

•Cash paid for capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $116.9 million, compared to $119.5 million in 2020.

Non-GAAP Results

•For the fourth quarter of 2021, organic revenues grew 3.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, which excludes the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange rates. In the fourth quarter, organic revenues of RWCS increased 1.9% and SID increased 7.4%.

•Adjusted income from operations was $64.2 million, compared to $108.6 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted income from operations as a percent of revenues declined 680 basis points. The decline was primarily driven by ongoing IT operating expenditures from our ERP system of 210 basis points, higher supply chain and other inflationary costs of approximately 150 basis points, higher legal and self-insurance claim expenses of 150 basis points, and higher labor costs of 110 basis points.

•Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.38, compared to $0.59 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact from divestitures of $0.02, the remaining $0.19 year-over-year decline was driven by higher supply chain, labor and other inflationary costs of approximately $0.12, ongoing IT operating expenditures from our ERP system of $0.09, and higher legal and self-insurance claim expenses of $0.06. These impacts were partially offset by a lower income tax rate of $0.06 and lower interest expense and other of $0.02.

•Free Cash Flow for 2021 was $186.2 million, compared to $410.7 million for 2020. The year-over-year decline of $224.5 million was primarily driven by 2020 and 2021 non-recurring differences of $216.6 million and net working capital changes of $32.5 million, mainly driven by the timing of North America SID customer collections. These decreases were partially offset by tax refunds of $22.0 million and lower capital expenditures of $2.6 million. The non-recurring differences include:

◦U.S. CARES Act net operating loss carryback refunds of $110.0 million in 2020, 

◦Government-related payment deferrals in 2020 associated with pandemic-related relief and subsequent 2021 payments in aggregate of $48.8 million,

◦Annual incentive compensation payout of $38.6 million in 2021 versus a nominal payout in 2020, and

◦Advances received on a service agreement related to the divestiture of Domestic Environmental Solutions of $19.2 million in 2020.

(1)Organic growth is the change in Revenues which includes SOP (sorted office paper) pricing and volume and excludes the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange.

(2)The comparisons at constant currency rates (foreign exchange) reflect comparative local currency balances at prior period’s foreign exchange rates. Stericycle calculated these percentages by taking current period reported Revenues less the respective prior period reported Revenues, divided by the prior period reported Revenues, all at the respective prior period’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in Revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period. Management believes the use of this measure aids in the understanding of changes in Revenues without the impact of foreign currency.

(3)In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our service lines to include Communication Solutions (formally part of CRS) in RWCS. This reclassification was driven by the divestiture of the Company's global product recall business (Expert Solutions) in December of 2020 and the remaining Communication Solutions service line synergies with the Company's RWCS customers. For 2020 periods presented, amounts have been recast to reflect this change.

In 2021 and 2020, SG&A includes $2.1 million and $8.2 million, respectively, of primarily consulting and professional fees for certain litigation, settlement and regulatory compliance matters. 

(5) Asset Impairments: In 2021, SG&A includes charges of $4.6 million in International related to a non-cash impairment associated with certain customer relationship intangibles in Romania and $2.1 million in Canada related to a non-cash impairment associated with a site exit. In 2020, SG&A includes charges of $2.6 million in International primarily related to non-cash impairments associated with certain permits in the U.K. 

(6) Other: In 2020, SG&A includes $1.2 million of consulting and professional fees related to internal control remediation activities. 

(7) U.S. CARES Act and Other Tax Matters: In 2021, we recognized a $3.6 million tax charge related to an ongoing examination of pre-acquisition tax years of an acquired business. In 2020, we recognized a $5.0 million tax benefit related to the U.S. CARES Act associated with our ability to carryback net operating losses to prior years that had higher tax rates that was finalized in the process of completing the 2019 federal income tax return. 

(a) The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release are reconciled to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the schedules attached to this release. Management believes the Non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of Stericycle’s performance because they provide additional information about Stericycle’s operations and exclude certain adjusting items, allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release may not be calculated in the same manner as certain other Non-GAAP financial measures and are used solely to evaluate management’s performance for incentive compensation purposes. All Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to or calculated in the same manner as Non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies.

(b) Three months ended December 31, 2020 exclude depreciation charges of $0.3 million that are included in ERP Implementation..

(c) Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is Income from operations excluding certain adjusting items, depreciation and intangible amortization.

(d) Under the Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Common Shareholders column, adjustments are shown net of tax in aggregate of $4.1 million and $9.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, based on applying the statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the adjustment occurred or, by adjusting the tax effect to consider the impact of applying an annual effective tax rate on an interim basis. For purposes of reconciling adjusted diluted earnings per share with respect to taxes period-over-period, the company utilizes a “rate approach” to highlight the impact of the adjusted tax rate. It is computed by multiplying the prior period adjusted rate by the current period adjusted income before taxes to determine the expected tax expense. Such expected tax expense is then compared to actual tax expense. Expected tax in excess of actual tax variance is favorable; actual tax in excess of expected tax variance is unfavorable. The variance divided by diluted shares outstanding at the end of the period yields the impact on earnings per share. Management believes the use of this measure best aids in explaining the impact of a changing tax rate.
