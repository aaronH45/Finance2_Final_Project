Section 7 - Regulation FD

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure

On February 25, 2022, Exelon Corporation (“Exelon”) filed its 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Exelon Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2021, in the Form 10-K includes the results of Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (formerly Exelon Generation Company, LLC) (“Generation”), whose separation from Exelon was completed on February 1, 2022. Exelon’s GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings was $1.74 per share and $2.82 per share, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.

GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for Exelon’s utility subsidiaries and the holding company was $1.95 per share and $2.08 per share, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Beginning with the Form 10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2022, Exelon will present Generation’s financial results as discontinued operations for the period in 2022 prior to the separation on February 1, 2022 (January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2022) and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and will report its utility and holding company financial results as continuing operations. Exelon is also required to recast its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 to present Generation’s financial results as discontinued operations in those periods. Accounting rules require that certain corporate overhead costs previously allocated to Generation be presented as part of Exelon’s continuing operations as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations.

Exelon reaffirms its guidance range for full year 2022 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings of $2.18-$2.32 per share from its utility subsidiaries and holding company, as first presented during its Analyst Day on January 10, 2022. The presentation that will be used for Exelon’s winter and spring 2022 investor meetings reflects these 2021 actual financial results as well as select 2021 operational metrics and is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The presentation may also be accessed on the Investor Relations page of Exelon’s website: www.exeloncorp.com. 

The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth in such a filing.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP Net Income measures.

Exelon’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 do not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP Net Income:
