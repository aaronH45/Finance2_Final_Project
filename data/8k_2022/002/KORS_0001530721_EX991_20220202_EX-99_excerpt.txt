Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Results

Financial Results and non-GAAP Reconciliation

The Company’s results are reported in this press release in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information is provided at the end of this press release. Due to the current and ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company will not be providing comparable store sales results. The Company believes the most comprehensive measure of performance in this environment is total revenues compared to the same period in the prior year.

Overview of Capri Holdings Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Results:

•Total revenue of $1.6 billion increased 24% compared to last year. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 25%.

•Gross profit was $1.0 billion and gross margin was 65.1%, compared to $848 million and 65.1% in the prior year. Adjusted gross profit was $1.0 billion and adjusted gross margin was 65.1%, compared to $843 million and 64.7% in the prior year. Adjusted gross margin expansion reflected the strong ongoing benefits of the Company’s strategic initiatives, largely offset by approximately 400 basis points of higher supply chain costs compared to prior year. 

•Income from operations was $331 million and operating margin was 20.6%, compared to $167 million and 12.8% in the prior year. Adjusted income from operations was $359 million and operating margin was 22.3%, compared to $257 million and 19.7% in the prior year.

•Net inventory on December 25, 2021 was $978 million, a 24.0% increase compared to the prior year. This includes a significant increase in in-transit inventory. On-hand inventory levels were lower than expected which constrained the Company’s ability to deliver higher revenue in the quarter.

Outlook

The following guidance is provided on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis. Due to the ongoing dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, financial results could differ materially from the current outlook due to a number of external events which are not reflected in our guidance, including any significant additional store closures or new government restrictions that could further impact traffic and sales trends as well as any greater supply chain disruptions that could further extend inventory delays or increase transportation expenses.

The Company also notes that Fiscal 2022 includes a 53rd week in its fiscal fourth quarter. 

Given the impact of the pandemic and ongoing supply chain challenges, the Company is also providing its preliminary view of Fiscal 2023.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Constant currency effects are non-GAAP financial measures, which are provided to supplement our reported operating results to facilitate comparisons of our operating results and trends in our business, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Because we are a global company, foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant effect on our reported results. We calculate constant currency measures and the related foreign currency impacts by translating the current year’s reported amounts into comparable amounts using prior year’s foreign exchange rates for each currency. All constant currency performance measures discussed below should be considered a supplement to and not in lieu of our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, this earnings release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain costs associated with COVID-19 related charges, long-lived asset impairments, ERP implementation costs, Capri transformation costs, restructuring and other charges. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, among other things, to evaluate its operating performance and in order to represent the manner in which the Company conducts and views its business. The Company believes that excluding these items helps its management and investors compare operating performance based on its ongoing operations. While the Company considers the non-GAAP measures to be useful supplemental measures in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, nor act as a substitute for, any amounts presented in its consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies.
