COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb 24, 2022 - American Electric Power (Nasdaq: AEP) today reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), of $539 million or $1.07 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $436 million or $0.88 per share in fourth-

quarter 2020. Operating earnings for fourth-quarter 2021 were $496 million or $0.98 per share, compared with operating earnings of $433 million or $0.87 per share in fourth-quarter 2020. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure representing GAAP earnings excluding special items. 

Year-end 2021 GAAP earnings were $2.5 billion or $4.97 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.2 billion or $4.44 per share for year-end 2020. Year-end 2021 operating earnings were $2.4 billion or $4.74 per share, compared with operating earnings of $2.2 billion or $4.44 per share for year-end 2020.

A full reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date is included in the tables at the end of this news release.

“Our strong 2021 performance was driven by continued strategic investments in a clean, reliable, resilient and cost-effective energy system to benefit our customers and communities,” said Nicholas K. Akins, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “As we continue to build on our successful track record of investing capital and optimizing our portfolio to support earnings growth, we are pleased to share that we are raising our 2022 operating earnings guidance range to $4.87 to $5.07 per share, increasing our long-term growth rate target to 6% to 7% and lifting our FFO-to-debt target to 14% to 15%. 

“In line with our commitment to prioritize investments in our regulated businesses, AEP is beginning a process to sell all or a portion of our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio. This move will simplify and de-risk the company while allowing us to redeploy capital to our regulated businesses, where we see a meaningful pipeline of investment opportunities to enhance service for customers across our footprint.

“We are shifting $1.5 billion in our five-year capital plan to transmission and eliminating growth capital in the unregulated contracted renewables business. This brings our planned transmission capital investment to $14.4 billion as we advance projects that modernize the grid and support the clean energy transition. 

“We plan to add approximately 16,000 megawatts of renewables in our regulated states by 2030, and our work is well underway. A key milestone in these efforts is the completion of Traverse, the largest single wind farm ever built in North America. Traverse is in the final stages of commissioning, and we expect the facility to go online soon. Traverse, Maverick and Sundance make up our North Central Energy Facilities that will deliver an estimated $3 billion in customer savings over the next 30 years. These clean energy investments and our focus on deploying new technologies and enhancing the grid ensure we are on track to reach our goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050,” Akins said.

“Our load growth in 2021 was the strongest in more than a decade as the economy recovered from the impacts of the pandemic, and we expect to maintain that momentum this year. Our robust economic

2

development efforts have contributed to significant business expansion and relocation in our service territory, and we continue to work closely with our partners to identify new load growth opportunities that support job creation in our communities.

“Finally, as we announced in October, we expect to close on the sale of our Kentucky operations in the second quarter of 2022 once we receive the necessary state and federal regulatory approvals. We are working closely with Liberty to ensure a smooth transition for customers in the area and the Kentucky employees who will transfer to Liberty after the close of the sale,” Akins said.
