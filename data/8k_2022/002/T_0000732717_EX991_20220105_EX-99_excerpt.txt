•For the fourth quarter of 2021, AT&T delivered total postpaid net adds of 1.3 million, including approximately 880,000 postpaid phones.

•For the full-year 2021, postpaid phone net adds were 3.2 million, AT&T’s highest annual postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade as the company continues to benefit from strong network performance and its disciplined and consistent go-to-market strategy.

Full-year 2021 fiber net adds totaled about 1.0 million, the fourth consecutive year in which the company has added 1 million or more fiber subscribers. AT&T ended the year with an additional 2.6 million fiber customer locations, compared to its prior expectation of about 2.5 million.
