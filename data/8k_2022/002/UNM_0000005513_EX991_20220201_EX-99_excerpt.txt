RESULTS BY SEGMENT

We measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of investment gains or losses, amortization of cost of reinsurance, and certain other items. Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for income before income tax or net income. 

Unum US Segment

Unum US reported adjusted operating income of $81.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of 43.3 percent from $143.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Premium income for the group disability line of business increased 5.0 percent to $682.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $650.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, due to higher premium levels in the short-term disability product line, partially offset by lower persistency. Net investment income increased 1.5 percent to $94.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $93.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by higher miscellaneous investment income and a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by a decline in the yield on invested assets. The benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 78.3 percent, compared to 72.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, due to higher average claim size and higher incidence in group long-term disability.

Net investment income increased 21.3 percent to $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $23.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, due primarily to higher miscellaneous investment income and a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by a decline in the yield on invested assets The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 98.3 percent, compared to 90.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, due to higher incidence in the group life product line, resulting from the impacts of COVID-19, and higher average claim size. Also impacting the operating results for the group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business is a decrease in the deferral of acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to lower expected recoverability in the short-term.

to $59.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $56.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher miscellaneous investment income.

Closed Block Segment

The Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $76.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, which excludes the amortization of the cost of reinsurance related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction of $19.7 million, compared to $104.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluded from the fourth quarter of 2020 results were the impacts from the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction of $1,305.5 million, the amortization of the cost of reinsurance related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction of $2.6 million, the long-term care reserve increase of $151.5 million, and the reserve increase in group pension within the all other product line of $17.5 million. Premium income for this segment declined 2.3 percent to $244.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, due to policy terminations, partially offset by rate increases on certain in-force business in the long-term care product line. Net investment income decreased 20.8 percent to $282.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $356.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, due to a decrease in the level of invested assets supporting the individual disability line of business resulting from the reinsurance transaction that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, as well as a decline in the yield on invested assets. These decreases were partially offset by higher miscellaneous investment income. 

The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 82.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 60.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, which excludes the previously discussed reserve increase related to the update of assumptions during the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by unfavorable policy terminations, lower claimant mortality, and higher submitted claims. Excluding the reserve increase related to the assumption update during the third quarter of 2021, the interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business for full year 2021 was 77.3 percent which is below our long-term expected range. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability line of business was 75.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to 79.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, which excludes the impacts from the first phase of the reinsurance transaction that closed in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven primarily by lower submitted claims.

Corporate Segment 

The Corporate segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $45.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $42.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, due primarily to higher interest and operating expenses, partially offset by higher net investment income.

Outlook 

The Company anticipates hosting a conference call on February 25, 2022 to provide its outlook for 2022. Details will be provided closer to the event. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure of "after-tax adjusted operating income" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of investment gains or losses and the amortization of the cost of reinsurance as well as certain other items as specified in the reconciliations in the Financial Highlights section below. Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives. We believe after-tax adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.

Investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of investment gains or losses. Although we may experience investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.

We have exited a substantial portion of our Closed Block individual disability product line through the two phases of the reinsurance transaction that were executed in December 2020 and March 2021, respectively. As a result, we exclude the amortization of the cost of reinsurance that was recognized upon the exit of the business related to the ceded reserves for the cohort of policies on claim status. We believe that the exclusion of the amortization of the cost of reinsurance provides a better view of our results from our ongoing businesses. 

We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.
