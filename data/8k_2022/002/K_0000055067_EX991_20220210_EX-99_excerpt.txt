Kellogg Company Reports 2021 Results and Issues 2022 Financial Guidance

BATTLE CREEK, Mich. - February 10, 2022 - Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) today announced fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and provided a financial outlook for 2022.

Highlights:

•The Company delivered full-year financial results consistent with its guidance across all metrics, despite a challenging operating environment that featured high cost inflation, worldwide supply disruptions as well as a labor strike and fire in the Company's North America cereal manufacturing facilities.

•Net Sales growth in 2021 was driven by positive price/mix and notable momentum in snacks and emerging markets.

•These trends continued in the fourth quarter, though net sales were negatively affected by lapping an extra week in the year-earlier period.

•The Company issued 2022 financial guidance that calls for currency-neutral growth in net sales, operating profit, and earnings per share, even as it expects the challenging operating environment to persist.

 "As we've closed the books on fiscal year 2021, I could not be more proud of our organization’s focus and determination to work through challenges and deliver on our financial commitments," said Steve Cahillane, Kellogg Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Facing significant cost inflation, worldwide bottlenecks and shortages, and even a labor strike at all of our U.S. cereal facilities in the fourth quarter, the team executed with agility to deliver another year of on-guidance results."

Mr. Cahillane added, "We enter 2022 with growth momentum, financial flexibility from strong cash flow and balance sheet, and enhanced capabilities that will continue to enable us to manage through challenging business conditions."

Guidance and goals expressed in this press release are on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted to exclude restructuring charges, mark-to-market adjustments of pensions (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), certain equity investments and various financial instruments, and other costs impacting comparability. Organic basis also excludes acquisitions, divestitures and differences in shipping days, including the 53rd week. Expected net sales, margins, operating profit, and earnings per share are provided on a non-GAAP basis only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is unavailable, dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the Company. Please refer to the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section included later in this press release for a further discussion of our use of non-GAAP measures, including quantification of known expected adjustment items. The company will use the term "low single digit" to refer to percent changes of up to 3%, "mid single-digit" to refer to percent changes between 4% and 6%, "high single-digit" to refer to percent changes between 7% up to 10%, and "double-digit" to refer to percent changes of 10% or more.

Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2021 Consolidated Results

 Kellogg's fourth quarter 2021 GAAP (or "reported") net sales declined by approximately 1% year on year as positive price/mix in all four regions partially offset the impact of adverse foreign currency translation and lapping a prior-year quarter that included an additional shipping week. On an organic basis, which excludes the impact of currency and the 53rd week, net sales increased by 5% year on year.

 Full year 2021 reported net sales increased by approximately 3% year on year, driven by positive price/mix in all four regions as well as modestly favorable foreign currency translation, which together more than offset the impact of lapping the prior fiscal year that included a 53rd week.  On an organic basis, net sales increased by 3.5%, despite lapping unusually strong, pandemic-aided organic growth in 2020; this was modestly higher than Company guidance.

 Fourth quarter 2021 reported operating profit declined by almost 15% versus the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of supply disruptions worldwide, including a 12-week labor strike at the Company's U.S. cereal plants that followed a fire at one of the facilities last summer, as well as to adverse mark-to-market charges and lapping the year-ago quarter’s additional shipping week. On an adjusted basis, which excludes mark-to-market and restructuring charges, operating profit declined by 12%, and by 11% excluding currency.

 Full year 2021 reported operating profit decreased by less than 1% year on year, and closer to flat on an adjusted basis. The decline was attributable to supply disruptions worldwide, including the fourth-quarter 

 2

labor strike and third-quarter fire, as well as accelerated cost inflation.  Excluding currency translation, adjusted-basis operating profit declined 2%, in line with Company guidance.

Fourth quarter 2021 reported earnings per share more than doubled year over year, despite the strike, fire and other supply disruptions worldwide, as well as a modestly higher effective tax rate that were more than offset by a favorable mark-to-market gain, and by lapping debt redemption costs in the year-ago quarter. On an adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted basis, earnings per share declined by less than 4%, 

 Full year reported earnings per share increased 19% from the prior year due primarily to a favorable mark-to-market gain, partially offset by the impact of the strike and fire in the second half, lower other income related to expected returns in pensions, as well as worldwide supply chain disruptions and accelerating cost inflation throughout the year. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 4%. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 1%, in line with Company guidance.

Full year net cash provided by operating activities was $1,701 million. After capital expenditures of $553 million, cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditure, was $1,148 million. This result was in line with Company guidance.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Business Performance

Please refer to the segment tables in the back of this document. 

Amidst the persisting pandemic, Kellogg Company in 2021 remained focused on employee safety, food supply, and giving back to its communities. Continuing to execute against its Deploy for Growth strategy, the Company was able to execute through numerous supply disruptions and high cost inflation, and delivered on its twice-raised financial guidance for the full year.

The Company continued to face an unusually challenging business environment in the fourth quarter marked by a resurgence of COVID-19, persistent worldwide bottlenecks and shortages, and accelerating cost inflation. Its results were also negatively impacted by the strike of approximately 1,400 union employees at the Company's four U.S. cereal plants, which began in early October and ended in late December. While working through these challenging supply conditions, the Company also continued to largely offset market-driven cost inflation with productivity and revenue growth management efforts, while sustaining strong momentum in its international regions, and in its North America snacks business.

Kellogg North America's reported net sales in the fourth quarter decreased by approximately 3%, reflecting the negative impact of supply disruptions, notably the 12-week labor strike, and the lapping of an extra shipping week in the year-earlier quarter partially offset by strong price/mix growth, momentum in snacks, and a recovery in away-from-home channels. On an organic basis, net sales improved by 4%. Kellogg North America's reported operating profit declined by 20%, reflecting high cost inflation, economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, the labor strike, and the lapping of an extra shipping week in the year-ago quarter. On an adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit decreased by 19%.

 For the full year, Kellogg North America's reported net sales declined by 2% due to the negative impact of supply disruptions, notably the 12-week labor strike and earlier fire, as well as the lapping of the prior fiscal year’s 53rd week, partially offset by strong price/mix growth, momentum in snacks, and a recovery in away-from-home channels. On an organic basis, net sales decreased by 1%. Kellogg North America's reported operating profit decreased 10% reflecting high cost inflation, economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, the labor strike, the lapping of an extra shipping week in the year-ago quarter, and higher restructuring charges. On an adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit declined 9%. 

 3

Kellogg Europe's reported net sales in the fourth quarter decreased by approximately 6%, due to adverse foreign currency translation and lapping an extra shipping week in the year-earlier quarter partially offset by positive price/mix that nearly offset a volume decline against an especially strong year-ago gain. On an organic basis, net sales declined by less than 1%. Kellogg Europe's reported operating profit decreased by approximately 7%, reflecting high cost inflation and the lapping of an extra shipping week in the year-ago quarter.  On an adjusted and currency-neutral basis, operating profit decreased by approximately 13%.

 For the full year, Kellogg Europe's reported net sales increased by approximately 7%, reflecting accelerated price/mix growth, as well as business momentum that produced volume growth on top of a notably strong year-ago gain as well as favorable currency translation that more than offset the impact of lapping the prior fiscal year’s 53rd week. On an organic basis, net sales increased by over 4%. Full year reported operating profit increased approximately 16%, due to lower one-time charges and the impact of higher net sales. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased by 12%, and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit increased by approximately 7%.

 Kellogg Latin America's reported net sales in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 6% as strong price realization, along with Pringles consumption growth momentum in Mexico and Brazil, more than offset adverse foreign currency translation and the lapping of notably strong volume growth in the year-ago quarter. On an organic basis, net sales grew by nearly 9%. Kellogg Latin America's reported operating profit increased by approximately 72% in the fourth quarter, lapping a year-ago quarter that included costs related to newly implemented labeling regulations in Mexico, and benefiting from strong net sales growth. On an adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit increased approximately 62%.

 For the full year, Kellogg Latin America's reported net sales increased by 9%, driven by strong price/mix growth, favorable foreign currency translation, and business momentum that supported volume growth on top of a surge in the prior year. On an organic basis, net sales increased by approximately 7%. Kellogg Latin America's full year reported operating profit increased 13% as the net sales growth and favorable foreign currency translation more than offset the impact of high cost inflation.  On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased by approximately 11%, while on a currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit increased approximately 8%.

Kellogg Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa's ("AMEA") reported net sales in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 7%, as broad-based consumption growth momentum and strong price/mix growth more than offset the negative impacts of adverse foreign currency translation and the lapping of an extra shipping week in the year-earlier quarter. On an organic basis, net sales increased by 15%. Kellogg AMEA's reported operating profit increased by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, as strong net sales growth and lower one-time charges more than offset the negative impacts of supply disruptions, high cost inflation, and the lapping of an extra shipping week in the year-ago quarter. On an adjusted and currency-neutral basis, operating profit declined 6% and 2%, respectively. 

 For the full year, Kellogg AMEA's reported net sales increased by approximately 16% with strong growth in cereal, noodles, and snacks partially offset by adverse foreign currency translation and the lapping of a 53rd week in the prior fiscal year. On an organic basis, net sales increased by approximately 18%. Kellogg AMEA's reported operating profit increased approximately 22% behind the region's strong net sales growth, as well as lower-one time charges. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased 13% and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit increased 12%.

2022 Full-Year Financial Guidance

The Company issued its initial financial guidance for 2022. In spite of continued economy-wide supply challenges, the residual impact of the U.S. cereal labor strike and fire, and further acceleration in cost inflation, the Company is projecting:

•Organic net sales growth of approximately 3%, led by price/mix growth. 

•Adjusted operating profit growth of 1-2% on a currency-neutral basis.

•Adjusted earnings per share growth of 1-2% on a currency-neutral basis.

•Net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $1.7-1.8 billion, with capital expenditure of about $0.6 billion. As a result, cash flow is expected to be in the $1.1-1.2 billion range.

Excluded from this guidance, are any significant supply chain or other prolonged market disruptions related to the pandemic or global economy.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

 This filing includes non-GAAP financial measures that we provide to management and investors that exclude certain items that we do not consider part of on-going operations. Items excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are discussed in the "Significant items impacting comparability" section of this filing. Our management team consistently utilizes a combination of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate business results, to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions, including incentive compensation. As a result, we believe the presentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors’ understanding of our underlying operating performance and in their analysis of ongoing operating trends. All historic non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 

 Non-GAAP financial measures used include currency-neutral and organic net sales, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit excluding divestiture, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted EPS excluding divestiture, currency-neutral adjusted gross profit, currency-neutral adjusted gross margin, adjusted other income (expense), adjusted effective income tax rate, net debt and cash flow. We determine currency-neutral results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.

•Currency-neutral net sales and organic net sales: We adjust the GAAP financial measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral net sales. In addition, we exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency, and differences in shipping days including 53rd week, resulting in organic net sales. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying net sales performance. By providing these non-GAAP net sales measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of net sales performance for the Company and each of our reportable segments for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives behind net sales growth, pricing realization, and the impact of mix on our business results. These non-GAAP measures are also used to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions.

•Adjusted: operating profit and diluted EPS: We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, gain/loss on the divestiture, and other costs impacting comparability resulting in adjusted. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. Additionally, in order to provide visibility for two-year performance as we evaluate results during the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilize adjusted operating profit and EPS excluding divestiture, which excludes the direct impacts from the 2019 divestiture of our selected cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses.

•Currency-neutral adjusted: gross profit, gross margin, operating profit, and diluted EPS: We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, gain/loss on the divestiture, other costs impacting comparability, and foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral adjusted. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. Additionally, in order to provide visibility for two-year performance as we evaluate results during the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilize adjusted operating profit and EPS excluding divestiture, which excludes the direct impacts from the 2019 divestiture of our selected cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses.

•Adjusted other income (expense): We adjust the GAAP financial measure to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded) and certain equity investments, and other costs impacting comparability. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing this non-GAAP measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's other income (expense), net, excluding the impact of the items noted above, for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability.

•Adjusted effective income tax rate: We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments, and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, gain/loss on the divestiture, and other costs impacting comparability. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our pre-tax income and the related tax effect of those items on our adjusted effective income tax rate, and other impacts to tax expense, including tax reform in the UK and U.S. and certain foreign valuation allowances. By providing this non-GAAP measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's effective tax rate, excluding the pre-tax income and tax effect of the items noted above, for the periods presented. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to monitor the effectiveness of initiatives in place to optimize our global tax rate.

•Net debt: Defined as the sum of long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable, less cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. With respect to net debt, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities are subtracted from the GAAP measure, total debt liabilities, because they could be used to reduce the Company’s debt obligations. Company management and investors use this non-GAAP measure to evaluate changes to the Company's capital structure and credit quality assessment.

•Cash flow: Defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. Cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases once all of the Company’s business needs and obligations are 

 7

met. Additionally, certain performance-based compensation includes a component of this non-GAAP measure.

 These measures have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.

 Forward-looking guidance for organic net sales, currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, currency-neutral diluted EPS, and cash flow is included in this press release. Guidance for organic net sales excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions, divestitures, and differences in shipping days, including 53rd week. Guidance for operating profit excludes the impact of costs related to restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), and other items that could affect comparability, and foreign currency translation. Guidance for earnings per share excludes the impact of costs related to restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), gains or losses on divestitures, and other items that could affect comparability, and foreign currency translation. We have provided these non-GAAP measures for future guidance for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-GAAP measures.

 We are unable to reasonably estimate the potential full-year financial impact of mark-to-market adjustments because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions (interest rates, return on assets, and commodity prices). Similarly, because of volatility in foreign exchange rates and shifts in country mix of our international earnings, we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential full-year financial impact of foreign currency translation. 

 As a result, these impacts are not included in the guidance provided. Therefore, we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures used in our guidance without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a GAAP basis is unavailable, dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the Company.

 See the table below that outlines the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded from non-GAAP guidance for 2022:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]* 2022 full year guidance for net sales, operating profit, and earnings per share are provided on a non-GAAP basis only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is unavailable, dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the Company. These items for 2022 include impacts of mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments, and certain foreign currency contracts. The Company is providing quantification of known adjustment items where available.

Significant items impacting comparability

Mark-to-market

We recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension and postretirement benefit plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. Actuarial gains/losses for pension plans were recognized in the year they occur. Mark-to-market gains/losses for certain equity investments are recorded based on observable price changes. Changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that were recognized in the quarter they occur. We recorded a pre-tax mark-to-market gain of $210 million and $166 million for the quarter and year ended January 1, 2022, respectively.
