Western Union Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results 

Q4 GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $0.42, adjusted EPS of $0.64 

Full year 2021 digital money transfer revenue grows 22% to more than $1 billion continuing double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter  

Company announces new $1 billion 3-year share repurchase authorization  

and dividend of $0.235 per share in first quarter of 2022  

DENVER, February 10, 2022: The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU), a global leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement and payments, today reported fourth quarter and full year financial results and provided its 2022 full year financial outlook.  

The Company’s fourth quarter revenue of $1.3 billion increased 1% on a reported basis and increased 2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. Fourth quarter revenue was driven by growth of digital money transfer and the Business Solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in retail money transfer. 

GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.42, compared to $0.43 in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP EPS was primarily due to a non-cash charge from the termination of the Company’s pension plan, partially offset by increased Business Solutions segment operating profit and lower planned marketing expense. 

Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.64, compared to $0.45 in the prior year period. Year-over-year growth in adjusted EPS was driven by similar factors that impacted GAAP EPS, adjusted for certain items including a non-cash charge from the termination of the Company’s pension plan and acquisition and divestiture costs. For a full reconciliation between GAAP and Adjusted EPS, please see the “Adjustment Items” section of this press release. 

The Company announced that its board of directors approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, expiring December 31, 2024. The Company also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.235 per common share, payable March 31, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2022. 

“I am excited to be at Western Union with its iconic brand, global reach, and an industry-leading digital offering. I believe these unique assets put the Company in a strong position to capitalize on future growth opportunities,” said Devin McGranahan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Union. “In 2021, in addition to maintaining our leadership in retail cross border payments, we continued to make investments to grow our digital customer base and enhance the long-term success of the Company.”  

“We delivered another strong quarter across our digital business, with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter and more than $1 billion in revenue for the year. We also broadened our capabilities with the commercial launch of our multi-currency payments wallet and our digital banking platform.”  

CFO Raj Agrawal stated, “During 2021, we generated over $1 billion of operating cash flow and returned more than $780 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We are pleased with the durability our business exhibited over the last twelve months, which allowed us to maintain strong profitability. We are also happy to announce a new share repurchase authorization and issue our financial outlook for 2022.”  

Q4 Business Highlights 

•

Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) revenues declined 1% on a reported basis, or were flat on constant currency basis, while transactions were also flat during the quarter. Regionally, transaction growth in MEASA, Europe and CIS, and LACA was offset by declines in APAC and North America.  

•

Digital money transfer revenues increased 13% on a reported basis, or 12% constant currency, and represented 24% and 37% of total C2C revenues and transactions, respectively. Digital money transfer reached new quarterly highs for revenue, transactions, and principal. Westernunion.com revenue grew 9% on a reported and constant currency basis, including cross-border revenue growth of 12%. As expected, digital growth rates continued to moderate, given the significant digital demand the Company experienced in 2020. 

•

Westernunion.com active users1 for the full year 2021 increased 6% year-over-year and the Western Union mobile app was again the most downloaded mobile app among peer money transfer companies during the fourth quarter, according to data provided by mobile app marketing firm Sensor Tower2. 

•

Western Union Business Solutions revenues increased 22% on a both reported and constant currency basis, resulting from improvement in international trade, as well as increased activity in the education and financial institution verticals. Other revenues, which consists primarily of retail bill payments in the U.S. and Argentina and money orders, increased 5% on a reported basis.

Q4 Financial Highlights 

•

GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 24.7%, compared to 17.9% in the prior year period. The adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 24.9%, compared to 18.8% in the prior year period. The increase in the Company’s GAAP and adjusted operating margins was primarily due to strong Business Solutions segment operating profit, lower planned marketing expense, lower agent losses, and favorable foreign exchange impact. For a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and Adjusted operating margin, please see the “Adjustment Items” section of this press release. 

•

The GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 6.7%, compared to 11.0% in the prior year period, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 12.1% in the quarter, compared to 11.6% in the prior year period. The decrease in the Company’s GAAP effective tax rate was due to discrete tax benefits associated with the pension termination. 

•

The Company returned $268 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, consisting of approximately $93 million in dividends and $175 million of share repurchases.  

2021 Full Year Financial Highlights 

•

The Company’s full year revenue of $5.1 billion increased 5% compared to the prior year, or 4% on a constant currency basis, including a less than 1% benefit from inflation in Argentina. The revenue increase was driven by a strong growth in digital money transfer and the Business Solutions segment. Total C2C revenue grew 4%, while digital money transfer revenue continued strong double-digit growth, increasing 22% compared to 2020, and exceeded $1 billion for the year. Business Solutions also contributed revenue growth, increasing 18% year-over-year. 

•

For the full year, the Business Solutions segment generated $422 million dollars of revenue, $120 million dollars of EBITDA, and $104 million dollars of operating profit excluding corporate allocations. In total, Business Solutions contributed approximately $0.22 to 2021 adjusted EPS. 

•

GAAP operating margin was 22.1%, compared to 20.0% in the prior year. The increase in GAAP operating margin was primarily attributable to revenue growth, mix of commissions and lower other variable costs, the elimination of restructuring expenses, and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by higher technology investment. Adjusted operating margin was 22.5% compared to 20.8% in the prior year with margin expansion driven by the same factors noted above and adjusted for restructuring expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs. 

•

The GAAP effective tax rate for 2021 was 13.9%, compared to 12.9% in the prior year, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.7%, compared to 13.0% in 2020. The increase in the GAAP tax rate was primarily due to deferred taxes recorded on the pending sale of Business Solutions, partially offset by discrete tax benefits associated with the pension termination. 

•

GAAP EPS was $1.97, compared to $1.79 in 2020. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.19, compared to $1.87 in 2020. The increase in GAAP earnings per share was primarily due to similar factors described above for operating margin increase, as well as a gain on an investment sale and fewer shares outstanding. Growth in adjusted EPS was driven by similar factors as above, adjusted for certain items as described in the “Adjustment Items” section below. 

•

GAAP cash flow from operating activities for the year exceeded $1 billion. The Company returned over $780 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases for the full year.  

2022 Outlook 

The Company expects the following financial outlook for full year 2022, which assumes no material change in macro-economic conditions.  

GAAP figures reflect an expected partial year of Business Solutions ownership including contractual payments to the buyer, representing profits between the first and second closings, associated divestiture and acquisition costs, and an estimated pre-tax gain of approximately $280 million, subject to regulatory and working capital adjustments. The recognition of the gain is expected to be split between two closings with approximately 60% expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2022 upon the first closing and the remainder on close two in the second half of 2022.  

Adjusted revenue growth and operating margin exclude contributions from Business Solutions. In addition, adjusted operating margin excludes associated divestiture and acquisition costs. The adjusted effective tax rate and EPS exclude the expected gain on sale and divestiture and acquisition costs. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Adjustment Items 

Adjusted operating profit metrics for 2021 periods exclude acquisition and divestiture costs. Adjusted tax rate and earnings per share metrics for 2021 periods exclude the following items net of related taxes, as applicable: acquisition and divestiture costs (all quarters), the impact from the gain on an investment sale (second quarter), debt retirement expenses (second quarter), Business Solutions change in permanent reinvestment tax assertion (third quarter), and non-cash expenses associated with the termination of the Company’s pension plan (fourth quarter). 

Adjusted operating profit, tax rate, and earnings per share metrics for 2020 periods exclude restructuring expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs, net of related taxes, as applicable. 

Although the Company has previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur restructuring costs in the future, these expenses were specific to the implementation of a global strategy initiative and the Company has therefore provided adjusted financial results that exclude these expenses. 

Additional Statistics 

Additional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental tables included with this press release.  

All amounts included in the supplemental tables to this press release are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, the percentage changes and margins disclosed herein may not recalculate precisely using the rounded amounts provided.  

Non-GAAP Measures 

Western Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. 

Reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the “Investor Relations” section of the Company’s website at

NOTES TO KEY STATISTICS 

(Unaudited) 

(in millions, unless indicated otherwise) 

Western Union’s management believes the non-GAAP financial measures presented provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operating results to assist management, investors, analysts, and others in understanding the Company’s financial results and to better analyze trends in the Company’s underlying business because they provide consistency and comparability to prior periods.  

A non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with the Company’s GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review the Company’s financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below, where not previously reconciled above.

Non-GAAP related notes: 

(j)

Represents the impact from the fluctuation in exchange rates between all foreign currency denominated amounts and the United States dollar. Constant currency results exclude any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate. The Company believes that this measure provides management and investors with information about revenue results and trends that eliminates currency volatility while increasing the comparability of the Company's underlying results and trends. 

(k)

On May 9, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its United States electronic bill payments business known as “Speedpay” to ACI Worldwide Corp. and ACW Worldwide, Inc. ("ACI") for approximately $750 million in cash. In addition, on May 6, 2019, the Company completed the sale of Paymap Inc. ("Paymap"), which provides electronic mortgage bill payment services, for contingent consideration and immaterial cash proceeds received at closing. Both Speedpay and Paymap were included as a component of "Other" in the Company’s segment reporting. 2019 revenues have been adjusted to exclude the carved out financial information for Speedpay and Paymap to compare the year-over-year revenue change. These financial measures are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measures. The Company has included this information because management believes that presenting these measures as adjusted to exclude divestitures will provide investors with a more meaningful comparison of results within the periods presented. 

(l)

Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”) results from taking operating income and adjusting for depreciation and amortization expenses. EBITDA results provide an additional performance measurement calculation which helps neutralize the operating income effect of assets acquired in prior periods. The Company ceased depreciation and amortization for its Business Solutions business during the second half of 2021 as this business was held for sale.  

(m)

Represents impact from expenses incurred in connection with an overall restructuring plan, approved by the Board of Directors on August 1, 2019, to improve the Company's business processes and cost structure by reducing headcount and consolidating various facilities. While certain of these expenses are identifiable to the Company's business segments, primarily to the Company's Consumer-to-Consumer segment, they have been excluded from the measurement of segment operating income provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. These expenses are therefore excluded from the Company's segment operating income results. While these expenses are specific to this initiative, the types of expenses related to this initiative are similar to expenses that the Company has previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future. The Company believes that, by excluding the effects of these charges that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of the Company's underlying operating results. As of December 31, 2020, all expenses associated with this plan have been incurred. 

(n)

Represents the impact from expenses incurred in connection with the Company's acquisition and divestiture activity, including for the review and closing of these transactions. The Company believes that, by excluding the effects of these charges that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of the Company's underlying operating results. 

(o)

On April 12, 2021, the Company sold a substantial majority of the noncontrolling interest it held in a private company for cash proceeds of $50.9 million. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain in the second quarter of 2021. The gain on the sale and the income taxes on the gain have been removed from adjusted results. The Company believes excluding the impact of this gain will provide investors with a more meaningful comparison of results with the historical periods presented.  

(p)

On April 1, 2021, the Company repaid $500 million of aggregate principal amount of 3.6% unsecured notes due in 2022 and incurred approximately $14.8 million of costs, excluding accrued interest, in connection with the repayment. The cost associated with the repayment was recorded to Other income/(expense), net, in the second quarter of 2021. The costs associated with the payment and related tax benefit have been removed from adjusted results. The Company believes excluding the impact of this charge will provide investors with a more meaningful comparison of results with the historical periods presented.  

(q)

Represents the settlement charges for the Company's defined benefit pension plan incurred in the fourth quarter of 2021. On July 22, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to terminate and settle this frozen defined benefit plan, and during the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company settled its obligations under the plan and transferred the corresponding amount of plan assets to the insurer. The expenses associated with the pension settlement were recorded to Pension settlement charges within Total other expense, net. The Company believes excluding the impact of this charge will provide investors with a more meaningful comparison of results with the historical periods presented. 

(r)

Represents the tax impact from changes to certain of the Company's permanent reinvestment assertions related to its decision to classify its Business Solutions business as held for sale in the third quarter of 2021. The Company believes excluding the impact of this charge will provide investors with a more meaningful comparison of results with the historical periods presented. 

(s)

During 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Business Solutions business to Goldfinch Partners LLC and The Baupost Group LLC for cash consideration of $910 million, subject to regulatory and working capital adjustments. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company expects to complete the first closing of the sale and to receive the entire cash consideration. The first closing primarily excludes the operations in the European Union and the United Kingdom. The second closing is expected to occur by late 2022. The sale is also expected to result in a gain, which will be recognized at each closing, based on the book values and fair values of the operations sold at each closing. The Company has excluded Business Solutions revenues, Business Solutions operating margin, excluding corporate expenses allocated to the Business Solutions segment, and the expected gain on the sale, net of related taxes from its 2022 adjusted outlook, as management believes that excluding the impact of the Business Solutions business, including the gain on sale, from the 2022 adjusted outlook will provide investors with a clearer and more meaningful comparison of results in 2022 and future periods.
