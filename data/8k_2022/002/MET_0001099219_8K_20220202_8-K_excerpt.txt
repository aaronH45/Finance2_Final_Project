Consolidated Company Outlook

We continue to closely monitor developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and assess its impact on our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. Due to the continued uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022, we have excluded assumptions related to COVID-19 from our near-term targets.

While the economic projections of the Federal Reserve Board suggest that the interest rates will increase in 2022, a prolonged low interest rate environment still remains possible. We believe that our investment portfolio is highly diversified and positioned to perform well in a variety of economic scenarios, including disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 As of December 31, 2021, we had $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding companies which is above the high end of our $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion holding company cash target. In 2022, we expect to maintain this holding company cash target and expect to be at or above the high end of this range.

Our capital stress testing and longstanding commitment to liquidity position us to withstand a variety of economic conditions. We do not expect any material liquidity deficiencies, and we expect to remain able to comply with the financial covenants of our credit agreements. We will continue reviewing accounting estimates, asset valuations and various financial scenarios for capital and liquidity implications. 

Assuming (i) interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of December 31, 2021, including a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of 1.51% at December 31, 2021, and 1.73% at December 31, 2022, (ii) a mid-single digit S&P Global Ratings 500 equity index annual return over the near-term, and (iii) positive low double digit private equity annual returns over the near-term consistent with historical long-term averages; we expect to maintain the two-year average annual ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items, at 65% to 75%. Due to higher 2021 adjusted earnings, we expect the 2021-2022 ratio to be at the lower end of the range before moving higher in 2022-2024. Based on the aforementioned assumptions, we continue to target an adjusted return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income other than foreign currency translation adjustments, of 12% to 14% over the near-term. Lastly, we remain on track to generate approximately $20.0 billion of free cash flow over the time period of 2020 through 2024.

 We are fully committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers, of less than 12.3% over the near-term. 

Furthermore, we continue to execute on our Next Horizon Strategy, which was introduced at our December 2019 Investor Day.

Our outlook relies on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks and other uncertainties, such as those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the evolving and highly uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, we will continually review our assumptions, implement mitigation plans, and take precautions. We may revise our outlook as we obtain more information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effect and efficacy of efforts taken to respond to it, economic conditions, regulatory changes, and other events, and the impact of these events on our business operations, investment portfolio, derivatives, financial results and financial condition.
