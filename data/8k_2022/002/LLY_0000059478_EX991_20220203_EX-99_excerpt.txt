Key Events Over the Last Three Months

Regulatory

•The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, and European Medicines Agency accepted Lilly's New Drug Application (NDA) in the U.S. and Japan, and Marketing Authorization Application in the European Union, respectively, for tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Lilly also submitted tirzepatide to six additional markets.

•The company initiated a rolling submission to the FDA for pirtobrutinib, seeking accelerated approval in mantle cell lymphoma, with expectations to complete the submission in 2022 and regulatory action anticipated in early 2023.

•The FDA accepted a supplemental NDA (sNDA) and granted priority review for Jardiance® for adults with heart failure independent of left ventricular ejection fraction.

•The company received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for an additional amyloid plaque lowering agent, N3pG 4.

•Lilly's bamlanivimab and etesevimab, administered together, were authorized by the FDA as the first and only neutralizing antibody therapy for emergency use in COVID-19 patients under the age of 12.

•The FDA has updated the Fact Sheet for bamlanivimab and etesevimab to include a new Limitation for Authorized Use: due to the high frequency of the Omicron variant, these antibody therapies are not currently authorized in any U.S. region. Authorization status will change as needed, depending on prevalence and trends of variants of concern.

•The company submitted a request for Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelovimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Authentic virus analysis of bebtelovimab confirm earlier pseudovirus findings, which demonstrate Lilly's investigational antibody neutralizes all known variants of concern, including Omicron.

•The FDA accepted an sNDA and granted priority review for baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19.

 3

•Lilly is in ongoing discussion with the FDA regarding the status of the sNDA for Olumiant® for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. At this point, the company does not have alignment with the FDA on the indicated population. Given the Agency's position, there is a possibility that this could lead to a Complete Response Letter. 

Clinical

•Lilly's lebrikizumab demonstrated significant skin improvement and itch relief when combined with topical corticosteroids in people with atopic dermatitis in its third Phase 3 study that supports regulatory submission in 2022.

•Lilly's mirikizumab demonstrated superiority over placebo in a Phase 3 maintenance study in ulcerative colitis that supports regulatory submissions in 2022.

•Based on top-line efficacy results from two pivotal Phase 3 trials (SLE-BRAVE-I and II), the company has decided to discontinue the Phase 3 development program for Olumiant in adults with active systemic lupus erythematosus.

Business Development/Other Developments

•The U.S. Government signed a purchase agreement for 614,000 additional doses of Lilly's bamlanivimab and etesevimab for the treatment or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 for a total of $1.29 billion. There were approximately 435,000 doses delivered in fourth-quarter 2021 with most of the remaining doses already shipped in January 2022.

•New guidelines released by the World Health Organization on treatments for COVID-19 strongly recommend the use of baricitinib in combination with corticosteroids for severely or critically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

•Lilly announced new investments to increase the company's manufacturing capacity for current and future medicines. Lilly plans to invest more than 400 million euros in a new site in Limerick, Ireland to expand the company's manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients. Lilly plans to invest more than $1 billion in a new site in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices.

 4

•Lilly and Foghorn Therapeutics Inc. announced a strategic collaboration for novel oncology targets using Foghorn's proprietary Gene Traffic Control® platform.

•The company and Entos Pharmaceuticals Inc. entered into a research and collaboration agreement to support the development of innovative therapies in multiple neurologic indications.

•Lilly and QILU Regor Therapeutics Inc. entered into a strategic collaboration to discover and develop novel therapies for metabolic disorders. 

•The company announced a 15 percent dividend increase for shareholders beginning in the first quarter of 2022.

•Lilly and UNICEF announced a collaboration to help improve health outcomes for 10 million children and adolescents living with chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCD) through 2025. Lilly has committed $14.4 million in support of UNICEF's lifesaving work.

"Lilly closed 2021 with another solid quarter. Throughout the year we delivered strong top- and bottom-line growth, with volume-driven growth across key brands," said Anat Ashkenazi, Lilly’s senior vice president and chief financial officer. "We continue to advance promising R&D opportunities and invest in potential launches that would bring needed therapies to patients worldwide. We expect to deliver top-tier revenue growth throughout the decade."

Fourth-Quarter Reported Results

In the fourth quarter of 2021, worldwide revenue was $8.000 billion, an increase of 8 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by an 11 percent increase in volume, partially offset by a 3 percent decrease due to lower realized prices. Key growth products, consisting of Trulicity®, Taltz®, Verzenio®, Jardiance, Olumiant, Emgality®, Retevmo®, Cyramza® and Tyvyt®, contributed 14 percentage points of revenue growth and represented 61 percent of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021, excluding COVID-19 antibodies. The company recognized worldwide revenue of $1.063 billion from COVID-19 antibodies during the quarter compared with $871.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, worldwide revenue increased 

 5

by 6 percent in the fourth quarter.

Revenue in the U.S. increased 13 percent, to $5.176 billion, driven by a 14 percent increase in volume, partially offset by a 2 percent decrease due to lower realized prices. The company recognized U.S. revenue from COVID-19 antibodies of $1.029 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $850.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding COVID-19 antibodies, revenue in the U.S. increased by 11 percent. The increase in U.S. volume was driven by certain key growth products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. 

Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, to $2.824 billion, as a 7 percent increase in volume was more than offset by a 6 percent decrease due to lower realized prices and a 1 percent decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The increase in volume outside the U.S. was primarily driven by increased volume for all key growth products, partially offset by decreased volume for Alimta®, Cymbalta® and Forteo® resulting from the entry of generic competition due to loss of exclusivity in certain major markets. The lower realized prices were primarily driven by the impact of the updated National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) formulary for certain products, largely Tyvyt, in China.

Gross margin increased 4 percent, to $5.950 billion, in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 74.4 percent, a decrease of 2.5 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies.

Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021, increased 5 percent to $3.551 billion compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Research and development expenses increased 7 percent to $1.959 billion, or 25 percent of revenue, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 therapies. Research and 

 6

development expenses for COVID-19 therapies were approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2 percent to $1.592 billion. 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development charges of $376.6 million related to business development transactions with Foghorn Therapeutics Inc., Entos Pharmaceuticals Inc., and QILU Regor Therapeutics Inc. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development charges of $366.3 million related to business development transactions with Innovent Biologics, Inc., Disarm Therapeutics, Inc., and Fochon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $104.5 million primarily related to impairment of an intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo Oncology. This impairment is a result of a decision by Bayer AG to discontinue the development of a Loxo Oncology Phase 1 molecule. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the company recognized income for asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $30.1 million, reflecting adjustments to prior period estimates for asset impairment and severance costs. 

Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $1.917 billion, compared to $1.992 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in operating income was driven by higher operating expenses, as well as higher asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges, largely offset by higher gross margin. Operating margin percent, defined as operating income as a percent of revenue, was 24.0 percent.

Other income (expense) was expense of $77.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with income of $477.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The reduction in other income (expense) was primarily driven by net losses on investments in equity securities in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with net gains on investments in equity securities in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

 7

The effective tax rate was 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. The lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily driven by net discrete tax items in both periods, as well as the tax benefit related to net losses on investments in equity securities compared with higher tax expense related to net gains on investments in equity securities in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, net income and EPS both decreased 18 percent, to $1.726 billion and $1.90, compared with $2.117 billion and $2.32, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net income and EPS in the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased compared to the same period in 2020 driven by a reduction in other income (expense) and, to a lesser extent, lower operating income, partially offset by lower income tax expense. 

Fourth-Quarter Non-GAAP Measures

On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter of 2021 gross margin increased 4 percent, to $6.087 billion compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 76.1 percent, a decrease of 2.5 percentage points. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies. 

Operating income on a non-GAAP basis increased $80.1 million, or 3 percent, to $2.536 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, due to higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating margin was 31.7 percent on a non-GAAP basis.

Other income (expense) on a non-GAAP basis was expense of $6.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with expense of $31.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 10.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 13.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. The lower effective tax rate was primarily driven by net discrete tax items in both quarters. 

 8

On a non-GAAP basis, in the fourth quarter of 2021 net income and EPS both increased 8 percent, to $2.268 billion and $2.49, compared with $2.108 billion and $2.31, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increases in net income and EPS were primarily driven by higher operating income.

The increase in volume outside of the U.S. was primarily driven by increased volume for all key growth products. The lower realized prices were primarily driven by the price impacts of certain products on the NRDL formulary in China.

Gross margin increased 10 percent to $21.006 billion in 2021. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 74.2 percent, a decrease of 3.5 percentage points compared with 2020. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies.

Total operating expenses increased 10 percent to $13.457 billion in 2021. Research and development expenses increased 15 percent to $7.026 billion, or 24.8 percent of revenue. The increase was primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 5 percent to $6.432 billion, primarily due to increased marketing costs to continue to drive growth for key products, investment in preparation for new launches, and lower marketing activities in 2020 as a result of pandemic-related spending reductions. 

In 2021, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development charges of $874.9 million resulting from business development transactions compared with $660.4 million in 2020. 

 10

In 2021, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $316.1 million.

In 2020, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $131.2 million. The charges were primarily related to severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken worldwide to reduce our cost structure.

Operating income in 2021 increased 5 percent compared with 2020 to $6.357 billion, as higher gross margin was partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher acquired in-process research and development charges, and higher asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges. Operating margin was 22.4 percent.

Other income (expense) was expense of $201.6 million in 2021 compared with income of $1.172 billion in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net gains on investments in equity securities and a charge of $405.2 million related to the repurchase of higher-cost debt.

For the full year of 2021, the effective tax rate was 9.3 percent, compared with an effective tax rate of 14.3 percent for the full year of 2020. The lower effective tax rate in 2021 was driven primarily by the tax impacts of acquired in-process research and development charges, lower net gains on investments in equity securities, as well as a net discrete tax benefit. 

For the full year of 2021, net income and EPS both decreased 10 percent, to $5.582 billion and $6.12, compared with $6.194 billion and $6.79, respectively, in 2020. The decreases in net income and EPS were driven by a reduction in other income (expense), partially offset by lower income taxes and higher operating income.

 11

On a non-GAAP basis for the full year of 2021, gross margin increased 13 percent, to $21.914 billion compared with the full year of 2020. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the full year of 2021 was 77.4 percent, compared with 79.3 percent for the full year of 2020. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies.

Operating income on a non-GAAP basis increased 16 percent to $8.457 billion driven by higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating margin was 29.9 percent.

Other income (expense) on a non-GAAP basis was income of $25.6 million for the full year of 2021, compared with expense of $150.8 million for the full year of 2020. The increase in other income (expense) was primarily driven by income from patent settlements in Europe for Alimta in 2021. 

The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 12.3 percent for the full year of 2021, compared with 13.0 percent for the full year of 2020, driven primarily by a net discrete tax benefit in 2021. 

On a non-GAAP basis, net income and EPS increased 20 percent to $7.437 billion and $8.16, respectively. The increases in net income and EPS were driven by higher operating income.

U.S. revenue was $588.3 million, a decrease of 30 percent, driven by lower realized prices and, to a lesser extent, decreased demand. Revenue outside of the U.S. was $304.2 million, an increase of 8 percent, primarily driven by increased volume.

 19

Due to competitive pressures, the company expects a continued price decline for Basaglar in the U.S. Basaglar is part of the company’s alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. Lilly reports as cost of sales payments made to Boehringer Ingelheim for royalties. 

Forteo

For the fourth quarter of 2021, worldwide Forteo revenue decreased 28 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, to $184.0 million. U.S. revenue decreased 10 percent, to $111.4 million, driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 45 percent to $72.6 million, primarily driven by decreased volume. 

For the full year of 2021, worldwide Forteo revenue decreased 23 percent to $801.9 million compared with the full year of 2020. U.S. Forteo revenue for 2021 was $441.6 million, a 13 percent decrease, driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher realized prices. Forteo revenue outside the U.S. was $360.3 million, a 33 percent decrease, driven by decreased volume and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices.

The company expects further volume declines for Forteo as a result of the entry of generic and biosimilar competition due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S., Japan and major European markets.

Emgality

U.S. revenue increased 33 percent, to $434.5 million, driven by higher realized prices and increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. was $142.7 million, an increase of $105.7 million primarily due to increased demand. 

Tyvyt

For the fourth quarter of 2021, the company's Tyvyt revenue in China was $77.8 million, a decrease of 24 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily driven by lower realized prices due to the impact of the updated NRDL formulary in China on Tyvyt, partially offset by increased demand. 

For the full year of 2021, the company's Tyvyt revenue in China was $418.1 million, an increase of 35 percent compared with the full year of 2020. This increase was due to increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices.

Tyvyt is part of the company’s alliance with Innovent. Lilly reports total sales of Tyvyt made by Lilly as revenue, with payments made to Innovent for its portion of the gross margin reported as cost of sales. Lilly also reports as revenue a portion of the gross margin for Tyvyt sales made by Innovent.

Numbers may not add due to rounding.

The table above reflects only line items with non-GAAP adjustments. 

(a)The company uses non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial statements reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company’s non-GAAP measures adjust reported results to exclude amortization of intangibles and other items that are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on the company’s reported operations for a period. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate the company’s ongoing operations. They can also assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
