Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was also $0.54, up 26% versus the prior year period (see attached footnotes for non-GAAP reconciliation). 

Sales of $5.9 billion increased 10% compared to the prior year on an as reported basis, and up 8% organically. GAAP net income from continuing operations was $381 million. Adjusted net income from continuing operations of $380 million increased 22% versus the prior year. Earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) was $543 million and EBIT margin was 9.3%. Adjusted EBIT was $542 million and adjusted EBIT margin was 9.2%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year. 

“We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2022, delivering strong order, revenue and profitability growth in the quarter, despite a continuously challenging operating environment,” said George Oliver, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our first quarter results further demonstrate our ability to execute, even as persistent supply chain disruptions and labor constraints presented increased inflationary headwinds. Order and revenue performance reflects continued robust demand for healthy, smart, and sustainable building solutions as well as our teams’ unwavering focus on serving our customers’ needs. We continue to reinvest in our business, both organically and inorganically, and remain committed to driving strong cash flow and returning capital to shareholders.” 

“Despite increased pressure from ongoing supply chain and labor constraints, we are reaffirming guidance for the full year,” said Olivier Leonetti, chief financial officer. “More importantly, we believe we remain well positioned for accelerated growth as we leverage our OpenBlue digital platform to capitalize on the global trend towards reducing carbon emissions and energy intensity and improving the overall health of indoor environments.”

Non-GAAP Financial Information

This press release contains financial information regarding adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The adjusting items include restructuring and impairment costs, net mark-to-market adjustments, Silent-Aire transaction costs and other nonrecurring costs, Power Solutions divestiture reserve adjustment and discrete tax items. Financial information regarding organic sales, adjusted sales, EBIT, EBIT margin, adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, total segment EBITA, adjusted segment EBITA, adjusted segment EBITA margin, adjusted corporate expense, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion and adjusted net income from continuing operations are also presented, which are non-GAAP performance measures.

FOOTNOTES

1. Financial Summary

The Company evaluates the performance of its business units primarily on segment earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA), which represents income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding general corporate expenses, intangible asset amortization, net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, and the net mark-to-market adjustments related to restricted asbestos investments and pension and postretirement plans. The financial results shown below are for continuing operations and exclude the Power Solutions business. Historical information has been re-cast for changes in the composition of reportable segments effective October 1, 2021, to present the comparative periods on a consistent basis.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted net sales, segment EBITA, adjusted segment EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA margins, which are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company's definition of adjusted net sales and adjusted segment EBITA excludes special items because these items are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of its businesses. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company. A reconciliation of segment EBITA to income from continuing operations is shown earlier within this footnote. For the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no items excluded from the calculation of adjusted net sales and adjusted segment EBITA.

(2) Adjusted amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2021 excludes $7 million of nonrecurring intangible asset amortization related to Silent-Aire purchase accounting.

(3) The three months ended December 31, 2021 exclude the net mark-to-market adjustments on restricted investments and pension and postretirement plans of $57 million. The three months ended December 31, 2020 exclude the net mark-to-market adjustment on restricted investments of $21 million.

(4) Restructuring and impairment costs for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $49 million are excluded from the adjusted non-GAAP results. The restructuring actions and impairment costs are related primarily to workforce reductions and other related costs.

(5) Management defines earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) as income from continuing operations before net financing charges, income taxes and noncontrolling interests. EBIT is a non-GAAP performance measure. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company. A reconciliation of EBIT to income from continuing operations is shown earlier within this footnote.

(6) Adjusted income tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2021 excludes tax provisions related to net mark-to-market adjustments of $14 million, partially offset by tax benefits related to restructuring and impairment costs of $7 million and Silent-Aire nonrecurring intangible asset amortization of $2 million. Adjusted income tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2020 excludes tax provision from net mark-to-market adjustments of $5 million. 

(7) Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three months ended December 31, 2021 excludes $5 million impact from restructuring and impairment costs.

2. Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation

The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The adjusting items include net mark-to-market adjustments, restructuring and impairment costs, Silent-Aire transaction costs and other nonrecurring costs, Power Solutions divestiture reserve adjustment, and discrete tax items. The Company excludes these items because they are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of the Company. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company has presented forward-looking statements regarding adjusted corporate expense, adjusted EPS, organic revenue, adjusted EBITA margin and free cash flow conversion, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses, income or cash flows from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period, including but not limited to the high variability of the net mark-to-market adjustments and the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Our fiscal 2022 second quarter and full year guidance for organic revenue also excludes the effect of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of the aforementioned forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s second quarter and full year 2022 GAAP financial results.

4. Free Cash Flow Conversion

The Company's press release contains financial information regarding free cash flow and free cash flow conversion, which are non-GAAP performance measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by adjusted net 

income attributable to JCI. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. These non-GAAP measures can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.

The following is the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for continuing operations (unaudited):

5. Net Debt to EBITDA

The Company provides financial information regarding net debt to adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The Company believes the total net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is useful to understanding the Company's financial condition as it provides a view of the extent to which the Company relies on external debt financing for its funding and is a measure of risk to its shareholders. The following is the December 31, 2021 calculation of net debt to adjusted EBITDA (unaudited):

The following is the last twelve months ended December 31, 2021 reconciliation of income from continuing operations to adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP performance measures (unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The Company's definition of adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA excludes special items because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of its businesses. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company. 

6. Trade Working Capital as a Percentage of Net Sales

The Company provides financial information regarding trade working capital as a percentage of net sales, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. Trade working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities, excluding cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, the current portion of long-term debt, the current portion of assets and liabilities held for sale, accrued compensation and benefits, and other current assets and liabilities. Management believes this non-GAAP measure, which excludes financing-related items, non-trade related items and businesses to be divested, is a more useful measurement of the Company's operating performance. The following is the December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 calculation of trade working capital as a percentage of net sales (unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

7. Income Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations before consideration of net mark-to-market adjustments, restructuring and impairment costs and discrete tax items for the three months ending December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is approximately 13.5%.

8. Restructuring and Impairment Costs

The three months ended December 31, 2021 include restructuring and impairment costs of $49 million related primarily to workforce reductions and other related costs.
