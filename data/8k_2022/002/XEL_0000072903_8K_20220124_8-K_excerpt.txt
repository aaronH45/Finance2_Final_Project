Item 8.01. Other Events

Colorado Natural Gas Rate Request

On Jan. 24, 2022, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel Energy), filed a request with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) seeking a net increase to retail natural gas rates of $107 million. The total change to base rates is $215 million, which reflects the transfer of $108 million previously recovered from customers through the Pipeline System Integrity Adjustment (PSIA) rider, which was closed to new investments at the end of 2021. The request is based on a 10.25% Return on Equity (ROE), an equity ratio of 55.66% and a 2022 current test year. PSCo has requested a proposed effective date of Nov. 1, 2022. 

Additionally, PSCo’s request includes step revenue increases of $40 million in 2023 (effective Nov. 1, 2023) and $41 million in 2024 (effective Nov. 1, 2024) related to continued capital investment. Under this proposal, PSCo would not request another base rate change prior to Nov. 1, 2025. An informational historical test year including a 10.75% ROE was also filed as required by the CPUC.

The request supports fundamental infrastructure investments to serve customers, consistent with PSCo’s obligation to provide safe, reliable service while enabling PSCo to continue to be a leader of the clean energy transition in partnership with the CPUC to achieve clean heat goals.
