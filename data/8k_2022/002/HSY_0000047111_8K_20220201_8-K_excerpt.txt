Item 7.01.Regulation FD Disclosure.

Since December 31, 2014, The Hershey Company (the “Company”) has reported its operations through two segments: (i) North America and (ii) International and Other. After the completion of the Company’s acquisitions of Dot’s Pretzels, LLC and Pretzels Inc. in December 2021, management of the Company has elected to begin reporting its operations through three reportable segments. Therefore, effective in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company realigned its former two reportable segments into three reportable segments: (i) North America Confectionery, (ii) North America Salty Snacks and (iii) International. 

This new organizational structure aligns with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker manages our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment, and further aligns with our product categories and the key markets we serve.

•North America Confectionery – This segment is responsible for our traditional chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position in the United States and Canada. This includes our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, gum and refreshment products, protein bars, spreads, snack bites and mixes, as well as pantry and food service lines. This segment also includes our retail operations, including Hershey’s Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania; New York, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain of the Company's trademarks and products to third parties around the world.

•North America Salty Snacks – This segment is responsible for our salty snacking products in the United States. This includes ready-to-eat popcorn, baked and trans fat free snacks, pretzels and other snacks.

•International – International is a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually material, including those geographic regions where we operate outside of North America. We currently have operations and manufacture product in Mexico, Brazil, India and Malaysia, primarily for consumers in these regions, and also distribute and sell confectionery products in export markets of Asia, Latin America, Middle East, Europe, Africa and other regions.

For informational purposes, included in Exhibit 99.1 to this report, is the Company’s historical recast of segment information that reflects the segment changes noted above.

The information furnished in this report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
