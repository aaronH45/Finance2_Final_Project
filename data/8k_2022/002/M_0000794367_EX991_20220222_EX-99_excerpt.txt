“Our results in the fourth quarter delivered a strong end to a solid year.

“Our team began the large-scale work of transforming Macy’s, Inc. two years ago when we launched the Polaris strategy, and today we believe the evidence is clear – our business is stronger, more agile, and financially healthier. We are more digitally led and customer centric and believe we are better positioned for long-term sustainable and profitable growth,” Gennette continued. “Thanks to the hard work of our colleagues, successful execution of Polaris, and the strategic allocation of our capital, we believe we are well-positioned to successfully navigate the macro-economic headwinds we expect in 2022.”

Enhancing Shareholder Value 

“We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow this year – a significant amount that allowed us to return capital to shareholders through our measured capital allocation plan while meaningfully improving the health of our balance sheet,” said Adrian Mitchell, chief financial officer of Macy’s, Inc. “The strength of our financial position offers the flexibility in 2022 to continue investing in growth opportunities, navigate the dynamic macro environment with agility, and further deliver on our commitment to enhance shareholder value.” 

During 2021, Macy’s, Inc.’s strong performance allowed it to take significant actions to strengthen its financial position and return capital to shareholders. And today, coupling 2021 performance with the long-term outlook, the company is announcing further actions to enhance shareholder value:  

•  

The company voluntarily retired debt early in 2021, driving its year-end Adjusted Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDAR leverage ratio well below the company’s 2021 target of no more than 2.5x.  

•  

The company reinstated its regular quarterly dividend in 2021 and today reported its board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 15.75 cents per share on Macy's, Inc.’s common stock, an increase of approximately 5%. The dividend is payable on April 1, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2022.  

•  

The company successfully completed its $500 million share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2021, and in total repurchased approximately 20.5 million shares during the year. The company’s board of directors has authorized a new, open-ended $2 billion share repurchase program.  

Results of Comprehensive Business Review  

The company’s Board of Directors, with the assistance of independent financial, legal and third-party advisors and the company’s management team, completed a lengthy comprehensive review of the company’s e-commerce and brick-and-mortar operations to consider the best path forward for Macy’s, Inc. to enhance value for shareholders. The review included the evaluation of a variety of alternatives for the company’s e-commerce business. Ultimately, based on the work

completed, the Board determined that an integrated, omnichannel Macy’s, Inc. with an acceleration of certain Polaris initiatives, will deliver greater value to our shareholders than a separation of digital and physical assets at either the enterprise or brand levels. Key to the Board’s decision-making were the high separation costs and ongoing costs from operating separated businesses, as well as high execution risk for the business and the company’s customers. As a result of the review, the company is accelerating Polaris initiatives that span digital, brand partners, private label, marketing and loyalty and the expansion of off-mall, small-format Market by Macy’s and Bloomie’s stores.  

“We are more confident in our path forward as one integrated company. The Board’s review reaffirmed our conviction that we are pursuing a robust strategy, and it provided us with greater clarity on several initiatives that could be further accelerated to unlock additional value for our shareholders, which we are pursuing,” said Gennette. “Our team will continue our work to deliver an even bolder and brighter future for Macy’s, Inc. and all its stakeholders, including our shareholders, our colleagues and our customers.” 

2022 Guidance  

Macy’s, Inc. anticipates positive momentum in 2022 supported by the Polaris initiatives and strong consumer demand. At the same time, the company expects macro environment challenges such as inflation, supply chain pressures, labor shortages and potential COVID-19 variants. The company’s annual guidance reflects a measured plan based on these assumptions.

Notes: 

(1)  

The 52 weeks ended January 30, 2021 also included non-cash impairment charges totaling $3.3 billion, which consisted of $3.1 billion of a non-cash goodwill impairment charge and $200 million impairment charge on long-lived tangible and right of use assets. 

(2)  

Income tax expense of $240 million and $436 million, or 24.3% and 23.4% of pretax income, for the 13 and 52 weeks ended January 29, 2022, respectively, reflect a different effective tax rate as compared to the company’s federal income tax statutory rate of 21% driven primarily by the impact of state and local taxes. 

The income tax expense of $154 million and income tax benefit of $846 million, or 49.0% and 17.7% of pretax income and loss, respectively, for the 13 and 52 weeks ended January 30, 2021, reflected a different projected benefit rate as compared to the company's federal income tax statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the carryback of net operating losses as permitted under the CARES Act. For the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2021, the benefit of the available carryback of net operating losses was offset by the impact of the non-tax deductible component of the goodwill impairment charge and additional income tax expense associated with the deferred tax remeasurement recognized during the first quarter of 2020. 

(3)  

Gross margin is defined as net sales less cost of sales.

Restricted cash of $3 million and $75 million have been included with cash and cash equivalents for the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively.

Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, which includes adjusting for the impact of comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties, assists in evaluating the company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. Earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure which the company believes provides meaningful information about its operational efficiency by excluding the impact of changes in tax law and structure, debt levels and capital investment. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items from EBITDA, net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share that are not associated with the company’s core operations and that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from period-to-period provides useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the company's ability to generate earnings and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods. Management also believes free cash flow provides a better indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Unlike cash flow provided by operating activities, free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures, providing a more complete picture of cash generation. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustment for certain non-discretionary cash flows such as mandatory debt repayments. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.  

The company does not provide reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP measures of adjusted EBITDA, diluted earnings per share, comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, and free cash flows to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results. 

Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Changes in Comparable Sales – 52 Weeks Ended January 29, 2022 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Notes: 

(5)  

Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores in operation during the 13 and 52 weeks ended January 29, 2022 and the 13 and 52 weeks ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively. Such calculation includes all digital sales and excludes commissions from departments licensed to third parties. Stores impacted by a natural disaster or undergoing significant expansion or shrinkage remain in the comparable sales calculation unless the store, or material portion of the store, is closed for a significant period of time. No stores have been excluded as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Definitions and calculations of comparable sales may differ among companies in the retail industry. 

(6)  

Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales in the calculation of comparable sales. The company licenses third parties to operate certain departments in its stores and online and receives commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net sales. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The company does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its comparable sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e., on an owned basis). The amounts of commissions earned on sales of departments licensed to third parties are not material to its net sales for the periods presented.
