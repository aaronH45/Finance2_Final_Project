Cash Returns to Shareholders and Capital Markets Activity

Share Repurchase Program

•Through December 31, 2021, Altria repurchased: 

•15.5 million shares at an average price of $45.40, for a total cost of $703 million in the fourth quarter.

•35.7 million shares at an average price of $46.97, for a total cost of $1.7 billion for the full year. 

•As of December 31, 2021, Altria had approximately $1.8 billion remaining under its existing $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which Altria expects to complete by December 31, 2022. Share repurchases depend on marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of Altria’s Board of Directors (Board). 

Dividends

•Altria paid dividends of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $6.4 billion for the full year. 

•Altria maintains its long-term objective of a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of its adjusted diluted EPS. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of Altria’s Board.

Smoke-free Products Business Platform 

Oral Tobacco

•Total U.S. oral tobacco category share for on! nicotine pouches grew to 3.9% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 0.9 percentage points sequentially and an increase of 2.8 percentage points from the end of 2020.

•As of December 31, 2021, on! was available for sale in approximately 117,000 U.S. retail stores.

•Premarket tobacco product applications (PMTA) for the entire on! portfolio, submitted in May 2020, remain pending with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

•Helix is actively working on modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) applications for on!, and expects to submit these MRTP applications to the FDA by the end of 2022.

•Copenhagen remained the largest U.S. oral tobacco brand. The MRTP application for Copenhagen Snuff, submitted in March 2018, remains pending with the FDA. 

Heated Tobacco

•Marlboro HeatSticks achieved a cigarette category retail share of 1.9% in Northern Virginia stores with distribution for the month of October. 

•On November 29, 2021, the importation ban and cease-and-desist orders imposed by the International Trade Commission (ITC) on the IQOS device, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components went into effect. PM USA believes it has complied with the orders; the IQOS system is no longer available for sale in the U.S. 

•Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) is responsible for manufacturing the IQOS system, and PM USA has been in communication with PMI regarding product availability. At the present time, PM USA does not expect to have access to IQOS devices or Marlboro HeatSticks in 2022. However, PM USA remains focused on returning IQOS to the market, is working on re-entry plans and expects to be ready to re-launch the product when it becomes available. The agreement with PMI contemplates disruptions, such as those caused by the ITC orders, and requires the parties to negotiate in good faith to amend the agreement appropriately.

•In the second quarter of 2020, Altria disclosed two milestones in its IQOS agreement with PMI necessary for PM USA to maintain its exclusive license and distribution rights for IQOS in the U.S. and to earn the renewal option for an additional five-year term. The initial five-year term does not expire until April 2024, but Altria believes that PM USA has already met these milestones based on the performance of IQOS in the Charlotte and Northern Virginia markets. PMI has communicated that it disagrees with Altria’s position. Altria expects to continue discussing these matters with PMI. 

E-Vapor

•PMTAs submitted in July 2020 by JUUL for its JUUL device and four JUULpod SKUs remain pending with the FDA.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 

Altria’s Corporate Responsibility Focus Areas are (i) reducing the harm of tobacco products, (ii) preventing underage use, (iii) protecting the environment, (iv) driving responsibility through our value chain, (v) supporting our people and communities and (vi) engaging and leading responsibly. Altria’s corporate responsibility reports can be found on the Corporate Responsibility Reports page at www.altria.com/responsibility. 

•In November, Altria released:

◦its 2020-2021 Protect the Environment corporate responsibility report; and 

◦its inaugural Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report. Altria is proud to be the first U.S tobacco company to join more than 2,700 supporters of the TCFD. 

•In the fourth quarter, Altria was recognized by the following third-party organizations: 

◦Altria was named a trendsetter for a sixth year by the CPA-Zicklin Index, which measures political transparency among S&P 500 companies and their voluntary disclosures of political spending. 

◦Altria was named to the inaugural Forbes Green Growth 50 list, which includes the only “big American corporations that have managed to slash their greenhouse gas emissions, while simultaneously growing earnings.” 

◦Altria was recognized for a second consecutive year with a double ‘A’ rating for tackling climate change and protecting water security by CDP, a non-profit organization that runs a global disclosure system on managing environmental impact. CDP’s A List distinguishes companies for leadership on transparency and action on key environmental issues. 

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

Impact on Tobacco Business Operations

•Altria’s tobacco businesses have not experienced a material adverse impact to date due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is continued uncertainty as to how the COVID-19 pandemic (including changes in COVID-19-related restrictions and guidelines) may impact adult tobacco consumers (ATC) in the future. Altria continues to monitor the macroeconomic risks of the COVID-19 pandemic (including risks associated with the timing and extent of vaccine administration and the impact of COVID-19 variants) and their effect on ATC, including stay-at-home practices and disposable income, which may be further impacted by unemployment rates and inflation. Altria also continues to monitor ATC purchasing behaviors, including overall tobacco product expenditures, mix between premium and discount brand purchases and adoption of smoke-free products.

•Altria believes that the COVID-19 pandemic altered ATC behaviors and purchasing patterns in the earlier stages of the pandemic. Altria estimates that although the number of ATC trips to the store remains below pre-pandemic levels, ATC tobacco expenditures per trip remain elevated. However, the environment continues to evolve and Altria believes rising gas prices, inflation and the reduction of COVID-19 relief programs led to a decrease in ATC disposable income on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In addition, Altria believes increased ATC mobility versus the prior year offered ATCs more options for their discretionary spending and led to fewer tobacco usage occasions versus the prior year. 

•Altria’s suppliers and those within its distribution chain continue to be subject to potential facility closures, remote working protocols and labor shortages. To date, Altria has not experienced any material disruptions to its supply chains or distribution systems but is continuing to monitor these factors. Altria continues to monitor the risk that the business of one or more suppliers, distributors or any other entities within its supply and distribution chains may be disrupted.

Impact on ABI, JUUL and Cronos Investments

•ABI continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, including the effects of COVID-19 variants, supply-chain constraints across certain markets, transactional foreign exchange and commodity cost headwinds. 

3

•During 2020 and 2021, JUUL’s operations were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to stay-at-home practices and government-mandated restrictions. While the impact was considered in Altria’s quantitative valuations conducted in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 and during 2020, Altria does not believe the COVID-19 pandemic was a primary driver of the non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge recorded during 2020 or any quarterly changes in fair value recorded since the fourth quarter of 2020. Altria will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (including the impact of new variants) on JUUL’s operations.

•Cronos has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, due in part to government actions limiting access to retail stores in the United States and Canada. Altria will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Cronos’s business, including as a result of new variants, near-term supply chain challenges, inflation and market valuation.

 Philip Morris Capital Corporation Update

As of December 31, 2021, Altria’s net finance assets balance was $114 million, down $206 million since the end of 2020 due to rents received and asset sales. As previously announced, Altria expects to fully complete the Philip Morris Capital Corporation (PMCC) wind-down by the end of 2022. 

2022 Full-Year Guidance

Altria expects its 2022 full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in a range of $4.79 to $4.93, representing a growth rate of 4% to 7% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $4.61 in 2021. Altria expects 2022 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted toward the second half of the year. While the 2022 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance accounts for a range of scenarios, the external environment remains dynamic. Altria will continue to monitor conditions related to (i) the economy, including the impact of increased inflation, (ii) the impact of current and future COVID-19 variants and mitigation strategies, (iii) ATC dynamics, including tobacco usage occasions, available disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of smoke-free products and (iv) regulatory and legislative developments. 

Altria’s 2022 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes planned investments in support of its Vision, such as (i) costs to enhance its digital consumer engagement system, (ii) increased smoke-free product research, development and regulatory preparation expenses and (iii) marketplace activities in support of Altria’s smoke-free products. The guidance range also includes anticipated inflationary increases in Master Settlement Agreement expenses and direct materials expenses and Altria’s current expectation that PM USA will not have access to the IQOS system in 2022. 

Altria expects its 2022 full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of 24.5% to 25.5%. Altria also expects 2022 capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $250 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $210 million. 

Altria’s full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance and full-year forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related and disposition-related costs, COVID-19 special items, equity investment-related special items (including any changes in fair value of the equity investment and any related warrants and preemptive rights), certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer (NPM) adjustment disputes under the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (such dispute resolutions are referred to as NPM Adjustment Items).

Altria’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on its reported diluted EPS or its reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result, Altria does not provide a corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted EPS guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast.

ALTRIA GROUP, INC.

See “Basis of Presentation” below for an explanation of financial measures and reporting segments discussed in this release. 

Financial Performance

Fourth Quarter

•Net revenues decreased 0.8% to $6.3 billion, primarily driven by no net revenues in the wine segment (due to the timing of the sale of the wine business), partially offset by higher net revenues in the financial services business (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual value of certain assets at PMCC in 2020), oral tobacco products and smokeable products segments. Revenues net of excise taxes increased 0.6% to $5.1 billion.

•Reported diluted EPS decreased 14.6% to $0.88, primarily driven by unfavorable Cronos-related special items, 2020 changes in the estimated fair value of Altria’s investment in JUUL and higher income taxes, partially offset by higher reported operating companies income (OCI), favorable net periodic benefit income and fewer shares outstanding. 

•Adjusted diluted EPS increased 10.1% to $1.09, primarily driven by higher adjusted OCI, favorable net periodic benefit income and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by higher income taxes. 

Full Year

•Net revenues decreased 0.5% to $26.0 billion, primarily driven by lower net revenues in the smokeable products and wine segments (due to the sale of the wine business), partially offset by higher net revenues in the financial services business (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual value of certain assets at PMCC in 2020) and oral tobacco products segment. Revenues net of excise taxes increased 1.3% to $21.1 billion.

•Reported diluted EPS decreased 44.2% to $1.34, primarily driven by lower reported earnings from Altria’s investment in ABI (due primarily to the 2021 impairment of its investment in ABI), losses on early extinguishment of debt and unfavorable Cronos-related special items. These items were partially offset by the 2020 net charges associated with Altria’s investment in JUUL, higher reported OCI, favorable net periodic benefit income and fewer shares outstanding.

•Adjusted diluted EPS increased 5.7% to $4.61, primarily driven by higher adjusted OCI, favorable net periodic benefit income, higher adjusted earnings from Altria’s investment in ABI and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate.

This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes. For other trade classes selling cigarettes, retail share is based on shipments from wholesalers to retailers (STARS). This service is not designed to capture sales through other channels, including the internet, direct mail and some illicitly tax-advantaged outlets. It is IRI’s standard practice to periodically refresh its services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Volume includes cans and packs sold, as well as promotional units, but excludes international volume, which is currently not material to the oral tobacco products segment. New types of oral tobacco products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing oral tobacco products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis. To calculate volumes of cans and packs shipped, one pack of snus or one can of oral nicotine pouches, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST. 

Retail Share & Brand Activity

Fourth Quarter

•Oral tobacco products segment retail share was 47.6% and Copenhagen continued to be the leading oral tobacco brand with a retail share of 28.6%. Share losses in the oral tobacco products segment, including Copenhagen, were due to the growth of oral nicotine pouches.

Full Year

•Oral tobacco products segment retail share was 47.8% and Copenhagen retail share was 29.4%. Share losses in the oral tobacco products segment, including Copenhagen, were due to the growth of oral nicotine pouches.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: The oral tobacco products retail share results exclude international volume. Retail share results for oral tobacco products are based on data from IRI InfoScan, a tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share and depict share trends. This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes on the number of cans and packs sold. Oral tobacco products is defined by IRI as moist smokeless, snus and oral nicotine pouches. New types of oral tobacco products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing oral tobacco products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis. For example, one pack of snus or one can of oral nicotine pouches, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST. Because this service represents retail share performance only in key trade channels, it should not be considered a precise measurement of actual retail share. It is IRI’s standard practice to periodically refresh its InfoScan services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.

Basis of Presentation

Altria reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. Altria’s management reviews OCI, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, the segments. Altria’s management also reviews certain financial results, including OCI, OCI margins and diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items, including those items noted under “2022 Full-Year Guidance.” Altria’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of Altria’s underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis. Altria’s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate. Altria’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. Altria’s management uses adjusted financial measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. These adjusted financial measures are not consistent with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of historical adjusted financial measures to corresponding GAAP measures are provided in this release.

Altria uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in ABI and Cronos and reports its share of ABI’s and Cronos’s results using a one-quarter lag because ABI’s and Cronos’s results are not available in time to record them in the concurrent period. The one-quarter reporting lag for ABI and Cronos does not affect Altria’s cash flows. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Altria elected to account for its investment in JUUL under the fair value option. Prior to this date, Altria accounted for its investment in JUUL as an investment in an equity security.

At December 31, 2021 Altria’s reportable segments are (i) smokeable products, including combustible cigarettes and cigars manufactured and sold by PM USA and Middleton, respectively, and (ii) oral tobacco products, including MST and snus products manufactured and sold by USSTC, and oral nicotine pouches sold by Helix. On October 1, 2021, UST LLC sold its Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. (Ste. Michelle) business. Prior to October 1, 2021, wine produced and/or sold by Ste. Michelle was a reportable segment. Results for innovative

tobacco products and PMCC are included in “All Other.” Comparisons are to the corresponding prior-year period unless otherwise stated.
