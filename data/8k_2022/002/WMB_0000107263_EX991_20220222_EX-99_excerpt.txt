CEO Perspective

Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, made the following comments:

“Williams broke records in contracted transmission capacity, natural gas gathering volumes and financial results in 2021, including 10% higher Adjusted EBITDA for the year, reflecting growth across our three major business segments as well as strong contributions from our upstream JV operations. We surpassed our financial guidance, even after raising it twice during the year, and we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, adding to our track record of financial stability.

“In addition to record financial and operational success in 2021, we received top ESG rankings for the midstream sector and won a prestigious award for industry leadership. We also kicked off a multi-year modernization and emissions reduction program across our transmission network as part of our long-term commitment to safe, reliable and environmentally friendly operations. Furthermore, we expanded our efforts to invest in new energy ventures that will keep Williams at the forefront of technology changes within the midstream natural gas industry. 

“This tremendous momentum has set the pace for Williams to execute against our vision to provide the best transport, storage and delivery solutions for reliable, low-cost, low-carbon energy. We expect strong natural gas market fundamentals and steadfast project execution to drive additional growth for our business in 2022, and we are extremely well positioned to continue serving the growing need for clean energy far into the future."

GAAP Measures

•Fourth-quarter 2021 net income increased by $506 million compared to the prior year reflecting $66 million of increased earnings from our new upstream operations, $58 million higher service revenues, and $45 million of higher joint venture earnings in the Northeast G&P segment. The higher service revenues include $30 million from Transco expansion projects and a $24 million increase at Northeast G&P. In addition, we had a $188 million net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives, primarily in our Sequent business, partially offset by $93 million of higher operating and administrative expense including 

2

the impact of higher incentive and equity compensation expense as well as the absence of a prior year benefit associated with a change in employee benefit policy. Beyond these business drivers, we also benefited from the absence of $326 million of impairment-related impacts, partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes.

•The net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives includes $168 million related to derivative contracts within the Sequent segment that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Sequent can experience significant earnings volatility from the fair value accounting required for the derivatives used to hedge a portion of the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio. However, the unrealized fair value measurement gains and losses are offset by valuation changes in the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio, which is not recognized until the underlying transportation and storage transaction occurs.

•Full-year 2021 net income improved by $1.3 billion over the prior year, reflecting $223 million of higher commodity margins, $181 million of increased earnings from equity-method investments within Northeast G&P, $111 million of earnings from upstream operations acquired this year, and $77 million of higher service revenues, partially offset by a $109 million net unrealized losses on commodity derivatives, $74 million of higher depreciation and amortization expense and $206 million of higher operating and administrative costs, including the previously described impacts of incentive and equity compensation expense and the change in employee benefit policy. The higher service revenues reflect $106 million from Transco expansion projects and $63 million in Northeast G&P reduced by lower West service revenues. The improvement over last year also reflects the absence of $1.5 billion in pre-tax charges in 2020 related to impairments of certain assets, equity-method investments, goodwill and goodwill at an equity investee, of which $65 million was attributable to noncontrolling interests. The provision for income taxes changed unfavorably by $432 million primarily due to higher pre-tax income.

•The severe winter weather impact in February 2021 and the associated effect on commodity prices is estimated to have had a net favorable impact on our pre-tax results of approximately $77 million, primarily within our commodity margins and results from upstream operations.

•Cash flow from operations for both the fourth quarter and full-year periods of 2021 increased as compared to 2020 primarily due to higher operating results exclusive of non-cash charges. The full-year period also benefited from higher distributions from equity-method investments and favorable changes in net working capital, partially offset by higher margin deposits associated with increasing derivative liabilities. Working capital changes compared to the prior year benefited from the absence of $284 million of rate refunds paid in 2020 associated with Transco's completed rate case.

Non-GAAP Measures

•Fourth-quarter 2021 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $147 million over the prior year, driven by the previously described benefits from upstream operations and service revenues, as well as $86 million higher proportional EBITDA from Northeast G&P equity-method investments, partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs. 

•Full-year Adjusted EBITDA increased by $530 million over the prior year, driven by the previously described benefits from commodity margins, upstream operations and service revenues, as well as $209 million higher proportional EBITDA from Northeast G&P equity-method investments, partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs. 

•Fourth-quarter 2021 Adjusted Income improved by $94 million over the prior year, while full-year Adjusted Income improved by $325 million. Increases for both comparative periods were driven by the previously described impacts to net income, adjusted to remove the effects of net unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, the absence of 2020 impairments, amortization of certain assets from the Sequent acquisition, and accelerated depreciation on decommissioning assets.

•Fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 Available Funds From Operations increased by $62 million and $435 million, respectively, compared to the prior periods primarily due to higher operating results exclusive of non-cash charges, while the full-year period also benefited from higher distributions from equity-method investments.

Form 10-K.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Transmission & Gulf of Mexico

•Fourth-quarter and full-year Modified and Adjusted EBITDA improved compared to the prior year, as higher service revenues related to recent expansion projects were partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs. The full-year period also benefited from higher commodity margins and proportional EBITDA from the Discovery equity-method investment. Modified EBITDA for both periods also benefited from the absence of a $170 million 2020 impairment charge, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

Northeast G&P

•Fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher gathering volumes from equity-method investments and the benefit of our increased ownership in Blue Racer Midstream, acquired in November 2020. Modified EBITDA for both periods also benefited from the absence of our share of 2020 impairments at equity-method investees, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

•Gross gathering volumes for fourth-quarter 2021, including 100% of operated equity-method investments, increased by 5% over the same period in 2020.

West

•Fourth-quarter 2021 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year as the benefits of higher gathering volumes and rates were more than offset by the absence of certain volume deficiency payments. Modified EBITDA also benefited from a $20 million net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

•Full-year 2021 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year primarily due to an estimated $55 million net favorable impact from the February 2021 severe winter weather, $96 million of higher commodity margins, and lower operating and administrative costs. These favorable changes were partially offset by lower Barnett deferred revenue amortization and the absence of a deficiency fee, as well as lower proportional EBITDA from equity method investments driven by reduced transportation volumes on Overland Pass Pipeline.  

Sequent

•Fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA reflect the results of this business acquired in July 2021. The fourth-quarter Modified EBITDA was driven by a $168 million net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. The full-year Modified EBITDA loss includes a $109 million net unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. The related derivative contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Sequent can experience significant earnings volatility from the fair value accounting required for the derivatives used to hedge a portion of the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio. However, the unrealized fair value measurement gains and losses are offset by valuation changes in the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio, which is not recognized until the underlying transportation and storage transaction occurs.

4

Other

•Fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA improved compared to the prior year primarily due to oil and gas producing properties acquired this year. The year-to-date increase reflects an estimated $22 million attributable to the February 2021 severe winter weather. Modified EBITDA for both periods also reflects the absence of a $24 million loss contingency accrual in 2020, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

2022 Financial Guidance

The company expects 2022 Adjusted EBITDA between $5.6 billion and $6 billion. The company also expects 2022 growth capex between $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion and maintenance capex between $650 million and $750 million, which includes capital for emissions reduction and modernization initiatives. Importantly, Williams anticipates achieving a leverage ratio midpoint of 3.8x, which along with expectations to generate positive free cash flow (after capex and dividends), will allow it to retain financial flexibility. Dividend guidance increased 3.7% on an annualized basis to $1.70 in 2022 from $1.64 in 2021.

Non-GAAP Measures

This news release and accompanying materials may include certain financial measures – adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (“earnings”), adjusted earnings per share, available funds from operations and dividend coverage ratio – that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC.

Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified EBITDA of equity-method investments.

Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Such items are excluded from net income to determine adjusted income and adjusted earnings per share. Management believes this measure provides investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations.

Available funds from operations is defined as cash flow from operations excluding the effect of changes in working capital and certain other changes in noncurrent assets and liabilities, reduced by preferred dividends and net distributions to noncontrolling interests. 

This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of assets and the cash that the business is generating.

Neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, nor available funds from operations are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
