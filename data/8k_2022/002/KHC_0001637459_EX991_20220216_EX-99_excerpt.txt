Q4 2021 Financial Summary

•Net sales decreased 3.3 percent versus the year-ago period to $6.7 billion, including a negative 7.3 percentage point impact from acquisitions and divestitures and a favorable 0.1 percentage point impact from currency. Net sales versus the comparable 2019 period increased 2.6 percent, including a favorable 0.2 percentage point impact from currency and despite a negative 7.0 percentage point impact from acquisitions and divestitures. Organic Net Sales(1) increased 3.9 percent versus the prior year period and 9.4 percent versus the comparable 2019 period, with growth versus 2019 negatively impacted by 1.6 percentage points from exiting the McCafé licensing agreement. Pricing was up 3.8 percentage points versus the prior year period with growth across each reporting segment that primarily reflected inflation-justified price increases in foodservice and retail channels. Volume/mix was essentially flat versus the year-ago period as benefits from continued recovery in foodservice channels were offset by a combination of comparisons with extraordinary COVID-19-related retail demand in 2020 and temporary supply constraints.

•Net income/(loss) decreased to a loss of $255 million primarily driven by non-cash impairment losses of $1.3 billion, largely due to the impairment of the Kraft brand following the closing of the Cheese Transaction(2), higher interest expense due to one-time debt extinguishment costs, lower Adjusted EBITDA, as well as unrealized losses on commodity hedges in the current year period compared to unrealized gains on commodity hedges in the prior year period. These factors were partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and favorable changes in other expense/(income) versus the prior year period. Net income/(loss) decreased versus the comparable 2019 period primarily driven by non-cash impairment losses as well. Adjusted EBITDA(1) decreased versus the year-ago period to $1.6 billion and increased versus the comparable 2019 period. Current year Adjusted EBITDA performance included an unfavorable impact from divestitures of approximately 3.5 percentage points against each of the 2020 and 2019 periods. Excluding a favorable 0.2 percentage point impact from currency, year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA also reflected higher commodity costs, including key commodity(3) and packaging costs, as well as inflation in procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs. These factors were partially offset by Organic Net Sales gains and operating efficiencies.

•Diluted EPS decreased to a loss of $0.21, down 125.0 percent versus the prior year, driven by the net income/(loss) factors discussed above. Adjusted EPS(1) decreased to $0.79, down 1.3 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower Adjusted EBITDA that more than offset lower taxes on adjusted earnings, lower interest expense, and favorable changes in other expense/(income) versus the prior year period.

•Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.4 billion in 2021, up 8.8 percent versus the year-ago period, primarily driven by one-time proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion from the sale of licenses in connection with the Cheese Transaction, favorable changes in accounts payable compared to the prior year, largely due to favorable payment terms, and lower cash outflows for inventories. These impacts were partially offset by higher cash tax payments on divestitures in 2021 related to the divestiture of the Company's nuts business, higher cash outflows for variable compensation in 2021 compared to 2020, higher cash outflows from increased promotional activity versus the prior year period, and lower Adjusted EBITDA. Free Cash Flow was $4.5 billion in 2021, up 2.9 percent versus the comparable prior year period due to higher net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by higher capital expenditures versus the prior year period.

Outlook

The Company expects to deliver strong financial performance in 2022. The Company currently expects a low-single-digit percentage increase in 2022 Organic Net Sales(4) versus the prior year period, reflecting continued stronger consumption versus pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted EBITDA(4) is expected to be in the range of $5.8 billion to $6.0 billion, reflecting a 53rd week in 2022, the impact of divestitures versus the prior year, strong Organic Net Sales as well as the Company's ongoing efforts to manage inflationary pressures as it continues to invest in long-term growth.

End Notes

(1)Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see discussion of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations at the end of this press release for more information.

(2)In November 2021, the Company closed a transaction with an affiliate of Groupe Lactalis that included the sale of certain assets in the Company’s global cheese businesses as well as the grant of perpetual licenses for the Kraft and Velveeta brands for certain cheese products and a three-year transitional license for the Philadelphia brand (the “Cheese Transaction”).

(3)The Company's key commodities in the United States and Canada are dairy, meat, and coffee.

(4)Full year 2022 guidance for Organic Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA is provided on a non-GAAP basis only because certain information necessary to calculate the most comparable GAAP measure is unavailable due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and the future financial statement impact of such items impacting comparability, including, but not limited to, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, divestiture-related license income, restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, and equity award compensation expense, among other items. Therefore, as a result of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures without unreasonable effort.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The non-GAAP financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) that are presented in this press release.

To supplement the financial information provided, the Company has presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), net cash provided by/(used for) operating activities, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations. Management believes that presenting the Company's non-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company's results. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.

Organic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. The Company calculates the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which the Company calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.

7

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding restructuring activities); in addition to these adjustments, the Company excludes, when they occur, the impacts of divestiture-related license income (e.g., income related to the sale of licenses in connection with the Cheese Transaction), restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, and equity award compensation expense (excluding restructuring activities). The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis. The Company calculates the impact of currency on Adjusted EBITDA by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which it calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Adjusted EBITDA and Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA are tools that can assist management and investors in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations. In 2021, the Company revised the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to adjust for the impact of certain legal and regulatory matters arising outside the ordinary course of its business and divestiture-related license income, as management believes such matters, when they occur, do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations. 

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, and certain significant discrete income tax items (e.g., U.S. and non-U.S. tax reform), and including when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. The Company believes Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis. In 2021, the Company revised the definition of Adjusted EPS to adjust for the impact of certain legal and regulatory matters arising outside the ordinary course of its business and certain significant discrete income tax items beyond U.S. tax reform, as management believes such matters, when they occur, do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations. 

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by/(used for) operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company believes Free Cash Flow provides a measure of the Company's core operating performance, the cash-generating capabilities of the Company's business operations, and is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for debt repayments, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases, and other corporate purposes. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.

See the attached schedules for supplemental financial data, which includes the financial information, the non-GAAP financial measures and corresponding reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures for the relevant periods.
