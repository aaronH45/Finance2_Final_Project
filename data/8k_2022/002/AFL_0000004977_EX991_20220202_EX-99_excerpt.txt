Aflac Incorporated Announces Fourth Quarter Results,

Reports Fourth Quarter Net Earnings of $1.0 Billion,

Reiterates Increase in First Quarter Cash Dividend of 21.2%

COLUMBUS, Ga. - February 2, 2022 - Aflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL) today reported its fourth quarter results.

Total revenues were $5.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net earnings were $1.0 billion, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared with $951 million, or $1.35 per diluted share a year ago.

Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 included pretax adjusted net investment gains* of $246 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared with pretax adjusted net investment gains of $268 million, or $0.38 per diluted share a year ago, which are excluded from adjusted earnings*. The adjusted net investment gains were driven by an increase in the fair value of equity securities of $181 million, including a $198 million gain from Trupanion; net gains from certain derivatives and foreign currency activities of $39 million; and net gains from sales and redemptions of $34 million, partially offset by an increase in the allowance associated with the company's estimate of current expected credit losses (CECL) of $7 million.

Adjusted earnings included variable investment income from alternative investments, which was $0.13 per share above return expectations. Adjusted earnings per diluted share* increased 19.6% to $1.28 in the quarter. The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate impacted adjusted earnings per diluted share by $0.05. 

For the full year of 2021, total revenues were down 0.2% to $22.1 billion, compared with $22.1 billion for the full year of 2020. Net earnings were $4.3 billion, or $6.39 per diluted share, compared with $4.8 billion, or $6.67 per diluted share, for the full year of 2020.

Shareholders’ equity excluding AOCI (or adjusted book value*) was $25.9 billion, or $39.65 per share at December 31, 2021, compared with $24.6 billion, or $35.56 per share, at December 31, 2020. The annualized adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact* in the fourth quarter was 13.6% and 16.1% for the full year. 

AFLAC JAPAN

In yen terms, Aflac Japan's net earned premiums were ¥319.3 billion for the quarter, or 4.3% lower than a year ago, mainly due to limited-pay products reaching paid-up status and constrained sales from the impact of pandemic conditions. Adjusted net investment income increased 16.8% to ¥87.7 billion, mainly due to higher alternative and floating rate income as well as lower hedge costs. Total adjusted revenues in yen declined 0.4% to ¥408.1 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings in yen for the quarter increased 17.9% on a reported basis to ¥100.9 billion, due to continued favorable claim trends and higher net investment income. Pretax adjusted earnings increased 12.9% on a currency-neutral basis. The pretax adjusted profit margin for the Japan segment was 24.7%, compared with 20.9% a year ago. The increase in the profit margin is largely due to continued improvements in incurred benefits and adjusted net investment income.

For the full year, net earned premiums in yen were ¥1.3 trillion, or 3.9% lower than a year ago. Adjusted net investment income increased 17.6% to ¥333.0 billion. Total adjusted revenues in yen were down 0.2% to ¥1.6 trillion. Pretax adjusted earnings were ¥412.1 billion, or 18.5% higher than a year ago. 

In dollar terms, net earned premiums decreased 12.1% to $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter. Adjusted net investment income increased 6.9% to $771 million. Total adjusted revenues declined by 8.5% to $3.6 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings increased 8.0% to $887 million. 

For the full year, net earned premiums in dollars were $11.9 billion, or 6.4% lower than a year ago. Adjusted net investment income increased 14.0% to $3.0 billion. Total adjusted revenues were down 2.9% to $14.9 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $3.8 billion, or 15.0% higher than a year ago.

For the quarter, total new annualized premium sales (sales) increased 1.1% to ¥14.6 billion, or $128 million, reflecting a gradual increase in face-to-face sales activity following an intermittent recovery in pandemic conditions. For the full year, total sales increased 7.7% to ¥54.8 billion, or $499 million. 

AFLAC U.S.

Aflac U.S. net earned premiums declined 1.3% to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, mainly due to constrained sales over the past year. Adjusted net investment income increased 8.2% to $197 million primarily due to higher variable net investment income. As a result, total adjusted revenues were up 0.1% to $1.6 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $261 million, 39.6% higher than a year ago, which was driven by lower incurred benefits and higher adjusted net investment income. The pretax adjusted profit margin for the U.S. segment was 16.1%, compared with 11.6% a year ago. 

For the full year, net earned premiums declined 2.5% to $5.6 billion. Adjusted net investment income increased 7.0% to $754 million. Total adjusted revenues were down 1.2% to $6.5 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion, or 16.6% higher than a year ago.

Aflac U.S. sales increased 19.6% in the quarter to $464 million. For the full year, total new sales increased 16.9% to $1.3 billion. Sales for both the quarter and the year reflected improvements from prior year periods that were more severely impacted by pandemic conditions. 

CORPORATE AND OTHER 

For the quarter, total adjusted revenues decreased 138.0% to a negative $35 million, due to a $117 million decline in adjusted net investment income, primarily due to the impact of federal tax credit investments as tax benefits are recognized in a corresponding lower income tax expense; lower yields; and lower hedge income. Pretax adjusted earnings were a loss of $155 million, compared with a loss of $47 million a year ago, primarily reflecting lower adjusted net investment income.

For the full year, total adjusted revenues decreased 54.4% to $175 million, primarily due to a $193 million decrease in adjusted net investment income. Pretax adjusted earnings were a loss of $298 million, compared with a loss of $115 million a year ago.

DIVIDEND

The board of directors declared the first quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, payable on March 1, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2022. 

OUTLOOK 

Commenting on the company’s results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "The company generated strong earnings for the year, largely supported by the continuation of low benefit ratios associated with pandemic conditions and better-than-expected returns from alternative investments. While we saw improvements in the quarter for both the United States and Japan, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic in the face of ongoing pandemic conditions.

"Looking at our operations in Japan, I am encouraged by the 7.7% sales increase for the year, which included the first quarter introduction of our medical product EVER Prime and the September launch of our new nursing care product. However, we continued to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan, including various states of emergency that may impact our ability to meet face-to-face with customers, which continues to be key to a recovery in sales. 

"In the U.S., I am pleased with the 16.9% sales increase for the year. At the same time, I am encouraged by reports of new small business formation and the resiliency of larger businesses. Our sales in the fourth quarter reflect increased face-to-face sales opportunities. We continue to work toward reinforcing our position and generating stronger sales in 2022, realizing we may face headwinds from pandemic conditions. 

"As always, we are committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. This includes maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders in both the U.S. and Japan. It goes without saying that we treasure our record of dividend growth. Coming off our 39th consecutive year of dividend increases, I am pleased with the board’s decision to increase the quarterly dividend by 21.2% in the first quarter, as we announced in November. Our dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we remain in the market repurchasing shares with a tactical approach and focused on integrating the growth investments we have made in our platform. By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership."

NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This document includes references to the Company’s financial performance measures which are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) (non-U.S. GAAP). The financial measures exclude items that the Company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations.

Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. A significant portion of the Company’s business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, which results in foreign currency impact to earnings, cash flows and book value on a U.S. GAAP basis. Management evaluates the Company's financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor, respectively, cumulative currency impacts on book value and the currency-neutral operating performance over time. The average yen/dollar exchange rate is based on the published MUFG Bank, Ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (TTM).

 The company defines the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release as follows:

•Adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. Adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are the adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average outstanding shares (basic or diluted) for the period presented. The adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside management’s control. Adjusted revenues are U.S. GAAP total revenues excluding adjusted net investment gains and losses. Adjusted expenses are U.S. GAAP total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable but excluding any nonrecurring or other items not associated with the normal course of the Company’s insurance operations and that do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of the Company’s insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these financial measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company’s insurance business. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.

•Adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior-year period, which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by foreign currency exchange rate changes. Adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact important because a significant portion of the Company's business is conducted in Japan and foreign exchange rates are outside management’s control; therefore, the Company believes it is important to understand the impact of translating foreign currency (primarily Japanese yen) into U.S. dollars. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.

•Adjusted return on equity is adjusted earnings divided by average shareholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Management uses adjusted return on equity to evaluate the financial performance of the Company’s insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of this financial measure is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company’s insurance business. The Company considers adjusted return on equity important as it excludes components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity is return on average equity (ROE) as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders’ equity.

•Adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding the current period foreign currency impact divided by average shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI. The Company considers adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact important as it excludes changes in foreign currency and components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is ROE as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders’ equity.

•Amortized hedge costs/income represent costs/income incurred or recognized as a result of using foreign currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign exchange risks in the Company's Japan segment or in Corporate and other. These amortized hedge costs/ income are estimated at the inception of the derivatives based on the specific terms of each contract and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. The Company believes that amortized hedge costs/income measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. There is no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for amortized hedge costs/ income.

•Adjusted book value is the U.S. GAAP book value (representing total shareholders’ equity), less AOCI as recorded on the U.S. GAAP balance sheet. Adjusted book value per common share is adjusted book value at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share important as they exclude AOCI, which fluctuates due to market movements that are outside management’s control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.

•Adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses is adjusted book value plus unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses. Adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses per common share is adjusted book value plus unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses, and its related per share financial measure, important as they exclude certain components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control; however, it includes the impact of foreign currency as a result of the significance of Aflac’s Japan operation. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses and adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.

•Adjusted net investment income is net investment income adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, and ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are reclassified from net investment gains and losses to net investment income. The Company considers adjusted net investment income important because it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the costs and income associated with the Company’s investments and related hedging strategies. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment income is net investment income. 

•Adjusted net investment gains and losses are net investment gains and losses adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are both reclassified to net investment income, and iii) the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable, which is reclassified to interest expense as a component of total adjusted expenses. The Company considers adjusted net investment gains and losses important as it represents the remainder amount that is considered outside management’s control, while excluding the components that are within management’s control and are accordingly reclassified to net investment income and interest expense. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment gains and losses is net investment gains and losses.

1 U.S. GAAP ROE is calculated by dividing net earnings (annualized) by average shareholders' equity. 

2 See separate reconciliation of net income to adjusted earnings.

3 Impact of foreign currency is calculated by restating all foreign currency components of the income statement to the weighted average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior year period. The impact is the difference of the restated adjusted earnings compared to reported adjusted earnings. For comparative purposes, only current period income is restated using the weighted average prior period exchange rate, which eliminates the foreign currency impact for the current period. This allows for equal comparison of this financial measure.
