Details of comparable segment operating earnings, business consolidation activities, business segment descriptions and other non-comparable items can be found in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that accompany this news release. References to volume data represent units shipped. 

“We delivered a strong finish to 2021 and returned approximately $950 million to shareholders after deploying $1.7 billion of capital expenditures to support our growth during the year. Underlying demand for Ball’s sustainable aluminum packaging portfolio and innovative aerospace technologies continues to outpace supply. Our teams executed at a high level to complete significant capital projects on time and on budget to serve accelerating customer demand in 2022 and beyond. During the fourth quarter, the company increased comparable earnings per diluted share by 20 percent compared to fourth quarter 2020, initiated additional cost recovery mechanisms and continued to hire talent and build back finished goods inventory to position the company for long-term growth despite challenges associated with the pandemic, natural disasters and global supply chain disruptions,” said John A. Hayes, chairman and chief executive officer.

Driven by our Drive for 10 vision, EVA discipline, ownership mindset and incredible workforce, we are well positioned to meaningfully grow our long-term diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars, cash from operations and return significant value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in 2022 and beyond,” said Daniel W. Fisher, president.

Beverage Packaging, North and Central America

Beverage packaging, North and Central America, comparable segment operating earnings for full-year 2021 were $681 million on sales of $5.9 billion compared to $683 million on sales of $5.1 billion in 2020. For the fourth quarter 2021, comparable segment operating earnings were $162 million on sales of $1.5 billion compared to $139 million on sales of $1.3 billion during the same period in 2020. Year-over-year sales reflect higher shipments, the contractual pass through of higher aluminum costs and improved price/mix. 

Full-year comparable segment operating earnings were flat and reflect 4 percent segment volume growth offset by the impact of non-aluminum inflationary costs, operational inefficiencies from persistent supply chain disruptions and $42 million of startup costs associated with opening three new multi-line plants capable of producing at least 8 billion units of incremental beverage can and end capacity entering 2022. 

Fourth quarter comparable segment operating earnings increased 17 percent versus the same period in 2020. Volume growth of 5 percent, and the benefits from new manufacturing capacity, contractual terms, recent non-aluminum cost recovery initiatives, improved finished goods inventory levels and specialty growth more than offset startup costs, the impacts of supply chain and dunnage tightness and weather-related plant disruptions during the quarter. 

Demand for aluminum beverage packaging continues to outstrip supply across North America. In addition to the company’s new Glendale, Arizona, and Pittston, Pennsylvania, beverage can manufacturing facilities becoming operational in 2021, the company will initiate construction of new beverage can manufacturing facilities in North Las Vegas, Nevada, and Concord, North Carolina, in 2022 and 2023, respectively, to serve long-term committed volume with global and regional strategic customers serving all beverage categories. 

​

Beverage Packaging, EMEA

Beverage packaging, EMEA, comparable segment operating earnings for full-year 2021 were $452 million on sales of $3.5 billion compared to $354 million on sales of $2.9 billion in 2020. Fourth quarter comparable segment operating earnings were $103 million on sales of $870 million compared to $106 million on sales of $768 million during the same period in 2020. Year-over-year sales reflect higher shipments and the contractual pass through of higher aluminum costs.

​

Full-year comparable segment operating earnings increased 28 percent and reflect 8 percent segment volume growth, higher specialty mix and strong year-over-year consumption trends across Europe. Fourth quarter comparable segment operating earnings were relatively flat versus the same period in 2020 and reflect 6 percent volume growth offset by unfavorable euro earnings translation, tight labor and raw material conditions impacting certain customer filling locations.

Packaging mix shift to sustainable aluminum cans continues, and demand is outstripping supply. Intermittent supply chain disruptions across the region were effectively managed throughout the year. Contractual provisions and management practices are also in place to minimize potential impacts during the ongoing escalating cost environment. Successfully executed line speed ups in 2021, and greenfield projects in the U.K., Russia and Czech Republic during 2022, will enable further volume and operating earnings growth and are supported by long-term contracts. 

​

Beverage Packaging, South America

Beverage packaging, South America, comparable segment operating earnings for full-year 2021 were $348 million on sales of $2.0 billion compared to $280 million on sales of $1.7 billion in 2020. Fourth quarter comparable segment operating earnings were $103 million on sales of $615 million compared to $107 million on sales of $529 million during the same period in 2020. Year-over-year fourth quarter sales reflect the contractual pass through of higher aluminum costs and higher shipments.

Full-year comparable segment operating earnings increased 24 percent and reflect 3 percent segment volume growth, favorable price/mix and contractual provisions for timely pass through of higher non-aluminum input costs offset by the impact of unfavorable weather conditions and operational inefficiencies associated with storm damage to a facility during the second half. Fourth quarter comparable segment operating earnings were relatively flat versus the same period in 2020 and reflect 3 percent volume growth offset by unfavorable customer product mix. In Brazil, underlying demand for sustainable aluminum packaging remains strong despite unseasonably cool and rainy weather conditions during the busy fourth quarter summer selling season. 

To support long-term contracted volume growth and can-filling investments across South America, the company’s new beverage can manufacturing facility in Frutal, Brazil, will start up its second line during the first quarter of 2022, and additional investments across our remaining South American footprint will continue.

​

Aerospace

Aerospace comparable segment operating earnings for full-year 2021 were $169 million on sales of $1.9 billion compared to $153 million on sales of $1.7 billion in 2020. For the fourth quarter, comparable segment operating earnings were $54 million on sales of $530 million compared to $39 million on sales of $420 million during the same period in 2020. Backlog ended the quarter at $2.5 billion and contracts won, but not yet booked into backlog, was $5.0 billion.

​

Full-year and fourth quarter segment operating earnings reflect moderation in the inefficiencies created from certain customer supply-chain disruptions and solid program execution. During the quarter, the Ball-built NASA Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) spacecraft was successfully launched. The IXPE astrophysics mission will provide unprecedented insight into how the universe works with a goal of probing the origin and destiny of our universe, including the nature of black holes, dark energy, dark matter and gravity. Also, during the quarter and following decades of collaboration among numerous industry partners, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope launched on Christmas Day. Ball-built optics and mirror systems will enable Webb to detect light from the first stars and galaxies.

The company continues to win defense, climate change and Earth-monitoring contracts to provide mission-critical programs and technologies to U.S. government, defense, intelligence, and reconnaissance and surveillance customers. Hiring to support future growth and multiple projects to expand manufacturing capacity, test capabilities, engineering, and support workspace were successfully completed in 2021.

​

Non-reportable

In addition to undistributed corporate expenses, the results for the company’s global aluminum aerosol business, beverage can manufacturing facilities in India, Saudi Arabia and Myanmar and investments in the company’s aluminum cup business continue to be reported in other non-reportable. 

Full-year results reflect higher year-over-year undistributed corporate expenses and marketing costs associated with the aluminum cup national retail launch and its return to venues and stadiums across the United States offset by stronger year-over-year performance achieved in the aluminum aerosol business and other non-reportable beverage can manufacturing facilities. Fourth quarter results reflect lower year-over-year undistributed corporate expenses driven by lower benefit costs and improved performance in the non-reportable beverage can manufacturing facilities. During the quarter, the company’s global aluminum aerosol customers continued to pursue sustainable personal care packaging solutions including the company’s new Infinity aluminum bottle and refillable aluminum bottles for new categories.

​

Outlook

“The company is well-positioned for long-term growth, cost/price recovery and increasing return of value to shareholders. Our businesses’ resiliency, financial strength and ability to effectively manage the business during evolving economic environments reflects who we are and have always been. We look forward to reaping higher returns on newly commissioned investments, pursuing additional organic growth opportunities backed by long-term contracts with global strategic partners and increasing the return of value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2022,” said Scott C. Morrison, executive vice president and chief financial officer. 

“Ball is stronger than ever. Despite the adversity we and others have endured, the optimism and resiliency of our team to get packaging products out the door and missions launched into space has allowed us to perform well, take care of one another and create an even brighter future for our company. Our Drive for 10 vision, enduring culture, talented team, capital allocation discipline and strong demand for our sustainable packaging and technologies will enable our ability to replicate our strong performance for decades to come. In 2022 and beyond, we look forward

to growing our cash from operations, EVA dollars, returning even more capital to our shareholders and exceeding our long-term diluted earnings per share growth goal of at least 10 to 15%,” Fisher said.

​

Beverage packaging, North and Central America: Consists of operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico that manufacture and sell aluminum beverage containers.

​

Beverage packaging, EMEA: Consists of operations in numerous countries throughout Europe, including Russia, as well as Egypt and Turkey, that manufacture and sell aluminum beverage containers throughout those regions.

​

Beverage packaging, South America: Consists of operations in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Chile that manufacture and sell aluminum beverage containers throughout most of South America.

​

The company also has investments in operations in Guatemala, Panama, the U.S. and Vietnam that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. 

​

On January 26, 2022, Ball sold its remaining equity method investment in Ball Metalpack to Sonoco, a global provider of consumer, industrial, healthcare and protective packaging for approximately $300 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments. The carrying value of the investment was zero, therefore the proceeds, net of adjustments, will be reported as a pre-tax gain in business consolidation and other activities in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of earnings. Cash proceeds will be presented in business dispositions in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

​

In the third quarter of 2021, Ball sold its minority-owned investment in South Korea. Consideration for the transaction was cash of $120 million, of which $110 million has been received and is presented in business dispositions within cash flows from investing activities in Ball’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The remaining $10 million will be received on or before December 31, 2022, and is presented in other current assets on Ball’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

2. Non-U.S. GAAP Measures

​

Non-U.S. GAAP Measures – Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation. They should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Presentations of earnings and cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP are available in the company's earnings releases and quarterly and annual regulatory filings. Information reconciling forward-looking U.S. GAAP measures to non-U.S. GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. We have not provided guidance for the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to certain special items, including restructuring charges, business consolidation and other costs, gains and losses related to acquisition and divestiture of businesses, the ultimate outcome of certain legal or tax proceedings and other non-comparable items. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could be material to our results computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

​

Comparable Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Comparable EBITDA), Comparable Operating Earnings, Comparable Net Earnings, Comparable Diluted Earnings Per Share and Net Debt – Comparable EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, business consolidation and other non-comparable costs. Comparable Operating Earnings is earnings before interest, taxes, business consolidation and other non-comparable costs. Comparable Net Earnings is net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation before business consolidation and other non-comparable costs after tax. Comparable Diluted Earnings Per Share is Comparable Net Earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We use Comparable EBITDA, Comparable Operating Earnings, Comparable Net Earnings, and Comparable Diluted Earnings Per Share internally to evaluate the company's operating performance. Net Debt is total debt less cash and cash equivalents, which are derived directly from the company’s financial statements. Ball management uses Net Debt to Comparable EBITDA and Comparable EBITDA to interest expense as metrics to monitor the credit quality of Ball Corporation.
