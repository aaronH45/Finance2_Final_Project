Section 7 - Regulation FD

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

As previously disclosed, on July 16, 2021, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (the "MA DPU"), in response to a petition filed by National Grid USA ("National Grid"), issued an order granting a waiver (the "Waiver Order") of the MA DPU's jurisdiction over National Grid's sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Narragansett Electric Company, to PPL Rhode Island Holdings, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PPL Corporation (the "Company"). On December 31, 2021, the Attorney General of Massachusetts filed a motion with the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (the "Supreme Judicial Court") to stay the Waiver Order pending appellate review.

On February 24, 2022, a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court issued an order granting a temporary stay of the Waiver Order until further order of the Court. The Company currently expects that there will be a further order on the stay before the full Supreme Judicial Court considers the substance of the Attorney General of Massachusetts' appeal. If the Supreme Judicial Court maintains the stay until it decides the appeal, the Company remains confident that the Supreme Judicial Court will ultimately find that the MA DPU correctly issued the Waiver Order.

SIGNATURE

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
