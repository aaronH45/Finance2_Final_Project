Item 8.01. Other Events

In July 2021, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed a request with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) seeking a net electric rate increase of $343 million (or 12.4%). The total request reflects a $470 million increase, which includes $127 million of previously authorized costs currently recovered through various rider mechanisms. The request is based on a 10.0% return on equity (ROE), an equity ratio of 55.64%, a 2022 forecast test year, a rate base of $10.3 billion and impacts of a new depreciation study. A historical test year was filed with a revenue deficiency of $404 million, including a 10.5% ROE.

On Jan. 5, 2022, PSCo, the CPUC Staff and various intervenors filed a comprehensive unopposed settlement, which results in a net increase to retail electric rates of $177 million. The total change in base rates is $299 million, which includes $122 million of revenue previously collected through various rider mechanisms. 

The settlement is based on:

•A ROE of 9.3%.

•An equity ratio of 55.69%.

•A current 2021 test year, based on average rate base with the transfer of Cheyenne Ridge, Wildfire Mitigation Plan and Advanced Grid Intelligence and Security (AGIS) investments at year-end rate base.

•Approval of all of PSCo's proposed depreciation adjustments.

•Continuation of AGIS deferral including interest equivalent to PSCo's weighted average cost of capital once the balance exceeds $50 million.

•Continuation of the Wildfire Mitigation Plan deferral, with a debt return.

•Continuation of the property tax, qualified pension and non-qualified pension trackers.

Hearings to discuss the settlement are scheduled for January 2022. A CPUC decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 and rates will be effective April 2022.

Xcel Energy reaffirms its GAAP and ongoing 2022 earnings guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share.
