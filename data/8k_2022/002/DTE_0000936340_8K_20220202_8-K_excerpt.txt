Annual Incentive Plan

On February 2, 2022, the Organization and Compensation Committee (the O&C Committee) of the Board of Directors of DTE Energy Company (DTE Energy or the Company) approved 2022 performance measures, weightings and metrics under the Company's Annual Incentive Plan (AIP). 

The following table summarizes the annual measures for 2022 under the AIP for executive officers of the Company in determining their total annual incentive award:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Based on market comparisons, each officer position is assigned a target award expressed as a percentage of base salary. For 2022, targets for DTE Energy, DTE Electric and DTE Vantage’s named executive officers (executive officers who will appear in the summary compensation table of DTE Energy’s 2022 Proxy Statement) range from 75% to 125%, including Mr. Norcia, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. Award amounts paid to each AIP participant are determined as follows: (1) the executive's most recent year-end base salary is multiplied by an AIP target percentage to arrive at the target award; (2) the overall performance payout percentage, which can range from 0% to 200%, is determined based on final results compared to threshold, target and maximum levels for each objective; and (3) the target award is then multiplied by the performance payout percentage to arrive at the final award amount.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

On February 2, 2022, the O&C Committee approved 2024 performance measures, weightings and metrics for executive officers, including the named executive officers, under the DTE Energy Company Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The LTIP, which was approved by our shareholders, rewards long-term growth and profitability by providing a vehicle through which officers, other key employees and outside directors may receive stock based compensation. Stock-based compensation directly links individual performance with shareholder interests. Based on market comparisons, each officer position is assigned a target award expressed as a percentage of base salary. The target award may be modified by the O&C Committee and is then delivered in the form of restricted stock and performance shares. For long term incentive awards granted in 2022, which pay out in 2025, targets for these officers range from 175% to 510%, including the President and Chief Executive Officer.

Performance shares: Performance shares entitle the executive to receive a specified number of shares, or a cash payment equal to the fair market value of the shares, or a combination thereof, depending on the level of achievement of performance measures. The performance measurement period for the 2024 award is January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Payments earned under the 2024 award can range from 0% to 200% of target, based upon achievement of performance measures. The two measures and weightings for executive officers of DTE Energy and DTE Electric are: (1) total shareholder return vs. total shareholder return of peer group companies (80%) and (2) DTE Energy 3-year cumulative operating EPS (20%). The three measures and weightings for executive officers of DTE Vantage are: (1) total shareholder return vs. total shareholder return of peer group companies (40%); (2) DTE Energy 3-year cumulative operating EPS (10%) and (3) DTE Vantage long-range earnings growth (50%). Performance measure changes for the 2024 award include increasing the total shareholder return target and maximum to 55th and 80th percentile (versus 50th and 75th percentile), respectively, and introducing 3-year cumulative operating EPS as a new performance measure. These changes were made in support of DTE’s overall pay for performance philosophy.
