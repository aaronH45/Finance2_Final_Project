PINNACLE WEST REPORTS 2021 FULL-YEAR AND FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS

•Financial results reflect higher customer usage and robust customer growth of 2.2%

•2022 to serve as a “financial reset year” following recent rate case decision currently under appeal

•APS employees stay focused on operations and customer service improvements

•Company continues progress on Clean Energy Commitment

PHOENIX – Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $618.7 million, or $5.47 per diluted share, for full-year 2021. This result compares with net income of $550.6 million, or $4.87 per diluted share, in 2020. 

The 2021 results were positively impacted by an increase in revenue driven by higher customer usage and growth, higher transmission revenues, and the absence of a one-time charge related to a 2020 settlement. Other factors affecting the full-year results included higher pension and other postretirement non-service credits, and lower other expenses, partially offset by the effects of weather and higher depreciation and amortization expense.

“Though operational and financial rigor were key to our strong performance in 2021, we anticipate near-term headwinds due to the unfavorable outcome in our recent rate case,” said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and CEO Jeff Guldner. “As a result of that decision, 2022 will be a financial reset year with projections significantly lower than what we achieved in 2021.

“However, looking beyond this challenge, we believe in our ability to provide long-term value to both customers and shareholders by activating a well-thought-out strategy, working with regulators and stakeholders for a more constructive regulatory environment, deepening our renewed focus on customer satisfaction, and continuing our proven cost management efforts – all against the backdrop of Arizona’s incredible economic expansion.”

The company’s principal subsidiary, Arizona Public Service Co. (APS), benefited from robust customer growth of 2.2% in 2021, as people and businesses continued to move to Arizona, making the company’s service territory among the fastest growing in the nation. As a result, APS experienced weather normalized, year-over-year overall retail electricity sales growth of 4.2%. The company further anticipates steady customer growth in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 percent through 2024, with energy sales trending up at an even quicker pace. 

Higher Customer Usage, Growth Contributed to Fourth-Quarter Results 

For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2021, Pinnacle West reported consolidated net earnings attributable to common shareholders of $27.6 million, or $0.24 per diluted share. This result compares with a net loss of $19.4 million, or a loss of $0.17 per share, for the same period in 2020.

Main drivers for the quarter-over-quarter improvement were the previously mentioned settlement and shareholders’ portion of the coal community transition, both of which were booked in the fourth quarter of 2020. Mild weather was a factor in the 2021 fourth quarter, but was largely offset by an increase in revenue driven by higher customer usage and growth. 

Staying Focused on Serving Customers

Recognizing that creating customer value is inextricably linked to increasing shareholder value, APS employees remain focused on putting customers first and achieving an industry-leading best-in-class customer experience. Actions taken as part of this multi-year objective include incrementally improving the company’s J.D. Power (JDP) customer satisfaction ratings to the first-quartile of its peer set comprised of large investor-owned utilities.

The company demonstrated progress on that front in 2021, Guldner said. “Thanks to the hard work of our employees, our fourth-quarter JDP overall residential customer satisfaction score earned APS a third-quartile ranking, with year-over-year improvements in several key areas important to customers, including power quality and reliability, billing and payment, and customer call center performance.”

In 2021, APS call center associates answered about 76% of more than one million calls in 30 seconds or less. In addition to service and billing questions, advisors helped customers with crisis bill assistance, payment arrangements and other energy support programs.

Additionally, customers embraced APS’s digital platforms, where improvement efforts were a significant focus throughout 2021. Customers used the APS website and mobile app to complete 26 million-plus transactions and engagements in 2021 – a massive 53% increase over the prior year. This increase was reflected in customers’ ratings of the APS app, which has earned more than “4 stars” on both the Apple App Store and Google Play.

APS also was named a 2021 Business Customer Champion by international market research firm Escalent, which recognized the company as one of the top performing electric utilities in the nation for brand trust, product experience, service satisfaction and customer effort score for business customers.

Advancing Arizona’s Clean Energy Future

Following the second-year anniversary of its Clean Energy Commitment, the company continues to advance its goal of providing customers with 100% clean, carbon-free electricity by 2050 – while taking the necessary steps to maintain reliability and affordable prices for customers.

Since its initial announcement in early 2020, APS has procured nearly 1,400 megawatts of additional clean energy and storage – all of which will be in service for APS customers no later than 2024. 

“We’ve made solid progress on our Clean Energy Commitment, but much work remains,” said Guldner. 

“These substantial capital investments not only are vital to our transition away from coal and into a clean energy future, but they are also essential resources designed to help us keep pace with Arizona’s tremendous growth at the same time that electricity capacity markets are tightening across the entire West.”

The company’s clean energy goals and progress have been lauded by respected, independent third parties:

•For the third year in a row, global disclosure organization CDP recognized Pinnacle West for its action and leadership on climate change and water security, making it one of only two North American electric utility companies to achieve leadership scores in both categories;

•Finance research firm MSCI upgraded Pinnacle West’s Environmental, Social and Governance rating from “A” to “AA” as of April 2021; and

•Energy Intelligence named the company to its annual ranking of the world’s Top 100 Green Utilities for the third year in a row.

Financial Outlook

Following the unfavorable decision in APS’s recent rate case, which is currently being appealed, the company expects its 2022 full-year ongoing consolidated earnings will be within a range of $3.90 to $4.10 per diluted share on a weather-normalized basis.
