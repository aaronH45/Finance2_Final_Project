On January 6, 2022, the Exelon Corporation (“Exelon”) board of directors set the record and distribution dates for the distribution to Exelon’s shareholders of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Constellation Energy Corporation (“Constellation”), the entity which will own the competitive power generation and customer-facing retail energy business currently conducted by Exelon Generation Company, LLC ("Generation") once the previously announced separation of such businesses from Exelon’s six regulated electric and gas utilities business occurs. 

The Exelon board of directors declared a pro rata dividend of Constellation common stock to be made effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 1, 2022 (the “Distribution Date”), to Exelon’s shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 20, 2022 (the “Record Date”). On the Distribution Date, each Exelon shareholder of record as of the Record Date will receive a distribution of one share of Constellation common stock for every three shares of common stock of Exelon that the shareholder holds on the Record Date. Exelon shareholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Constellation common stock. The Distribution is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, which are described in Constellation’s Form 10 Registration Statement that was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on December 29, 2021.
