Company Key Metrics Summary  

2 Fourth-quarter revenue ($37.7 billion), net income ($12.3 billion) and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ($2.0 billion) all were up from 2020. So, too, was Ford’s performance against each of those measures for all of 2021. Full-year net income was $17.9 billion; company adjusted EBIT for the year was $10.0 billion. Adjusted EBIT was squarely within the guidance range of $9.6 billion to $10.6 billion that Ford provided on Oct. 27, after reclassifying its first-quarter 2021 gain on its investment in Rivian following Rivian’s Nov. 10 initial public offering. Automotive EBIT from outside North America was the company’s highest in four years. “Our team did a fantastic job working with partners to maximize component availability,” said John Lawler, Ford’s CFO. “We allocated those volumes to in-demand new vehicles like the Bronco (SUV) and Maverick (small pickup), profitable models like F-Series (trucks) and Transit, and customer orders.” For example, Ford worked with LG Energy Solution to improve battery supply for the Mustang Mach-E, expanding capacity three times over the past 10 months. Benefits from those increases will continue to accrue – to more than double originally contracted volumes by 2023. Meanwhile, Lawler said, full-year benefits from strong mix and net pricing, as well as lower warranty costs, more than offset the effects of the production losses and higher commodity costs. As a result, automotive EBIT of $7.4 billion and margin of 5.9% for 2021 were both significantly higher than in 2020. Ford ended the quarter with more than $36 billion in cash and $52 billion in liquidity. Both measures included the company’s investment in Rivian, which was valued at $10.6 billion at the end of 2021. At the close of trading on Feb. 2, the value was $6.6 billion. During the fourth quarter, Ford, consistent with its focus on creating value for shareholders, reinstated a regular dividend of 10 cents per share. The company’s balance sheet was further strengthened in the quarter by repurchasing and redeeming $7.6 billion in high-cost debt – also significantly reducing ongoing interest expenses. Around the same time, Ford introduced the North America auto industry’s first fully integrated sustainable financing framework, which spans both the auto business and Ford Credit. In November, Ford issued its first green bond, the $2.5 billion in proceeds from which are helping to fund BEV investments. Business Unit Highlights Ford’s business in North America vividly illustrates how the company is winning customers and reaping benefits from, according to Farley, “without question, the most exceptional product lineup I’ve seen in my 30-plus years in this industry.” The North America EBIT margin was 7.1% for the quarter and 8.4% for the year. In Q4, strong demand for Bronco and Maverick – the North America SUV and truck of the year, respectively – along with Mustang Mach-E and Bronco Sport contributed to a two-point U.S. share gain, to 15%, making Ford the country’s top-selling automaker. A semiconductor-related supply shortfall accounted for a quarterly EBIT loss in Europe. Nonetheless, the underlying trajectory of the business continues to improve. Ford Pro continues to figure prominently in the region, where Ford has now been the top commercial-vehicle brand for seven straight years. Ford gained CV share in both the fourth-  

3 quarter and full-year 2021 – the latter approaching 15% – and presently has a record order bank for its Transit vans. E-Transit will be launched there in early 2022. Ford Liive, the connected uptime system for commercial customers, is now available in nine European national markets. The application enabled an additional 28,000 days of vehicle availability in Q4. In China, Ford recorded a fourth-quarter operating loss, but is expected to improve profitability in 2022. Locally built Lincoln-brand vehicles are a huge part of Ford’s turnaround there, positioning the company to be a significant player in the world’s largest luxury car market. For the first time, Lincoln volumes in China were larger than those in the U.S. Full-year sales of Lincoln models were up nearly 50% from 2020, with the launch of the Lincoln Zephyr set for first-quarter 2022 and other new products from the brand forthcoming. Ford’s restructured, asset-light business unit in South America was again profitable and is now on a path toward growth. The company’s profitable International Markets Group, which operates in about 100 markets in Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere, is preparing to introduce a next-generation version of its Ranger midsize pickup later this year. Ford Credit, which will play a vital role in delivering exceptional customer value in the era of connected, zero-emission vehicles and services, again posted solid results in Q4, driving full- year earnings before taxes to $4.7 billion.  

4 Unfolding Ford+ Plan for Growth, Value Creation Ford is relentlessly adding to Ford+ capabilities for connectivity and EVs. Since the company last announced quarterly results on Oct. 27, developments have included: • The launch of VIIZR, a field-service tool for small-business customers built on the Salesforce platform • Introduction of Ford Pro Charging, to provide commercial customers of all sizes a complete, seamless solution for charging their electric vehicles • An initiative that allows plug-in EV owners in California to opt into carbon-neutral charging at home, a program of the California Air Resource Board’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard • A five-year agreement with Stripe, the economic-infrastructure company, to scale Ford’s always-on, e-commerce capabilities for customers • Formation of Canopy, a joint venture with ADT, for professional security monitoring and artificial intelligence-based camera technology that strengthens security of customers’ new and existing vehicles of all makes. • Creation of Ford Pro Intelligence, a cloud-based platform powering digital services to support commercial customer fleets. Outlook Strong customer appeal of Ford’s new vehicles is driving optimism about 2022 – the first full production year for the award-winning Bronco and Maverick. So are the E-Transit and, soon, the F-150 Lightning, which are joining the Mustang Mach-E in the company’s high-volume lineup of battery electric vehicles. Lawler said Ford expects full-year 2022 adjusted EBIT to be even stronger – $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, an increase of 15% to 25% over 2021. The high end of the adjusted EBIT range equates to a margin of 8% which, if achieved, would be one year earlier than the company’s previous target. Adjusted free cash flow for the year is expected to be $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. Underlying assumptions for 2022 include: • Significantly higher profits in North America, along with collective profitability in the rest of the world as the company benefits from its extensive global redesign • Continued variability in supplies of key components, with full-year vehicle wholesales nonetheless being up about 10% to 15%, with a high single- to low double-digit decline in Q1, reflecting supplier shortages related to COVID shutdowns and semiconductors • A strong pricing environment, though with a dynamic relationship between vehicle volumes and pricing • Increased commodity costs, along with possible inflationary effects on a broad range of other expenses • EBT from Ford Credit that remains strong, but lower than in 2021, and • Ongoing investment in the Ford+ plan. Ford plans to report its first-quarter 2022 financial results on Wednesday, April 27. # # #

 14 Non-GAAP Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures We use both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over- period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. • Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income / (Loss) attributable to Ford) – Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Pre-tax special items consist of (i) pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses, (ii) gains and losses on investments in equity securities, (iii) significant personnel expenses, dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, and (iv) other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. • Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income / (Loss) Margin) – Company Adjusted EBIT Margin is Company Adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. • Adjusted Earnings / (Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings / (Loss) Per Share) – Measure of Company’s diluted net earnings / (loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of the underlying run rate of our business. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings / (loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings / (loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. • Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) – Measure of Company’s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. • Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (FCF) (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By / (Used In) Operating Activities) – Measure of Company’s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit’s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Automotive and Mobility capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, global redesign (including separations), and other items that are considered operating cash flows under GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management’s assessment of the Company’s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company Adjusted FCF, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by / (used in) our operating activities. • Adjusted ROIC – Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit / (loss) after-cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. This calculation provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company’s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit / (loss) after-cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension / OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension / OPEB liability. Note: Calculated results may not sum due to rounding
