 Item 2.01.  

Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.  

As previously announced on January 4, 2022, Conduent Business Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Conduent Incorporated (“Conduent”), entered into a definitive agreement with Symplr Software, Inc., (“Buyer”) pursuant to which Conduent agreed to sell its Midas suite of patient safety, quality and advanced analytics solutions for an aggregate cash purchase price of $340 million, less certain indebtedness and adjusted for the difference between estimated working capital at closing and a negotiated working capital target (the “Business”). On February 8, 2022, Conduent successfully completed the sale of the Business. At closing, Buyer paid Conduent $321 million in cash, which is subject to settlement of customary post-closing adjustments. Conduent intends to use the net proceeds received from the sale of the Business for general corporate purposes, which may include funding capital expenditures and the repayment of indebtedness.  

 Item 8.01.  

Other Events.  

On February 9, 2022, Conduent issued a press release announcing the completion of the sale of the Business, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. The information contained in Item 8.01 and in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section.
