PPL Corporation Reports 2021 Earnings 

•Strategic repositioning remains on track. 

•Announces completion of the company's targeted $1 billion in share repurchases.

•Declares quarterly common stock dividend of $0.20 per share, based on existing business operations.

•Plans to provide comprehensive financial update, including updated annualized dividend and earnings forecasts, at investor day following anticipated final order on Narragansett acquisition.

 ALLENTOWN, Pa. (Feb. 18, 2022) – PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL) on Friday (2/18) reported a 2021 net loss of $1.48 billion, or $1.93 per share, compared with reported earnings of $1.47 billion, or $1.91 per share in 2020.

Adjusting for special items, 2021 earnings from ongoing operations (non-GAAP) were $806 million, or $1.05 per share, compared with $774 million, or $1.00 per share, a year ago. Special items were primarily attributable to discontinued operations associated with PPL's former U.K. utility business, a U.K. tax rate change and a loss on the early extinguishment of company debt.

"2021 was a significant year for PPL as we strategically repositioned the company for future growth and success. With the sale of our U.K. business and the planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric, we are extremely excited about the future for our company, our customers and our shareowners. And as we executed on our strategic transactions, we worked tirelessly to positively impact our customers' lives, deliver best-in-class energy service, and strengthen our communities," said PPL President and Chief Executive Officer Vincent Sorgi.

"We provided energy safely, reliably and affordably to our customers, achieving award-winning customer satisfaction in the process. We continued to lead the way in deploying innovative smart grid solutions to improve resilience and enable increased distributed energy resources, including renewables. In addition, we made significant progress in advancing our clean energy strategy. This included adopting a net-zero carbon emissions goal and significantly ramping up our investment in clean energy research and development to achieve our goal."

After completing the sale of its U.K. utility business in 2021, PPL remains focused on obtaining approval for the acquisition of The Narragansett Electric Company from National Grid. The company said it anticipates receiving a final order from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers by March 2022. PPL expects to provide a strategic update, including details on its plan to achieve competitive earnings per share growth, at an investor day following the decision. 

The company also announced that it completed its targeted $1 billion in share repurchases through Dec. 31, 2021. 

In addition, PPL announced a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.20 per share, payable April 1, 2022, to shareowners of record as of March 10, 2022. This will mark the company’s 305th consecutive quarterly dividend paid since 1946. The dividend payment is based on projected earnings per share from PPL's existing business operations in Pennsylvania and Kentucky and the company’s targeted payout ratio of 60%-65%. During its investor day, PPL plans to provide updated annualized dividend expectations and future dividend growth projections that are in line with earnings per share growth. 

PPL’s fourth-quarter 2021 reported earnings were $134 million, or $0.18 per share, compared with reported earnings of $290 million, or $0.38 per share, in 2020.

Adjusting for special items, primarily attributable to integration expenses associated with the planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric and discontinued operations associated with the U.K. utility business, fourth-quarter 2021 earnings from ongoing operations were $163 million, or $0.22 per share, compared with fourth-quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $181 million, or $0.23 per share.

Key Factors Impacting Earnings

In addition to the segment drivers outlined below, PPL's reported earnings in 2021 included special-item after-tax expenses of $2.29 billion, or $2.98 per share, primarily attributable to discontinued operations associated with the U.K. utility business, a U.K. tax rate change and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt. The special-item charges attributable to discontinued operations included a non-cash net loss on the sale of the U.K. utility business, primarily due to the realization of accumulated other comprehensive losses and forecasted federal taxes associated with the sale, partially offset by earnings from the operations of the U.K. utility business until completion of its sale on June 14, 2021. Reported earnings in 2020 included a special-item after-tax benefit of $695 million, or $0.91 per share, attributable to U.K. earnings that were reclassified to discontinued operations, partially offset primarily by a U.K. tax rate change.

 PPL's reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021 included special-item after-tax expenses of $29 million, or $0.04 per share, primarily attributable to integration expenses associated with the planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric and discontinued operations associated with the U.K. utility business.

Management utilizes “Earnings from Ongoing Operations” as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to reported earnings, or net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management’s view of PPL’s earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL’s management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.

Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items may include items such as:

•Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.

•Impairment charges.

•Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.

•Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.

•Significant losses on early extinguishment of debt.

•Other charges or credits that are, in management’s view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company’s ongoing operations.
