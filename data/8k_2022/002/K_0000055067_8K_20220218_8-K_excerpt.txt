Item 3.03. Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.

The information set forth below under Item 5.03 is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On February 18, 2022, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Kellogg Company (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Company’s Bylaws, effective immediately, to provide shareowners with a right to call a special meeting of shareowners. Pursuant to the amendment, a special meeting request may be made by shareowners who collectively own at least fifteen percent (15%) of the capital stock of the Company, provided the request is made in writing and includes, among other things, (i) a statement of the specific purpose of the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting; (ii) the information that would be required to be set forth in a shareowner’s notice of a nomination and/or notice of business proposed to be brought before a meeting pursuant to the Bylaws; (iii) an affidavit by each requesting shareowner stating the number of shares of capital stock owned of record by such shareowner; and (iv) an agreement to notify the Company promptly in the event of any disposition prior to the record date for the special meeting and that any disposition of shares prior to the special meeting shall be deemed a revocation of such special meeting request with respect to such disposed shares. Additionally, if none of the requesting shareowners or their duly authorized agents appear at the special meeting to present the matters for consideration as specified in the request, then the Company need not present such matters for a vote at such special meeting. The amendment also includes certain other clarifying and conforming changes.

The foregoing description of the amendment to the Company’s Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
