Item 8.01 Other Events. 

As previously reported, under News Corporation's (the "Company's") stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"), the Company is authorized to acquire from time to time up to $1 billion in the aggregate of the Company's outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Under the rules of the Australian Securities Exchange (the "ASX"), the Company is required to provide to the ASX, on a daily basis, disclosure of transactions pursuant to the Repurchase Program, if any. The Company also discloses information concerning the Repurchase Program in the Company's quarterly and annual reports.

Attached as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 are copies of the information provided to the ASX on the respective dates noted therein. Such information contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Company's intent to repurchase, from time to time, the Company's Class A common stock and Class B common stock. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to, among other factors, changes in the market price of the Company's stock, general market conditions, applicable securities laws and alternative investment opportunities, as well as the risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The "forward-looking statements" included in such information are made only as of the date of this report. We do not have and do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any "forward-looking statements" to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and we expressly disclaim any such obligation, except as required by law or regulation.
