2 SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Certain information in this presentation constitutes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are those not based on historical information, but rather relate to our outlook, future operations, strategies, financial results, or other developments and speak only as of the date made. These forward-looking statements, including statements about our 2022 – 2024 outlook for after-tax adjusted operating income and the anticipated impacts of Accounting Standard Update 2018-12, “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts”, are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. The following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements: (1) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and overall business operations; (2) sustained periods of low interest rates; (3) fluctuation in insurance reserve liabilities and claim payments due to changes in claim incidence, recovery rates, mortality and morbidity rates, and policy benefit offsets due to, among other factors, the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence, the emergence of new diseases, epidemics, or pandemics, new trends and developments in medical treatments, the effectiveness of our claims operational processes, and changes in governmental programs; (4) unfavorable economic or business conditions, both domestic and foreign, that may result in decreases in sales, premiums, or persistency, as well as unfavorable claims activity; (5) changes in, or interpretations or enforcement of laws and regulations; (6) a cyber attack or other security breach could result in the unauthorized acquisition of confidential data; (7) the failure of our business recovery and incident management processes to resume our business operations in the event of a natural catastrophe, cyber attack, or other event; (8) investment results, including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, defaults, changes in credit spreads, impairments, and the lack of appropriate investments in the market which can be acquired to match our liabilities; (9) increased competition from other insurers and financial services companies due to industry consolidation, new entrants to our markets, or other factors; (10) changes in our financial strength and credit ratings; (11) our ability to develop digital capabilities or execute on our technology systems upgrades or replacements; (12) actual experience in the broad array of our products that deviates from our assumptions used in pricing, underwriting, and reserving; (13) availability of reinsurance in the market and the ability of our reinsurers to meet their obligations to us; (14) ability to generate sufficient internal liquidity and/or obtain external financing; (15) damage to our reputation due to, among other factors, regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, external events, and/or inadequate or failed internal controls and procedures; (16) recoverability and/or realization of the carrying value of our intangible assets, long-lived assets, and deferred tax assets; (17) effectiveness of our risk management program; (18) contingencies and the level and results of litigation; (19) ineffectiveness of our derivatives hedging programs due to changes in the economic environment, counterparty risk, ratings downgrades, capital market volatility, changes in interest rates, and/or regulation; (20) fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. For further discussion of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are being made as of the date of this presentation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, even if made available on our website or otherwise.  

3 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe the following non-GAAP financial measure is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business: • After-tax adjusted operating income or loss, which differs from net income due to the exclusion of investment gains or losses and the amortization of the cost of reinsurance as well as certain other items, as applicable. Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives. Investment gains or losses and unrealized gains or losses on securities depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our Company. We also exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or loss as a measure of our overall profitability. Refer to the Appendix for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure used in this presentation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. LONG-DURATION TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS (LDTI) In 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update 2018-12, “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long- Duration Contracts”. This update significantly amends the accounting and disclosure requirements for long-duration insurance contracts. We will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2023 with changes applied as of January 1, 2021, also referred to as the transition date. The following outlook discussion does not include consideration of the impacts of this new accounting standard to projected future operating earnings, and therefore actual results may differ materially from the projections in this presentation after implementation of the accounting standard.

Our portfolio has performed well through challenging times, and we are taking steps now to meet the needs of the future INVESTMENTS ACTIONS 20 POSITIONING FOR THE FUTURE • Updated asset allocation focused on generating higher returns for our long tail liabilities ⁃ Added high-quality long duration municipal bonds ⁃ Reduced high yield exposure ⁃ Increased alternatives investment limit to 4%, from 2% OPPORTUNISTIC VIEW • Sourcing deals with 3rd party partners • Ready to take advantage of market dislocation, as we did in 2020 2021-2024 EPS1 Growth Contributions Investments Actions 1. After-tax adjusted operating earnings per share  

• During 4Q-2021 we restarted our share repurchase program at approximately $50M per quarter and paired it with an equal amount of accelerated recognition of the LTC PDR • We expect to maintain $200M of buybacks per year over our outlook horizon, along with expected Fairwind LTC contributions between $550-650M; once the recognition of the PDR is completed, the funding support for Fairwind is expected to decline to approximately ~$100M per year, providing a significant increase in free cash flow • We anticipate statutory operating income to recover to pre-pandemic levels over the next three years • Even with our expected shareholder return plans and accelerated PDR recognition, we still expect very healthy levels of capital at year-end 2024, as measured by: ⁃ RBC >350% ⁃ Holding company cash > than 1x annual interest and dividends ⁃ Leverage2 <30% ⁃ Contingent capital structure in place CAPITAL ACTIONS 21 2021-2024 EPS1 Growth Contributions Capital Actions 1.

Special Topics 22 Steve Zabel CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER  

23 LTC PREMIUM DEFICIENCY RESERVE • In May of 2020, a resolution was reached with MBOI to recognize a PDR over seven years, to be fully funded by YE-2026; Initially established at $2.1B as of 12/31/2018 • Calculated PDR will change over time, based on several factors, including: ⁃ Assumed reinvestment rate (medium-term look back) ⁃ Policyholder inventories ⁃ Rate increase activity ⁃ Underlying growth in locked-in reserve basis • Declines in reinvestment rates in 2020 produced increase in ultimate PDR balance ($3.0B), $667M recognized to date • Assuming 2.25% 10-Year Treasury rate, the remaining PDR to be recognized would be $1.4B, which equates to $1.1B in after-tax capital contributions; ability to fund by 2024 10-Year Treasury Yield* (assume rates held constant) 2026 PDR Ultimate Balance 2.50% $1.8B 2.25% $2.1B 2.00% $2.5B 1.75% $2.8B *Assumes 50bp 10 to 20/30 Year Treasury spread  

• LDTI will be implemented 1/1/23 with 1Q-23 the first reported quarter under the standard; 2021 and 2022 will also be recast under LDTI and be included in our 2023 filings • Today’s discussion, and our subsequent 10-K filing, will focus on LDTI adoption impact • Additional LDTI related disclosures and earnings implications anticipated during 2022 • Largest impact driven by change to the single-A discount rate versus the investment returns driven by our current investment strategy; very long liability duration products most impacted due to reserve size and duration profile • We view this GAAP-only accounting standard as non-economic; no impact to statutory earnings, risk-based capital, cashflow or business strategy LDTI OVERVIEW 24  

25 TRANSITION IMPACTS All changes to retained earnings at transition are a result of any cohorts of reserves when the net premium ratio exceeds 100%; All other impacts at transition result in a change to AOCI. TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS Impact to AOCI Impact to Retained Earnings Remove shadow DAC (FAS115 market value adj) N/A Remove shadow adjustment on Reserves (FAS115 market value adj) N/A Cohort NPR >100%; recalculate at best estimate N/A Mark Reserves to the single-A at 1/1/2021 N/A • LDTI equity decrease at transition date (1/1/2021) of $6.5B to $7B, almost entirely through AOCI; total equity post-transition impact of $4B to $4.5B ⁃ Liability cash flows are re-valued at current single-A rates, with impacts reflected in AOCI ⁃ Minimal impact to retained earnings as a result of shift to cohort-based reserving, an indication of the strong underlying balance sheet ⁃ LDTI does not immediately release underlying liability margin, therefore the balance sheet inclusive of AOCI at transition is not reflective of the true economics of the business • Majority of impact attributable to our very long liability duration products with additional impacts across other segments ⁃ Group & International business impacts minimal; LDTI liability mark generally consistent with current GAAP measurement ⁃ Impact from Voluntary Benefits; currently, substantial liability margins offset market adjustment while under LDTI, liability margin is independent of discount rate • Assuming year-end 2021 rates were in place at the end of 2020, the transition adjustment would have been a decrease to AOCI and total stockholders' equity of approximately $5.8B to $6.3B  

26 CREDIT IMPACT OF LDTI ~40% ~25% ~35% Components of impact at transition Current GAAP, before FAS115 INVESTMENT STRATEGY • Composition of our investment strategy differs from a broad single-A bond index, allowing us to outperform single-A • These higher yielding asset rates are now divorced from liability valuation under LDTI LONG-TERM VIEWS • Our long-term best estimate view of rates, including regression to a long-term mean for treasuries and spreads, is different than the current market forward curve Decomposing Components of Impact (LTC example) FAS 115 Adjustment Current GAAP Current Portfolio Assets to be purchased Long-term interest rate view LDTI
