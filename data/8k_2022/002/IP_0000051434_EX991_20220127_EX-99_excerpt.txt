Additionally, we returned $1.6 billion to shareowners through strong cash generation and reduced debt by $2.5 billion.”

Sutton added, “As we enter 2022, underlying customer demand remains solid, although we anticipate near-term pressure on volume due to Omicron-related labor and logistics constraints on the value chain. We expect to grow earnings in 2022 and are confident in our ability to accelerate value creation for our shareowners and customers as we take actions to Build a Better IP.”

* Adjusted operating earnings (non-GAAP) is defined as net earnings attributable to International Paper Company (GAAP) excluding discontinued operations, net special items and non-operating pension expense (income). Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results. For discussion of discontinued operations, net special items and non-operating pension expense (income), see the disclosure under Effects of Net Special Items, Discontinued Operations and Consolidated Statement of Operations and related notes included later in this release.

Select Financial Measures[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper's management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses and is calculated as set forth in footnote (h) below under "Sales and Earnings by Business Segment". As a result of the spin-off of our global Printing Papers business on October 1, 2021, the Printing Papers business segment has been eliminated and all current and prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect this business as a discontinued operation. For discussion of discontinued operations, see the disclosure under Discontinued Operations included later in this release. Fourth quarter 2021 net sales by business segment and operating profit (loss) by business segment compared with the third quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020 along with full year 2021 net sales by business segment and operating profit (loss) by business segment compared with full year 2020 are as follows:

Business Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Industrial Packaging operating profits (losses) in the fourth quarter of 2021 were $414 million compared with $414 million in the third quarter of 2021. In North America, earnings increased reflecting higher sales prices for corrugated boxes and containerboard. Sales volumes were stable for corrugated boxes and increased for containerboard. These benefits were partially offset by increased distribution, wood fiber, recovered fiber and energy costs. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 benefited from insurance recoveries. In Europe, earnings slightly improved reflecting seasonally higher volumes primarily in Morocco, mostly offset by higher energy costs. Average sales margins improved driven by an improved product mix.

Global Cellulose Fibers operating profits (losses) in the fourth quarter of 2021 were $1 million compared with $76 million in the third quarter of 2021. Earnings decreased primarily driven by higher planned maintenance outage expenses and input costs for energy and chemicals.Average sales prices were stable for fluff pulp and lower for market pulp. Sales volumes were slightly lower. Operating costs were higher driven by the non-repeat of favorable items in the third quarter of 2021. Distribution costs increased, reflecting the continued challenging export supply chain environment.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

Ilim joint venture equity earnings (loss) were $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $95 million in the third quarter of 2021. Operationally, earnings decreased reflecting lower export sales prices for softwood pulp and hardwood pulp and domestic sales prices for containerboard. Lower maintenance outage expenses were more than offset by higher other costs.

CORPORATE EXPENSES

Corporate expenses were $49 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $13 million in the third quarter of 2021. 

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

The reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was (11)%, compared to a 2021 third quarter reported effective tax rate of 15%. The reported effective tax rate in the fourth quarter reflects tax benefits recognized after the finalization of the 2020 state and local income tax returns. The effective tax in the fourth quarter also includes the tax benefit associated with the $238 million of debt extinguishment costs. The tax rate in the third quarter of 2021 reflects tax benefits recognized after the finalization of the 2020 U.S. Federal income tax return. 

Excluding special items and non-operating pension expense, the operational effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 20%, compared with 15% for the third quarter of 2021.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY

Reconciliation of Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to International Paper Company to Adjusted Operating Earnings

Preliminary and Unaudited

(In millions, except per share amounts)

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

The Company calculates Adjusted Operating Earnings (non-GAAP) by excluding the after-tax effect of discontinued operations, non-operating pension expense (income) and items considered by management to be unusual (net special items) as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and related notes included in this release from the earnings reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results. The Company believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations by quarter. Net earnings (loss) attributable to International Paper is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Since diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each period, twelve-month per share amounts may not equal the sum of respective quarters.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY

Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operations to Free Cash Flow

Preliminary and Unaudited

(In millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is cash provided by operations. Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, service debt and make investments for future growth. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. By adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing performance, free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods. 

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company’s presentation of non-GAAP measures in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in the same industry as International Paper.

Management believes non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with information presented in accordance with GAAP, can facilitate a better understanding of the impact of various factors and trends on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.
