There were no disagreements between Mr. Anderson and the Company in connection with his retirement.  

In addition, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company annually considers the members of senior management who should be designated as “officers” of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Mr. Fawcett will continue in his role as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.
