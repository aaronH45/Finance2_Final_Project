"2021 was a transformational year for Verizon that will serve as a catalyst for us," said Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg. "We delivered on all of our goals in 2021 and made great progress on our five paths of growth, finishing the year with strong operating and financial momentum. As we move into 2022, we have the necessary assets to realize our strategy that we laid out in 2019. We are laser focused on executing our 5G strategy and providing value to our customers, shareholders, employees, and society, as 2022 will be the most exciting year yet for Verizon."

“Verizon delivered another strong earnings performance this quarter,” said Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis.

Outlook and guidance

For 2022, Verizon expects the following:

•Organic service and other revenue growth of around 3 percent. On a reported basis, which includes the net impact of the sale of Verizon Media and the company's ownership of TracFone, service and other revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 1.0 percent and 1.5 percent.

•Reported wireless service revenue growth in the range of 9 percent to 10 percent. Excluding the impact of the TracFone acquisition, wireless service revenue is expected to grow at least 3 percent. 

•Adjusted EBITDA* growth in the range of 2 percent to 3 percent.

•Adjusted EPS* of $5.40 to $5.55. The company expects adjusted EBITDA* growth in 2022 to be offset by headwinds from non-cash items. Beginning in 2022, the company's adjusted EPS* will exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In 2021, the intangible amortization negatively impacted adjusted EPS* by approximately 11 cents. In 2022, the company anticipates the impact to be approximately 17 cents to 19 cents.

•Adjusted effective income tax rate* in the range of 23 percent to 25 percent.

•Capital spending, excluding C-Band, in the range of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion, a decrease from $18.2 billion in 2021, as the company has started its progress towards lower capital intensity. Additional expenditures related to the deployment of the company's C-Band 5G network are expected to be in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion as the company continues to build out the initial markets and begins preparations for deploying Phase 2 spectrum.
