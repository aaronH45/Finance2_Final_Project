 Item 5.02. 

Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers 

On January 12, 2022, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Xerox Holdings Corporation (the “Company”), in order to incentivize retention and the execution of the Company’s strategic goals, which include the standing up of new businesses, approved the material terms of an arrangement under which certain employees, including named executive officers other than the Company’s Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will be eligible to receive a bonus in the event a future transaction occurs that constitutes a “liquidity event” with respect to a designated business unit (as determined in accordance with the Grant Instrument, defined below). 

The amount of each transaction bonus will be a specified percentage, not to exceed 1%, of the increase, if any, in the fair market value of the designated business unit between (i) the time the Grant Instrument was awarded, and (ii) the time of the liquidity event with respect to the designated business unit, with the result adjusted for relevant changes in capital structure. Entitlement to payment will be subject to additional conditions relating to continued employment and 

non-engagement in certain activity. Payment will generally be in a lump sum, with the form of payout, whether cash or securities, to be determined in advance of payment. The arrangement will expire if a liquidity event has not occurred with respect to the designated business unit by the tenth anniversary of the grant. 

The foregoing description of the material terms of this arrangement, the full terms of which will be set forth in a form Transaction Bonus Grant Instrument (the “Grant Instrument”), does not purport to be a complete description of the terms of the arrangement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of the Transaction Bonus Grant Instrument, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company’s next Quarterly Report on Form 

10-Q or Annual Report on Form 

10-K.
