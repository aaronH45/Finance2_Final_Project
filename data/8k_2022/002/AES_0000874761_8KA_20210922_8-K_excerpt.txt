EXPLANATORY NOTE

The AES Corporation (the “Company” or “AES”) is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A (the “Amendment”) to amend its Form 8-K, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 22, 2021 (the “Original 8-K”). The Original 8-K reported, among other things, the appointment of Stephen Coughlin to serve as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective October 15, 2021. There were no material changes initially made to Mr. Coughlin’s compensatory arrangements, or awards granted, in connection with his appointment as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

This Amendment is being filed for the sole purpose of supplementing Item 5.02 of the Original 8-K to include additional disclosure regarding subsequent changes to Mr. Coughlin’s compensatory arrangements in connection with his promotion. No other revisions have been made to the Original 8-K, and other than as mentioned in the foregoing sentence, this Amendment does not amend, update, or change any other items or disclosures contained in the Original 8-K.

Item 5.02

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

In connection with Mr. Coughlin’s promotion to serve as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, on February 24, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved the following awards and adjustments to Mr. Coughlin’s compensation arrangements, effective on such date:

•Annual base salary of $580,000;

•Annual performance cash incentive plan target award opportunity of 100% of his annual base salary, which award will be paid, if earned, subject to the attainment of pre-established performance goals; and

•Annual long-term compensation target opportunity of 225% of his annual base salary, which, for 2022, includes the award of (i) performance stock units and performance cash units, which will each be paid, if earned, subject to the attainment of pre-established performance goals over a three-year performance period, and (ii) restricted stock units, which will generally vest in three installments on each annual anniversary of the grant date.

On February 24, 2022, the Board added Mr. Coughlin as a participant in The AES Corporation Amended and Restated Executive Severance Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan provides for the payment of severance payments and benefits if an executive in his or a similar executive position (i) is terminated involuntarily outside of a change in control (as defined in the Plan) or (ii) is terminated involuntarily or terminates employment for good reason (as defined in the Plan) within two years after a change in control, including: (a) a pro-rata annual bonus; (b) one times base salary and target bonus (two times in the event of a change in control-related termination), subject to the execution (and non-revocation) of a release of claims against the Company; (c) 12-months of health and welfare benefits (18 months in the event of a change in control-related termination); and (d) outplacement assistance, subject to compliance with the confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation, and other covenants set forth in the Plan. 

Mr. Coughlin is also eligible for benefits similar to those of existing AES executives, including, without limitation, participation in the Company’s health, welfare, retirement, and relocation plans and programs.
