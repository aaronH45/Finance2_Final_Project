CEO Perspective 

Sean Connolly, president and chief executive officer of Conagra Brands, commented, “Our business delivered another quarter of strong net sales growth as we continued to experience elevated levels of demand across our portfolio. I am proud of our team for continuing to demonstrate great agility in navigating the dynamic external landscape with a refuse to lose attitude and dedication to executing our Conagra Way playbook every day. Our focus on strategic innovation and our intentional approach to investment helped us maintain brand momentum in the second quarter and continue capturing share across each of our domains – frozen, snacks, and staples.”

He continued, “Looking ahead, we expect to continue experiencing cost pressures above original expectations in the second half of fiscal 2022. However, we believe the sustained elevated consumer demand coupled with the mitigating actions we have successfully executed, and will continue executing, put us on track to overcome these near-term challenges, improve margins in the back half of the fiscal year, and deliver on our profit plan.” 

Total Company Second Quarter Results 

In the quarter, net sales increased 2.1% to $3.1 billion. The increase in net sales primarily reflects: 

•  

a 0.7% net decrease from the divestitures of the H.K. Anderson business, the Peter Pan peanut butter business, and the Egg Beaters business (collectively, the Sold Businesses); 

•  

a 0.2% increase from the favorable impact of foreign exchange; and 

•  

a 2.6% increase in organic net sales.  

The 2.6% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 6.8% improvement in price/mix, which was partially offset by a 4.2% decrease in volume. Price/mix was driven by favorable brand mix and net pricing as the company’s inflation-driven pricing actions were reflected in the marketplace throughout the quarter. The volume decrease was primarily a result of lapping the prior year’s surge in at-home food demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The year-over-year comparison negatively impacted fiscal 2022 second quarter volume growth rates in the company’s retail reporting segments.  

Gross profit decreased 15.1% to $755 million in the quarter, and adjusted gross profit decreased 14.4% to $767 million. Second quarter gross profit benefited from higher organic net sales, supply chain realized productivity, lower COVID-19 pandemic-related expenses, and cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition. These benefits, however, were not enough to offset the impacts of cost of goods sold inflation of 16.4% and the lost profit from the Sold Businesses. Gross margin decreased 500 basis points to 24.7% in the quarter, and adjusted gross margin decreased 483 basis points to 25.1%. Adjusted gross margin declined more than originally expected as the company experienced higher-than-expected cost of goods sold inflation, made additional investments to prioritize servicing orders to maximize food supply for consumers, and experienced additional transitory supply chain costs.  

Selling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A), which includes advertising and promotional expense (A&P), decreased 3.5% to $345 million in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A, which excludes A&P, was relatively flat compared to the prior-year period, increasing 1.7% to $248 million.  

A&P for the quarter increased 12.5% to $71 million, driven primarily by higher eCommerce investments.  

Net interest expense was $95 million in the quarter. Compared to the prior-year period, net interest expense decreased 11.8% or $13 million, primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt.  

The average diluted share count decreased 1.8% compared to the prior-year period to 482 million, driven by the company’s share repurchase activity in prior quarters.  

In the quarter, net income attributable to Conagra Brands decreased 27.3% to $275 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Conagra Brands decreased 22.8% to $306 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the quarter. The decreases were driven primarily by the decrease in gross profit. The combination of higher than expected inflation, investments to service orders, and additional transitory costs is estimated to have impacted adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04 to $0.06 in the quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA, which includes equity method investment earnings and pension and postretirement non-service income, decreased 17.9% to $585 million in the quarter, primarily driven by the decrease in adjusted gross profit.  

Grocery & Snacks Segment Second Quarter Results 

Net sales for the Grocery & Snacks segment decreased 1.4% to $1.3 billion in the quarter reflecting: 

•  

a 0.8% decrease from the impact of the Sold Businesses; and 

•  

a 0.6% decrease in organic net sales. 

On an organic net sales basis, volume decreased 5.3% and price/mix increased 4.7%. The volume decline was primarily due to lapping the prior year’s surge in at-home food demand from the COVID-19 pandemic. Price/mix was primarily driven by favorability in inflation-driven pricing coupled with favorable brand mix. In the quarter, the company gained share in staples categories such as beans, and in snacking categories, including popcorn and seeds. 

Operating profit for the segment decreased 21.2% to $249 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit decreased 14.1% to $274 million, primarily driven by cost of goods inflation, the organic net sales decline, incremental transitory supply chain costs, and the lost profit from the Sold Businesses. These negative impacts were partially offset by supply chain realized productivity, cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition, and lower COVID-19 pandemic-related expenses. 

Refrigerated & Frozen Segment Second Quarter Results 

Net sales for the Refrigerated & Frozen segment increased 3.0% to $1.3 billion in the quarter reflecting: 

•  

a 0.9% decrease from the impact of the Sold Businesses; and 

•  

a 3.9% increase in organic net sales. 

On an organic net sales basis, volume decreased 4.7% and price/mix increased 8.6%. The volume decline was primarily due to lapping the prior year’s surge in at-home food demand from the COVID-19 pandemic. The price/mix increase was driven by favorable brand mix and favorability in inflation-driven pricing. In the quarter, the company gained share in categories such as frozen single serve meals, whipped topping, and frozen desserts.  

Operating profit for the segment decreased 36.3% to $168 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit decreased 30.4% to $189 million primarily due to cost of goods sold inflation, additional investments the company made to service orders, increased A&P investment, and the lost profit from the Sold Businesses. These impacts were partially offset by the benefits of supply chain realized productivity, higher organic net sales, lower COVID-19 pandemic-related expenses, and cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition. 

International Segment Second Quarter Results 

Net sales for the International segment increased 5.0% to $262 million in the quarter reflecting: 

•  

a 0.1% decrease from the impact of the Sold Businesses, 

•  

a 3.0% increase from the favorable impact of foreign exchange; and 

•  

a 2.1% increase in organic net sales. 

On an organic net sales basis, volume decreased 5.8% and price/mix increased 7.9%. Volume decreased primarily due to lapping the prior year’s surge in demand from the COVID-19 pandemic. The price/mix increase was driven by inflation-driven pricing and favorable product mix.  

CONAGRA BRANDS 

page 4 

Operating profit for the segment decreased 5.8% to $37 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit decreased 5.9% to $37 million as the negative impacts of cost of goods sold inflation and increased A&P investment more than offset the benefits from favorable foreign exchange, supply chain realized productivity, and higher organic net sales. 

Foodservice Segment Second Quarter Results 

Net sales for the Foodservice segment increased 14.9% to $246 million in the quarter reflecting: 

•  

a 0.3% decrease from the impact of the Sold Businesses; and 

•  

a 15.2% increase in organic net sales. 

On an organic net sales basis, volume increased 9.1% as restaurant traffic continued to improve from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Price/mix was favorable at 6.1% in the quarter driven by inflation-driven pricing and favorable product mix. 

Operating profit for the segment decreased 39.1% to $14 million and adjusted operating profit decreased 18.1% to $19 million in the quarter as the impacts of cost of goods sold inflation more than offset the benefits of higher organic net sales and favorable supply chain realized productivity.  

Other Second Quarter Items 

Corporate expenses decreased 47.0% to $59 million in the quarter primarily from lapping incremental expenses related to the extinguishment of debt in the prior year period. Adjusted corporate expense increased 10.1% to $71 million in the quarter driven by increased employee related costs.  

Pension and post-retirement non-service income was $16 million in the quarter compared to $14 million of income in the prior-year period. 

In the quarter, equity method investment earnings were $30 million. The $7 million increase was primarily driven by favorable market conditions for the Ardent Mills joint venture.  

In the quarter, the effective tax rate was 23.4% compared to 17.6% in the prior-year period. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 23.2% in the prior-year period. 

In the quarter, the company paid a dividend of $0.3125 per share, the first dividend payment at the increased rate.  

Outlook 

The company is reiterating its adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2022 and updating its organic net sales and adjusted operating margin guidance. The outlook reflects expectations for continued top line strength, and higher cost of goods sold inflation, and the timing effect of additional pricing actions.  

The company previously shared its expectations that consumer demand for its retail products would remain elevated versus historical levels throughout fiscal 2022, as consumers have developed new habits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the trends to date, including stronger-than-expected consumer demand and lower-than-anticipated elasticities of demand, as well as additional planned pricing actions, organic net sales growth is now expected to be higher than previously anticipated. 

The company also continues to experience elevated cost of goods sold inflation, the rate of which was higher than expected during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The company has taken, and plans to continue taking, a variety of actions to counteract the impact of this inflation, including incremental pricing actions and cost

savings measures. The company continues to expect that the timing of the associated benefits from these margin lever actions will increase as the fiscal year progresses and, as a result, the company continues to expect margins to improve in the second half of the fiscal year. 

The Company's updated fiscal 2022 guidance is as follows: 

•  

Organic net sales growth is expected to be approximately +3% versus prior guidance of approximately +1% 

•  

Gross inflation (input cost inflation before the impacts of hedging and other sourcing benefits) is expected to be approximately 14% versus prior guidance of approximately 11% 

•  

Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 15.5% versus prior guidance of approximately 16% 

•  

Adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $2.50, representing no change to prior guidance. 

The above guidance is the company’s best estimate of its expected financial performance in fiscal 2022. The company’s ultimate fiscal 2022 performance will be highly dependent on factors including, without limitation: 

•  

how consumers purchase food as foodservice establishments continue to reopen and people return to in-office work and in-person school;  

•  

the cost of goods sold inflation the company experiences;  

•  

consumers’ response to inflation-driven price increases; and  

•  

the ability of the end-to-end supply chain to continue to operate effectively as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. 

The inability to predict the amount and timing of the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures, and other items impacting comparability makes a detailed reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures impracticable. Please see the end of this release for more information.

Definitions 

Organic net sales excludes, from reported net sales, the impacts of foreign exchange, divested businesses and acquisitions, as well as the impact of any 53rd week. All references to changes in volume and price/mix throughout this release are on an organic net sales basis. 

References to adjusted items throughout this release refer to measures computed in accordance with GAAP less the impact of items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are income or expenses (and related tax impacts) that management believes have had, or are likely to have, a significant impact on the earnings of the applicable business segment or on the total corporation for the period in which the item is recognized, and are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. These items thus affect the comparability of underlying results from period to period.  

References to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) refer to net income attributable to Conagra Brands before the impacts of discontinued operations, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, depreciation, and amortization. References to adjusted EBITDA refer to EBITDA before the impacts of items impacting comparability. 

References to two-year compounded annualized numbers are calculated as: ([(1 + current year period’s growth rate) * (1 + prior year period’s growth rate)] ^ 0.5) – 1. 

Please note that certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS, organic net sales, adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating profit, adjusted SG&A, adjusted corporate expenses, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income attributable to Conagra Brands, two-year compounded annualized organic net sales, two-year compounded annualized adjusted EPS, free cash flow, net debt, net leverage ratio, and adjusted EBITDA. Management considers GAAP financial measures as well as such non-GAAP financial information in its evaluation of the Company’s financial statements and believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information to assess the Company’s operating performance and financial position. These measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company’s diluted earnings per share, operating performance and financial measures as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

CONAGRA BRANDS 

page 8 

Certain of these non-GAAP measures, such as organic net sales, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted EPS, are forward-looking. Historically, the Company has excluded the impact of certain items impacting comparability, such as, but not limited to, restructuring expenses, the impact of the extinguishment of debt, the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, hedging gains and losses, impairment charges, the impact of legacy legal contingencies, and the impact of unusual tax items, from the non-GAAP financial measures it presents. Reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are not provided because the Company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort, due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and the financial impact of such items impacting comparability and the periods in which such items may be recognized. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results. 

Hedge gains and losses are generally aggregated, and net amounts are reclassified from unallocated corporate expense to the operating segments when the underlying commodity or foreign currency being hedged is expensed in segment cost of goods sold. The Company identifies these amounts as items that impact comparability within the discussion of unallocated Corporate results.
