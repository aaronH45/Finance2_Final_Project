(NYSE: CNP) or “CenterPoint” today reported income available to common shareholders of $641 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, income available to common shareholders and earnings per diluted share were $1,391 million and $2.28, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, Utility EPS for the fourth quarter 2021 and the full year 2021 was $0.27 and $1.27 per diluted share, respectively. On a consolidated non-GAAP basis, EPS for the fourth quarter 2021 and the full year 2021 was $0.36 and $1.64 per diluted share, respectively. Beginning in 2022, the company will no longer separate utility and midstream operations and will report on a consolidated non-GAAP EPS basis. “2021 was a great year for CenterPoint with quarter after quarter of meeting or exceeding expectations,” said Dave Lesar, President and Chief Executive Officer of CenterPoint. “In summary, we have had seven quarters of execution, achieved 8.5% Utility EPS growth for 2021, executed two large strategic transactions, increased our 5- year capital plan to $19.2 billion and are continuing to find ways to increase our capital plan over the course of our 10-year plan to benefit our customers and our investors. This includes the potential of what may come from the recently announced resiliency initiative for the greater Houston area.” Lesar added, “I firmly believe we are becoming a premium utility by consistently extending our track record of delivering on our strategy. Looking ahead, we intend to invest $40+ billion in capital during our 10-year plan dedicated to growth, safety and resiliency, and clean enablement. This supports our plan to grow our non-GAAP EPS at 8% per year through 2024, and the mid-to-high end of our 6-8% annual range thereafter through 2030.” For more information contact Media: Communications Media.Relations@CenterPointEnergy.com Investors: Jackie Richert Phone 713.207.6500  

 2 Earnings Outlook Given the merger between Enable and Energy Transfer and its anticipated divestiture of its remaining midstream investments during 2022, CenterPoint Energy will be presenting a consolidated non-GAAP EPS guidance range for 2022. In addition to presenting its financial results in accordance with GAAP, including presentation of income (loss) available to common shareholders and diluted earnings (loss) per share, CenterPoint Energy provides guidance based on non-GAAP income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management evaluates CenterPoint Energy’s financial performance in part based on non-GAAP income and non- GAAP earnings per share. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of CenterPoint Energy’s overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods. The adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that Management believes do not most accurately reflect the company’s fundamental business performance. These excluded items are reflected in the reconciliation tables of this news release, where applicable. CenterPoint Energy’s non-GAAP income and non- GAAP diluted earnings per share measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share, which respectively are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures also may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 2021 non-GAAP Utility EPS guidance range “Utility EPS” includes net income from the company’s Electric and Natural Gas segments, as well as after tax Corporate and Other operating income and an allocation of corporate overhead based upon Electric’s and Natural Gas’s relative earnings contribution. Corporate overhead consists primarily of interest expense, preferred stock dividend requirements, and other items directly attributable to the parent along with the associated income taxes. • 2021 Utility EPS excludes: ◦ Earnings or losses from the change in value of ZENS and related securities ◦ Earnings and losses associated with the ownership and disposal of midstream common and preferred units (including amounts reported in discontinued operations), net gain associated with the consummation of the merger between Enable and Energy Transfer, a corresponding amount of debt related to midstream common and preferred units, and an allocation of associated corporate overhead ◦ Cost associated with the early extinguishment of debt ◦ Impacts associated with Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDC sales ◦ Certain impacts associated with other mergers and divestitures  

 3 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance range Beginning in 2022, CenterPoint Energy will no longer separate utility and midstream operations and will report on a consolidated non-GAAP EPS basis. • 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes: ◦ Earnings or losses from the change in value of ZENS and related securities ◦ Gain and impact, including related expenses, associated with Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDC sales ◦ Income and expense related to ownership and disposal of Energy Transfer common and Series G preferred units, and a corresponding amount of debt related to the units In providing this guidance, CenterPoint Energy does not consider the items noted above and other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, impairments or other unusual items, which could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the applicable guidance period. The 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance range also considers assumptions for certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as customer growth and usage including normal weather, throughput, recovery of capital invested, effective tax rates, financing activities and related interest rates, and regulatory and judicial proceedings. To the extent actual results deviate from these assumptions, the 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance range may not be met or the projected annual non-GAAP EPS growth rate may change. CenterPoint Energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of Energy Transfer, ZENS and related securities, future impairments, and other unusual items are not estimable and are difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management’s control.
