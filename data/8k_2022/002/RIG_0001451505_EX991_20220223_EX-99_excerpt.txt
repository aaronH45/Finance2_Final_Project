To the General Meeting of Zurich, February 23, 2022

Transocean Ltd., Steinhausen 

Report of the statutory auditor on the consolidated financial statements

Opinion

As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Transocean Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the Company), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, equity, cash flows, and notes to the consolidated financial statements for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and comply with Swiss law.

Board of Directors’ responsibility

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm and are required to be independent with respect to the Company. We conducted our audits in accordance with Swiss law, Swiss Auditing Standards and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Critical audit matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Auditing management’s provision for income taxes and related deferred taxes was complex because of the Company’s multi-national operating structure. In addition, a higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s deferred tax provision as a result of the Company’s interpretation of tax law in each jurisdiction across its multiple subsidiaries.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit​

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s income tax provision process, including controls over management’s review of the identification and valuation of deferred income taxes and changes in tax laws and regulations that may impact the Company’s deferred income tax provision.

Our audit procedures also included, among others, (i) obtaining an understanding of the Company’s overall tax structure, evaluating changes in the Company’s tax structure that occurred during the year as well as changes in tax law, and assessing the interpretation of those changes under the relevant jurisdiction’s tax law; (ii) utilizing tax resources with appropriate knowledge of local jurisdictional laws and regulations; (iii) evaluating the completeness and accuracy of deferred income taxes, and (iv) assessing the reasonableness of the Company’s valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, including projections of taxable income from the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences.

​​Equity-Method Investment in Orion Holdings (Cayman) Limited

Description of the Matter​

As discussed in Notes 2 and 4, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $37 million associated with its equity-method investment in Orion Holdings (Cayman) Limited (Orion) upon determination that the carrying amount of its investment exceeded the estimated fair value and that the impairment was other than temporary. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate carrying amount of the Company’s equity-method investment in Orion was $57 million.

Auditing management’s equity-method investment valuation was complex and judgmental due to the estimation required in determining the fair value of the investment. In particular, the fair value estimate of the equity-method investment in Orion was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the discount rate, future demand and supply of harsh environment floaters, rig utilization, revenue efficiency and dayrates.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit​

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process to determine the fair value of the investment in Orion, including controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above as well as over the underlying data used in the fair value determination.

To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s equity-method investment in Orion, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the valuation methodologies utilized by management and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We involved a valuation specialist to assist in our evaluation of the Company's model, valuation methodology and significant assumptions. We reviewed for contrary evidence related to the determination of the fair value of the equity-method investment, including reviewing relevant market data and internal Company forecasts.

​

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Swiss Federal Audit Oversight Authority (FAOA) and the PCAOB and we confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA). We are independent with respect to the Company in accordance with Swiss law (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and U.S. federal securities laws as well as the applicable rules and regulations of the Swiss audit profession, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.

We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1—Business

Transocean Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, “Transocean,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells. As of December 31, 2021, we owned or had partial ownership interests in and operated a fleet of 37 mobile offshore drilling units, consisting of 27 ultra-deepwater floaters and 10 harsh environment floaters. As of December 31, 2021, we were constructing two ultra-deepwater drillships.

We provide, as our primary business, contract drilling services in a single operating segment, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews to drill oil and gas wells. We specialize in technically demanding regions of the global offshore drilling business with a particular focus on ultra-deepwater and harsh environment drilling services. Our drilling fleet is one of the most versatile fleets in the world, consisting of drillships and semisubmersible floaters used in support of offshore drilling activities and offshore support services on a worldwide basis.

We perform contract drilling services by deploying our high-specification fleet in a single, global market that is geographically dispersed in oil and gas exploration and development areas throughout the world. The location of our rigs and the allocation of our resources to build or upgrade rigs are determined by the activities and needs of our customers.

Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting estimates—To prepare financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.”), we must make judgments by applying estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to our income taxes, property and equipment, equity investments, contingencies, allowance for excess materials and supplies, intangibles, allowance for credit losses, leases, postemployment benefit plans and share-based compensation. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from such estimates.

Fair value measurements—We estimate fair value at an exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Our valuation techniques require inputs that we categorize using a three-level hierarchy, from highest to lowest level of observable inputs, as follows: (1) significant observable inputs, including unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (“Level 1”), (2) significant other observable inputs, including direct or indirect market data for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in less active markets (“Level 2”) and (3) significant unobservable inputs, including those that require considerable judgment for which there is little or no market data (“Level 3”). When a valuation requires multiple input levels, we categorize the entire fair value measurement according to the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement even though we may have also utilized significant inputs that are more readily observable.

Consolidation—We consolidate entities in which we have a majority voting interest and entities that meet the criteria for variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary for accounting purposes. We eliminate intercompany transactions and accounts in consolidation. We apply the equity method of accounting for an equity investment in an unconsolidated entity if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity that (a) does not meet the variable interest entity criteria or (b) meets the variable interest entity criteria, but for which we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. We measure other equity investments at fair value if the investment has a fair value that is readily determinable; otherwise, we measure the investment at cost, less any impairment. We separately present within equity on our consolidated balance sheets the ownership interests attributable to parties with noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries, and we separately present net income attributable to such parties on our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 4—Unconsolidated Affiliates and Note 14—Equity.

Revenues and related pre-operating costs—We recognize revenues earned under our drilling contracts based on variable dayrates, which range from a full operating dayrate to lower rates or zero rates for periods when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted, based on the specific activities we perform during the contract on an hourly, or more frequent, basis. Such dayrate consideration is attributed to the distinct time period to which it relates within the contract term, and therefore, is recognized as we perform the services. When the operating dayrate declines over the contract term, we recognize revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated contract period. We recognize reimbursement revenues and the corresponding costs as we provide the customer-requested goods and services, when such reimbursable costs are incurred while performing drilling operations. Prior to performing drilling operations, we may receive pre-operating revenues, on either a fixed lump-sum or variable dayrate basis, for mobilization, contract preparation, customer-requested goods and services or capital upgrades, for which we record a contract liability and recognize as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated contract period. We recognize losses for loss contracts as such losses are incurred. We recognize revenues for demobilization over the contract period unless otherwise constrained. We recognize revenues from contract terminations as we fulfill our obligations and all contingencies have been resolved. We apply the optional exemption that permits us to exclude disclosure of the estimated transaction price related to the variable portion of unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the reporting period, as our transaction price is based

TRANSOCEAN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued

on a single performance obligation consisting of a series of distinct hourly, or more frequent, periods, the variability of which will be resolved at the time of the future services.

To obtain contracts with our customers, we incur pre-operating costs to prepare a rig for contract and mobilize a rig to the drilling location. We defer such pre-operating contract preparation and mobilization costs for recognition in operating and maintenance costs over the estimated contract period on a straight-line basis, consistent with the general pace of activity. See Note 5—Revenues.

Contract intangible assets—We recognize contract intangible assets related to acquired executory contracts, such as drilling contracts. The drilling contract intangible assets represent the amount by which the fixed dayrates of the acquired contracts were above the market dayrates that were available or expected to be available during the term of the contract for similar contracts, measured as of the acquisition date. We amortize the carrying amount of the drilling contract intangible assets using the straight-line method as a reduction of contract drilling revenues over the expected remaining contract period. See Note 6—Contract Intangible Assets.

Share-based compensation—To measure the fair values of granted or modified service-based restricted share units, we use the market price of our shares on the grant date or modification date. To measure the fair values of granted or modified stock options, we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model and apply assumptions for the expected life, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and dividend yield. To measure the fair values of granted or modified performance-based restricted share units subject to market factors, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model and, in addition to the assumptions applied for the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, we use a risk neutral approach and an average price at the performance start date. To measure the fair values of granted or modified performance-based restricted share units that are subject to performance targets, we use the market price of our shares on the grant date or modification date adjusted for the projected performance rate expected to be achieved at the end of the measurement period. We recognize share-based compensation expense in the same financial statement line item as cash compensation paid to the respective employees or non-employee directors. We recognize such compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period through the date the employee or non-employee director is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. See Note 15—Share-Based Compensation.

Capitalized interest—We capitalize interest costs for qualifying construction and upgrade projects and only capitalize interest costs during periods in which progress for the construction projects continues to be underway. In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized interest costs of $50 million, $47 million and $38 million, respectively, for our construction work in progress.

Functional currency—We consider the U.S. dollar to be the functional currency for all of our operations since the majority of our revenues and expenditures are denominated in U.S. dollars, which limits our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. We recognize currency exchange rate gains and losses in other, net. In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized a net loss of $1 million, a net loss of $8 million and a net gain of $2 million, respectively, related to currency exchange rates.

Income taxes—We provide for income taxes based on expected taxable income, statutory rates, tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the jurisdictions in which we operate or have a taxable presence. We recognize the effect of changes in tax laws as of the date of enactment. We recognize potential global intangible low-taxed income inclusions as a period cost.

We maintain liabilities for estimated tax exposures in our jurisdictions of operation, and we recognize the provisions and benefits resulting from changes to those liabilities in our income tax expense or benefit along with related interest and penalties. Income tax exposure items include potential challenges to permanent establishment positions, intercompany pricing, disposition transactions, and withholding tax rates and their applicability. These tax exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means, but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which could cause us to revise past estimates.

We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or paid. In evaluating our ability to realize deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income and the existence of cumulative losses in recent years. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. For example, we may record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses incurred during the year in certain jurisdictions for which the benefit of the losses will not be realized or for foreign tax credit carryforwards that may expire prior to their utilization. See Note 11—Income Taxes.

Cash and cash equivalents—We consider cash equivalents to include highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less, such as time deposits with commercial banks that have high credit ratings, U.S. Treasury and government securities, Eurodollar time deposits, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. We may also invest excess funds in no-load, open-ended, management investment trusts. Such management trusts invest exclusively in high-quality money market instruments.

Restricted cash and cash equivalents—We maintain restricted cash and cash equivalents that are either pledged for debt service under certain bond indentures, as required under certain bank credit arrangements, or held in accounts that are subject to restrictions due to legislation, regulation or court order. We classify such restricted cash and cash equivalents in current assets if the restriction is expected to expire or otherwise be resolved within one year or if such funds are considered to offset liabilities that are properly classified as current liabilities. See Note 9—Debt and Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies.

AR – 9
TRANSOCEAN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued

Materials and supplies—We record materials and supplies at their average cost less an allowance for excess items. We estimate the allowance for excess items based on historical experience and expectations for future use of the materials and supplies. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we identified certain materials and supplies that were in excess of our expected future usage based on our current market outlook. As a result of these items, we increased our allowance by $28 million ($0.04 per diluted share, net of tax). At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our allowance for excess items was $183 million and $143 million, respectively.

Assets held for sale—We classify an asset as held for sale when the facts and circumstances meet the criteria for such classification, including the following: (a) we have committed to a plan to sell the asset, (b) the asset is available for immediate sale, (c) we have initiated actions to complete the sale, including locating a buyer, (d) the sale is expected to be completed within one year, (e) the asset is being actively marketed at a price that is reasonable relative to its fair value, and (f) the plan to sell is unlikely to be subject to significant changes or termination. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no assets classified as held for sale.

Property and equipment—We apply judgment to account for our property and equipment, consisting primarily of offshore drilling rigs and related equipment, related to estimates and assumptions for cost capitalization, useful lives and salvage values. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate carrying amount of our property and equipment represented approximately 83 percent of our total assets.

We capitalize expenditures for newbuilds, renewals, replacements and improvements, including capitalized interest, if applicable, and we recognize the expense for maintenance and repair costs as incurred. For newbuild construction projects, we also capitalize the initial preparation, mobilization and commissioning costs incurred until the drilling unit is placed into service. Upon sale or other disposition of an asset, we recognize a net gain or loss on disposal of the asset, which is measured as the difference between the net carrying amount of the asset and the net proceeds received. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method after allowing for salvage values.

The estimated original useful life of our drilling units is 35 years, our buildings and improvements range from two to 30 years and our machinery and equipment range from four to 20 years. We reevaluate the remaining useful lives and salvage values of our rigs when certain events occur that directly impact the useful lives and salvage values of the rigs, including changes in operating condition, functional capability and market and economic factors. When evaluating the remaining useful lives of rigs, we also consider major capital upgrades required to perform certain contracts and the long-term impact of those upgrades on future marketability.

Long-lived asset impairment—We review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and right-of-use assets, for potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. For assets classified as held and used, we determine recoverability by evaluating the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows based on projected dayrates and utilization of the asset group under review. We consider our asset groups to be ultra-deepwater floaters and harsh environment floaters. When an impairment of one or more of our asset groups is indicated, we measure the impairment as the amount by which the asset group’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We measure the fair values of our asset groups by applying a variety of valuation methods, incorporating a combination of cost, income and market approaches, using projected discounted cash flows and estimates of the exchange price that would be received for the assets in the principal or most advantageous market for the assets in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. For an asset classified as held for sale, we consider the asset to be impaired to the extent its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value less cost to sell. See Note 7—Long-Lived Assets.

Equity investments and impairment—We review our equity-method investments, and other equity investments for which a readily determinable fair value is not available, for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable in the near term. If we determine that an impairment that is other than temporary exists, we recognize an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its estimated fair value. To estimate the fair value of the investment, we apply valuation methods that rely primarily on the income and market approaches. In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized a loss of $37 million and $62 million, respectively, associated with the other-than-temporary impairment of the carrying amount of our equity investments. See Note 4—Unconsolidated Affiliates.

Pension and other postemployment benefit plans—We use a measurement date of January 1 for determining net periodic benefit costs and December 31 for determining plan benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets. We determine our net periodic benefit costs based on a market-related value of assets that reduces year-to-year volatility by including investment gains or losses subject to amortization over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. We calculate investment gains or losses for this purpose as the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. If gains or losses exceed 10 percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, we amortize such gains or losses over the average expected future service period of the employee participants.

We measure our actuarially determined obligations and related costs for our defined benefit pension and other postemployment benefit plans, retiree life insurance and medical benefits, by applying assumptions, the most significant of which include long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates and mortality rates. For the long-term rate of return, we develop our assumptions regarding the expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and projected long-term investment returns, and we weight the assumptions based on each plan’s asset allocation. For the discount rate, we base our assumptions on a yield curve approach using Aa-rated corporate

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued

bonds and the expected timing of future benefit payments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our pension and other postemployment benefit plan obligations represented an aggregate liability of $132 million and $277 million, respectively, and an aggregate asset of $102 million and $37 million, respectively, representing the funded status of the plans. See Note 10—Postemployment Benefit Plans.

Contingencies—We perform assessments of our contingencies on an ongoing basis to evaluate the appropriateness of our liabilities and disclosures for such contingencies. We establish liabilities for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, we adjust the carrying amount of a contingent liability upon the occurrence of a recognizable event when facts and circumstances change, altering our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss. We recognize corresponding assets for those loss contingencies that we believe are probable of being recovered through insurance. We recognize expense for legal costs as they are incurred, and we recognize a corresponding asset for such legal costs only if we expect such legal costs to be recovered through insurance.

Note 3—Accounting Standards Update

Recently adopted accounting standards

Debt with conversion and other options—Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted the accounting standards update that simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments, such as our exchangeable debt, by limiting the accounting models that result in separately recognizing embedded conversion features from the host contract. The accounting standards update also enhances information transparency by making targeted improvements to the disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings per share guidance. Our adoption did not result in any accounting changes for the 0.50% exchangeable senior bonds due January 2023 (the “0.50% Exchangeable Senior Bonds”) or the 2.50% senior guaranteed exchangeable bonds due January 2027 (the “2.50% Senior Guaranteed Exchangeable Bonds”). Under previous accounting guidance, for the 4.00% senior guaranteed exchangeable bonds due December 2025 (the “4.00% Senior Guaranteed Exchangeable Bonds”), we would have recorded the debt and exchange features separately and, consequently, we would have recognized in current and future periods greater amortization, as a component of interest expense. See Note 9—Debt.

Note 4—Unconsolidated Affiliates

Equity investments—We hold noncontrolling equity investments in various unconsolidated companies, including (a) our 33.0 percent ownership interest in Orion Holdings (Cayman) Limited (together with its subsidiary, “Orion”), a Cayman Islands company that, through its wholly owned subsidiary, owns the harsh environment floater Transocean Norge, and (b) our interests in certain companies that are involved in researching and developing technology to improve efficiency, reliability, sustainability and safety for drilling and other activities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate carrying amount of our equity investments was $91 million and $138 million, respectively, recorded in other assets.

Our equity-method investment in Orion is the most significant of our equity investments. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we made an aggregate cash contribution of $8 million and $74 million, respectively, to Orion. In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized a loss of $37 million and $59 million, respectively, which had no tax effect, recorded in other, net, associated with the impairment of our equity investment in Orion upon determination that the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value and that the impairment was other than temporary. We estimated the fair value of our investment by applying the income method using significant unobservable inputs, representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including an assumed discount rate of 12 percent and assumptions about the future performance of the investment, such as future demand and supply for harsh environment floaters, rig utilization, revenue efficiency and dayrates. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate carrying amount of our equity investment in Orion was $57 million and $104 million, respectively.

Related party transactions—We engage in certain related party transactions with our unconsolidated affiliates, the most significant of which are under agreements with Orion. We have a management services agreement for the operation and maintenance of the harsh environment floater Transocean Norge and a marketing services agreement for the marketing of the rig. We also leased the rig under a short-term bareboat charter agreement, which expired in June 2021. Prior to the rig’s placement into service, we also engaged in certain related party transactions with Orion under a shipyard care agreement for the construction of the rig and other matters related to its completion and delivery. Additionally, we procure services and equipment from other unconsolidated affiliates for technological innovation.

In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we received an aggregate cash payment of $16 million, $46 million and $96 million, respectively, under the shipyard care agreement with Orion, primarily related to the commissioning, preparation and mobilization of Transocean Norge. In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized rent expense of $12 million, $22 million and $9 million, respectively, recorded in operating and maintenance costs, and made an aggregate cash payment of $15 million, $22 million and $6 million, respectively, to charter the rig and rent other equipment from Orion. In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we made an aggregate cash payment of $6 million, $15 million and $11 million, respectively, to other unconsolidated affiliates for research and development and for equipment to reduce emissions and improve reliability.

Additionally, in June 2021, Orion refinanced its shipyard loans under a financing arrangement for $100 million, in which we participated at a rate equivalent to our ownership interest in Orion. Borrowings under the financing arrangement are secured by 

AR – 11
TRANSOCEAN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued

Transocean Norge. The financing arrangement, which expires in June 2024, requires interest to be paid on outstanding borrowings at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin of 6.50 percent per annum. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we made a cash investment in loans of $33 million. At December 31, 2021, the outstanding borrowings, including accrued and unpaid interest, due to us under the financing arrangement were $34 million, recorded in other assets.

Note 5—Revenues

Overview—We earn revenues primarily by performing the following activities: (i) providing our drilling rig, work crews, related equipment and services necessary to operate the rig (ii) delivering the drilling rig by mobilizing to and demobilizing from the drill location, and (iii) performing certain pre-operating activities, including rig preparation activities or equipment modifications required for the contract. These services represent a single performance obligation under our drilling contracts with customers that is satisfied over time, the duration of which varies by contract. At December 31, 2021, the drilling contract with the longest expected remaining duration, excluding unexercised options, extends through February 2028.

Disaggregation—Our contract drilling revenues, disaggregated by asset group and by country in which they were earned, were as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Impairments of assets held and used—During the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified indicators that the carrying amounts of our asset groups may not be recoverable. Such indicators included significant declines in commodity prices and the market value of our stock, a reduction of expected demand for our drilling services as our customers announced reductions of capital investments in response to commodity prices and a reduction of projected dayrates. As a result of our testing, we determined that the carrying amount of our midwater floater asset group was impaired. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a loss of $31 million ($0.05 per diluted share), which had no tax effect, associated with the impairment of our midwater floater asset group. We estimated the fair value of the rig and related assets in this asset group by applying the market approach using significant other observable inputs, representative of Level 2 fair value measurements, including the marketability of the rig and prices of comparable rigs that may be sold for scrap value.

Impairments of assets held for sale—In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an aggregate loss of $556 million ($0.90 per diluted share), which had no tax effect, associated with the impairment of the ultra-deepwater floater GSF Development Driller II, the harsh environment floaters Polar Pioneer and Songa Dee and the midwater floaters Sedco 711, Sedco 714 and Transocean 712, along with related assets, which we determined were impaired at the time that we classified the assets as held for sale. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized an aggregate loss of $578 million ($0.94 per diluted share), which had no tax effect, associated with the impairment of the ultra-deepwater floaters Discoverer Deep Seas, Discoverer Enterprise and Discoverer Spirit, along with related assets, which we determined were impaired at the time we classified the assets as held for sale. 

We measured the impairment of the drilling units and related assets as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell. We estimated the fair value of the assets using significant other observable inputs, representative of Level 2 fair value measurements, including indicative market values for the drilling units and related assets to be sold for scrap value or binding contracts to sell such assets for alternative purposes. If we commit to plans to sell additional rigs for values below the respective carrying amounts, we will be required to recognize additional losses in future periods associated with the impairment of such assets.

Dispositions—During the year ended December 31, 2021, in connection with our efforts to dispose of non-strategic assets, we completed the sale of the harsh environment floater Leiv Eiriksson and related assets. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we received aggregate net cash proceeds of $4 million and recognized an aggregate net loss of $57 million ($0.09 per diluted share), which had no tax effect, primarily associated with the disposal of these assets. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we received aggregate net cash proceeds of $5 million and recognized an aggregate net loss of $5 million associated with the disposal of assets unrelated to rig sales.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the sale of the ultra-deepwater floater GSF Development Driller II, the harsh environment floaters Polar Pioneer, Songa Dee and Transocean Arctic and the midwater floaters Sedco 711, Sedco 714 and Transocean 712, along with related assets. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we received aggregate net cash proceeds of $20 million and recognized an aggregate net loss of $61 million ($0.10 per diluted share), which had no tax effect, associated with the disposal of these assets. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we received aggregate net cash proceeds of $4 million and recognized an aggregate net loss of $23 million associated with the disposal of assets unrelated to rig sales.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed the sale of the ultra-deepwater floaters Deepwater Frontier, Deepwater Millennium, Discoverer Deep Seas, Discoverer Enterprise, Discoverer Spirit and Ocean Rig Paros, the harsh environment floater Eirik Raude, the deepwater floaters Jack Bates and Transocean 706 and the midwater floaters Actinia and Songa Delta, along with related assets. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we received aggregate net cash proceeds of $64 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of $4 million ($0.01 per diluted share), which had no tax effect, associated with the disposal of these assets. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we received aggregate net cash proceeds of $6 million and recognized an aggregate net loss of $16 million associated with the disposal of assets unrelated to rig sales.

Cancelled construction contracts—In the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized income of $132 million, recorded in other income, net, associated with the cancellation of certain construction contracts acquired in December 2018 in connection with our acquisition of Ocean Rig UDW Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability, for the construction of two ultra-deepwater drillships. Under the acquisition method of accounting for the business combination, the contract liabilities represented the amount by which the remaining payments due under the acquired contracts were above market construction rates for similar drilling units, measured as of the acquisition date.

Transocean Ltd. and Transocean Inc. are not subject to any significant restrictions on their ability to obtain funds from their consolidated subsidiaries by dividends, loans or capital distributions.

Indentures—The indentures that govern our debt generally contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur certain liens on our drilling units without equally and ratably securing the notes, to engage in certain sale and lease back transactions covering any of our drilling units, to allow our subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt, or to engage in certain merger, consolidation or reorganization transactions or to enter into a scheme of arrangement qualifying as an amalgamation.

The indentures that govern the 5.52% senior secured notes due May 2022 (the “5.52% Senior Secured Notes”), the 5.375% Senior Secured Notes due May 2023 (the “5.375% Senior Secured Notes”), the 5.875% senior secured notes due January 2024, the 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2024, the 6.25% senior secured notes due December 2024, the 6.125% senior secured notes due August 2025 and the 6.875% senior secured notes due February 2027 (the “6.875% Senior Secured Notes”) contain covenants that limit the ability of our subsidiaries that own or operate the collateral rigs to declare or pay dividends to their affiliates.

Credit agreements

Secured Credit Facility—As of December 31, 2021, we have a $1.33 billion secured revolving credit facility established under a bank credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Secured Credit Facility”), which is scheduled to expire on June 22, 2023. The Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by Transocean Ltd. and certain wholly owned subsidiaries. The Secured Credit Facility is secured by, among other things, a lien on the ultra-deepwater floaters Deepwater Asgard, Deepwater Corcovado, Deepwater Invictus, Deepwater Mykonos, Deepwater Orion, Deepwater Skyros, Development Driller III, Dhirubhai Deepwater KG2 and Discoverer Inspiration and the harsh environment floaters Transocean Barents and Transocean Spitsbergen, and at December 31, 2021, the aggregate carrying amount of which was $5.07 billion. The maximum borrowing capacity will be reduced to $1.00 billion if, and so long as, our leverage ratio, measured as the aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, exceeds 10.00 to 1.00. The Secured Credit Facility contains covenants that, among other things, include maintenance of a minimum guarantee coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0, a minimum collateral coverage ratio of 2.1 to 1.0, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio of 0.60 to 1.00 and minimum liquidity of $500 million. The Secured Credit Facility also restricts the ability of Transocean Ltd. and certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, merge, consolidate or otherwise make changes to the corporate structure, incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates and pay dividends and other distributions.

We may borrow under the Secured Credit Facility at either (1) the reserve adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (the “Secured Credit Facility Margin”), which ranges from 2.625 percent to 3.375 percent based on the credit rating of the Secured Credit Facility, or (2) the base rate specified in the credit agreement plus the Secured Credit Facility Margin, minus one percent per annum. Throughout the term of the Secured Credit Facility, we pay a facility fee on the amount of the underlying commitment which ranges from 0.375 percent to 1.00 percent based on the credit rating of the Secured Credit Facility.

The Shipyard Loans are guaranteed by Transocean Inc. Borrowings under the Shipyard Loan for Deepwater Atlas will be secured by, among other security, a lien on the rig. In certain circumstances, borrowings under the Shipyard Loan for Deepwater Titan may also be secured by, among other security, a lien on the rig. We will repay the borrowings, together with interest of 4.5 percent per annum, according to the selected installment schedule over a maximum of a six-year period following delivery of the drilling rigs. We have the right to prepay any outstanding borrowings, in full or in part, without penalty. The Shipyard Loans contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the subsidiary owners of the drilling rigs to incur certain types of additional indebtedness or make certain additional commitments or investments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We periodically review our investment policies, plan assets and asset allocation strategies to evaluate performance relative to specified objectives. In determining our asset allocation strategies for the U.S. Plans, we review the results of regression models to assess the most appropriate target allocation for each plan, given the plan’s status, demographics and duration. For the U.K. Plan, the plan trustees establish the asset allocation strategies consistent with the regulations of the U.K. pension regulators and in consultation with financial advisors and company representatives. Investment managers for the U.S. Plans and the U.K. Plan are given established ranges within which the investments may deviate from the target allocations.

The investments for the funded defined benefit plans were categorized as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We estimated the fair values of the plan assets by applying the market approach, as categorized above, using either (i) significant observable inputs, representative of Level 1 fair value measurements, including market prices of actively traded funds, or (ii) significant other observable inputs, representative of Level 2 fair value measurements, including market prices of the underlying securities in the collective trust funds. The U.S. Plans and the U.K. Plan invest in passively and actively managed funds that are referenced to or benchmarked against market indices. The plan investment managers have discretion to select the securities held within each asset category. Given this discretion, the managers may occasionally invest in our debt or equity securities and may hold either long or short positions in such securities. Since plan investment managers are required to maintain well diversified portfolios, the actual investment in our securities would be immaterial relative to asset categories and the overall plan assets.

Funding contributions and benefit payments—In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we made an aggregate contribution of $10 million, $14 million and $22 million, respectively, to the defined benefit pension plans and the OPEB Plans using our cash flows from operations. In the year ending December 31, 2022, we expect to make an aggregate contribution of $4 million, including $1 million and $3 million to the defined benefit pension plans and the OPEB Plans, respectively.

Note 11—Income Taxes

Overview—Transocean Ltd., a holding company and Swiss resident, is subject to Swiss federal, cantonal and communal income tax. For Swiss income taxes, however, qualifying net dividend income and net capital gains on the sale of qualifying investments in subsidiaries are exempt from taxation. Consequently, there is not a direct relationship between our Swiss earnings before income taxes and our Swiss income tax expense.

Tax provision and rate—In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our effective tax rate was (25.7) percent, (5.1) percent and (4.9) percent, respectively, based on loss before income tax expense. The relationship between our provision for or benefit from income taxes and our income or loss before income taxes can vary significantly from period to period considering, among other factors, (a) the overall level of income before income taxes, (b) changes in the blend of income that is taxed based on gross revenues rather than income before taxes, (c) rig movements between taxing jurisdictions and (d) our rig operating structures.

The components of our income tax provision (benefit) were as follows (in millions):

A reconciliation of the income tax benefit computed at the Swiss holding company federal statutory rate of 7.83% and our reported consolidated income tax expense was as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In January 2020, Switzerland made effective the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“TRAF”), which will subject us to ordinary taxation, effective January 1, 2022, following the expiration of our transition rulings. In November 2021, we reached an agreement with the Swiss tax authorities regarding the manner by which TRAF will apply to certain Swiss subsidiaries, which will allow us to access historic depreciation and costs related to financing assets not previously deducted on Swiss tax returns, which can be apportioned to offset taxable income based on the remaining useful lives of the rigs and financing assets. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a deferred tax liability of $238 million and a deferred tax asset of $1.33 billion, offset with a valuation allowance of $1.17 billion.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, enacted in March 2020, made certain changes to U.S. tax law, including, among others, extending up to five years the carryback period for net operating losses generated between December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an income tax benefit of $28 million related to the carryback of our net operating losses under this provision.

In the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the U.S. base erosion and anti-abuse tax, we recognized income tax expense of $21 million related to the bareboat charter structure of our U.S. operations, a significant portion of which was contractually reimbursed by our customers under a change-in-law provision in our drilling contracts.

Deferred taxes—The significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of December 31, 2021, we include taxes related to the earnings of all of our subsidiaries since we no longer consider the earnings of any of our subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our deferred tax assets included U.S. foreign tax credits of $19 million and $21 million, respectively, which will expire between 2024 and 2031. Deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses were generated in various worldwide tax jurisdictions. At December 31, 2021, our net deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carryforwards included $668 million, which do not expire, and $247 million, which will expire between 2022 and 2038.

As of December 31, 2021, our consolidated cumulative loss incurred over the recent three-year period represented significant objective negative evidence for the evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Although such evidence has limited our ability to consider other subjective evidence, we evaluate each jurisdiction separately. We consider objective evidence, such as contract backlog activity, in jurisdictions in which we have profitable contracts, and the ability to carryback losses or utilize losses against potential exposures. If estimated future taxable income changes during the carryforward periods or if the cumulative loss is no longer present, we may adjust the amount of deferred tax assets that we expect to realize. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, due to uncertainty of realization, we had a valuation allowance of $1.82 billion and $685 million, respectively, on net operating losses and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realization.

Unrecognized tax benefits—The changes to unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties that we recognize as a component of income tax expense, were as follows (in millions):

Our unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties that we recognize as a component of income tax expense, were as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized, as a component of our income tax provision, expense of $8 million, expense of $7 million and benefit of $72 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties associated with our unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2021, we have unrecognized benefits of $435 million, including interest and penalties, against which we have recorded net operating loss deferred tax assets of $320 million, resulting in net unrecognized tax benefits of $115 million, including interest and penalties, that upon reversal would favorably impact our effective tax rate. During the year ending December 31, 2022, it is reasonably possible that our existing liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease, primarily due to the progression of open audits and the expiration of statutes of limitation. However, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in our existing liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to various uncertainties, such as the unresolved nature of various audits.

Tax positions and returns—We conduct operations through our various subsidiaries in countries throughout the world. Each country has its own tax regimes with varying nominal rates, deductions and tax attributes that are subject to changes resulting from new legislation, interpretation or guidance. From time to time, as a result of these changes, we may revise previously evaluated tax positions, which could cause us to adjust our recorded tax assets and liabilities. Tax authorities in certain jurisdictions are examining our tax returns and, in some cases, have issued assessments. We intend to defend our tax positions vigorously. Although we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the aforementioned changes, examinations or assessments, we do not expect the ultimate liability to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position or results of operations; however, it could have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

Brazil tax investigations—In December 2005, the Brazilian tax authorities began issuing tax assessments with respect to our tax returns for the years 2000 through 2004. In May 2014, the Brazilian tax authorities issued an additional tax assessment for the years 2009 and 2010. We filed protests with the Brazilian tax authorities for the assessments and are engaged in the appeals process, and a portion of two cases were favorably closed. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining aggregate tax assessment, including interest and penalties, was for corporate income tax of BRL 638 million, equivalent to approximately $115 million, and indirect tax of BRL 110 million, equivalent to $20 million. We believe our returns are materially correct as filed, and we are vigorously contesting these assessments. An unfavorable outcome on these proposed assessments could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The computation of basic and diluted loss per share was as follows (in millions, except per share data):

In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we excluded from the calculation 12.6 million, 10.8 million and 12.0 million share-based awards, respectively, since the effect would have been anti-dilutive. In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we excluded from the calculation 104.4 million, 84.0 million and 84.0 million shares, respectively, issuable upon conversion of the 0.50% Exchangeable Senior Bonds, the 2.50% Senior Guaranteed Exchangeable Bonds and the 4.00% Senior Guaranteed Exchangeable Bonds since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $18 million and $24 million, respectively, issued under various committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks to guarantee various contract bidding, performance activities and customs obligations. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we also had outstanding surety bonds totaling $146 million and $153 million, respectively, to secure customs obligations related to the importation of our rigs and certain performance and other obligations. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate cash collateral held by institutions to secure our letters of credit and surety bonds was $8 million.

Legal proceedings

Debt exchange litigation and purported notice of default—Prior to the consummation of the 2020 Exchange Transactions (see Note 9—Debt), we completed certain internal reorganization transactions (the “Internal Reorganization”). In September 2020, funds managed by, or affiliated with, Whitebox Advisors LLC (“Whitebox”) as holders of certain series of our notes subject to the 2020 Exchange Offers, filed a claim (the “Claim”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Trial Court”) related to such certain internal reorganization transactions and the 2020 Exchange Offers. Additionally, in September and October 2020, Whitebox and funds managed by, or affiliated with, Pacific Investment Management Company LLC, as debtholders, together with certain other advisors and debtholders, provided purported notices of alleged default with respect to the indentures governing, respectively, the 8.00% Senior Notes and the 7.25% senior notes due November 2025 (the “7.25% Senior Notes”).

On September 23, 2020, we filed an answer to the Claim with the Trial Court and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that, among other matters, the Internal Reorganization did not cause a default under the indenture governing the 8.00% Senior Notes. Concurrently, with our answer and counterclaims, we also submitted a motion for summary judgment seeking an expedited judgment on our request for declaratory judgment. Whitebox subsequently submitted a cross-motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of our counterclaims. On November 30, 2020, while awaiting the Trial Court’s ruling on our motion for summary judgment, we amended certain of our financing documents and implemented certain internal reorganization transactions, which resolved the allegations contained in the purported notices of default. On December 17, 2020, the Trial Court issued its ruling granting our motion for summary judgment and denying the plaintiff’s cross-motion for summary judgment, holding, among other matters, that the allegations contained in the purported notice of default did not constitute a default under the indenture governing the 8.00% Senior Notes. Whitebox has appealed the Trial Court’s ruling.

The facts alleged in the purported notice of default under the 8.00% Senior Notes were the same as the facts underlying the Claim and the purported notice of default under the 7.25% Senior Notes. Accordingly, following the amendment and internal reorganization transactions on November 30, 2020, and the subsequent ruling from the Trial Court granting our motion for summary judgment, we do not expect the liability, if any, resulting from these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 20—Subsequent Event.

Asbestos litigation—In 2004, several of our subsidiaries were named, along with numerous other unaffiliated defendants, in complaints filed in the Circuit Courts of the State of Mississippi, and in 2014, a group of similar complaints were filed in Louisiana. The plaintiffs, former employees of some of the defendants, generally allege that the defendants used or manufactured asbestos containing drilling mud additives for use in connection with drilling operations, claiming negligence, products liability, strict liability and claims allowed under the Jones Act and general maritime law. The plaintiffs generally seek awards of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, but the court-appointed special master has ruled that a Jones Act employer defendant, such as us, cannot be sued for punitive damages. One of our subsidiaries was named in additional complaints filed in Illinois and Missouri, where the plaintiffs similarly allege that the defendants manufactured asbestos containing products or used asbestos-containing drilling mud additives in connection with land-based drilling operations. At December 31, 2021, 11 plaintiffs have claims pending in Louisiana and 9 plaintiffs have claims pending in Illinois and Missouri, in which we have or may have an interest. We intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously, although we can provide no assurance as to the outcome. We historically have maintained broad liability insurance, although we are not certain whether insurance will cover the liabilities, if any, arising out of these claims. Based on our evaluation of the exposure to date, we do not expect the liability, if any, resulting from these claims to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued

One of our subsidiaries was named as a defendant, along with numerous other companies, in lawsuits arising out of the subsidiary’s manufacture and sale of heat exchangers, and involvement in the construction and refurbishment of major industrial complexes alleging bodily injury or personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos. As of December 31, 2021, the subsidiary was a defendant in approximately 250 lawsuits with a corresponding number of plaintiffs. For many of these lawsuits, we have not been provided sufficient information from the plaintiffs to determine whether all or some of the plaintiffs have claims against the subsidiary, the basis of any such claims, or the nature of their alleged injuries. The operating assets of the subsidiary were sold in 1989. In December 2021, the subsidiary and certain insurers agreed to a settlement of outstanding disputes that provide the subsidiary with cash. An earlier settlement, achieved in September 2018, provided the subsidiary with cash and an annuity that begins making payments in 2024. Together with a coverage-in-place agreement with certain insurers and additional coverage issued by other insurers, we believe the subsidiary has sufficient resources to respond to both the current lawsuits as well as future lawsuits of a similar nature. While we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the outcome of these matters, we do not expect the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from these claims to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Macondo well incident—In June 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (the “MDL Court”) released the then-remaining $125 million of assets held in the escrow account established to satisfy our remaining obligations under the settlement agreement that we and the Plaintiff Steering Committee filed in May 2015 with the MDL Court, in which most claims against us for damages related to the blowout of the Macondo well in April 2010 were consolidated by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Following the release of assets, all significant litigation, including civil and criminal claims, resulting from the Macondo well incident had been resolved.

Other matters—We are involved in various regulatory matters and a number of claims and lawsuits, asserted and unasserted, all of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. We do not expect the liability, if any, resulting from these other matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any of the litigation matters specifically described above or of any such other pending, threatened, or possible litigation or liability. We can provide no assurance that our beliefs or expectations as to the outcome or effect of any tax, regulatory, lawsuit or other litigation matter will prove correct and the eventual outcome of these matters could materially differ from management’s current estimates.

Environmental matters

We have certain potential liabilities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar state acts regulating cleanup of hazardous substances at various waste disposal sites, including those described below. CERCLA is intended to expedite the remediation of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. It is difficult to quantify the potential cost of environmental matters and remediation obligations. Liability is strict and can be joint and several.

One of our subsidiaries was named as a PRP in connection with a site located in Santa Fe Springs, California, known as the Waste Disposal, Inc. site. We and other PRPs agreed, under a participation agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the U.S. Department of Justice, to settle our potential liabilities by remediating the site. The remedial action for the site was completed in 2006. Our share of the ongoing operating and maintenance costs has been insignificant, and we do not expect any additional potential liabilities to be material. Resolutions of other claims by the EPA, the involved state agency or PRPs are at various stages of investigation. Nevertheless, based on available information with respect to all environmental matters, including all related pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims that are likely to be asserted, we do not expect the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from such matters, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 14—Equity

Share issuance—In June 2021, we commenced an at the market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) with no expected expiration. On June 14, 2021, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with a sales agent for the offer and sale of our shares, with up to a maximum aggregate net offering price of $400 million, under the ATM Program. We intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things the repayment or refinancing of indebtedness and the funding of working capital, capital expenditures, investments and additional balance sheet liquidity. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we received aggregate cash proceeds of $158 million, net of issue costs, for the aggregate sale of 36.1 million shares, under the ATM Program.

Shares held by subsidiaries—One of our subsidiaries holds our shares for future use to deliver shares in connection with sales under the ATM Program and in connection with awards granted under our incentive plans or other rights to acquire our shares. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our subsidiary held 72.7 million and 24.5 million shares, respectively.

Note 15—Share-Based Compensation

Overview

We have a long-term incentive plan (the “Long-Term Incentive Plan”) for executives, key employees and non-employee directors under which awards can be granted in the form of restricted share units, restricted shares, stock options, stock appreciation rights and cash performance awards. Awards may be granted as service awards that are earned over a defined service period or as performance awards that are earned based on the achievement of certain market factors or performance targets or a combination of market factors and performance targets. The compensation committee of our board of directors determines the terms and conditions of the awards granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. At December 31, 2021, we had 85.7 million shares authorized and 30.0 million shares available to be granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. At December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to our unvested share-based awards was $29 million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

Service awards typically vest either in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary date of the grant or in an aggregate installment at the end of the stated vesting period. Service-based stock options, once fully vested, are typically exercisable during a seven-year period. Performance awards typically vest in one aggregate installment following the ultimate determination date. Performance awards are typically subject to a three-year measurement period during which the number of shares to be issued remains uncertain until the end of the performance period, at which time the awarded number of shares to be issued is determined.

Service awards

Restricted share units—A restricted share unit is a notional unit that is equal to one share but has no voting rights until the underlying share is issued. The following table summarizes unvested activity during the year ended December 31, 2021 for service-based units granted under our incentive plan:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the year ended December 31, 2021, the vested service-based units had an aggregate grant-date fair value of $16 million. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we granted 7,093,421 and 3,044,494 service-based units, respectively, with a per unit weighted-average grant-date fair value of $1.41 and $8.33, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 2,817,155 and 2,224,030 service-based units, respectively, that vested with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $24 million and $23 million, respectively.

Stock options—The following table summarizes activity during the year ended December 31, 2021 for vested and unvested service-based stock options outstanding under our incentive plan:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the vested stock options had an aggregate grant-date fair value of $9 million, $12 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were outstanding unvested stock options to purchase 482,688 and 1,355,448 shares, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we granted stock options to purchase 1,594,528 shares with a per option weighted-average grant-date fair value of $8.35.

Performance awards

Restricted share units—We grant performance awards in the form of restricted share units that can be earned depending on the achievement of market factors and performance targets. The number of shares ultimately earned per unit is quantified upon completion of

See Note 9—Debt.

(c)In connection with the issuance of the 2.50% Senior Guaranteed Exchangeable Bonds, we recorded the conversion feature, measured at its estimated fair value, to additional paid-in capital. See Note 9—Debt.

Note 18—Financial Instruments

Overview—The carrying amounts and fair values of our financial instruments were as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash and cash equivalents—Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in demand deposits, short-term time deposits and money market funds. The carrying amount of our cash and cash equivalents represents the historical cost, plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value because of the short maturities of the instruments.

Restricted cash and cash equivalents—Our restricted cash and cash equivalents, which are subject to restrictions due to collateral requirements, legislation, regulation or court order, are primarily invested in demand deposits and money market funds. The carrying amount of our restricted cash and cash equivalents represents the historical cost, plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value because of the short maturities of the instruments.

Long-term loans receivable from unconsolidated affiliates—The carrying amount of our long-term loans receivable from unconsolidated affiliates, recorded in other assets, represents the principal amount of the cash investment. We estimated the fair value of our long-term loans receivable from unconsolidated affiliates using significant unobservable inputs, representative of Level 3 fair value measurements, including the terms and credit spreads for the instruments.

Total debt—The carrying amount of our total debt represents the principal amount, contractual interest payments of previously restructured debt and unamortized discounts, premiums and issue costs. The carrying amount and fair value of our total debt includes amounts related to certain exchangeable debt instruments (see Note 9—Debt). We estimated the fair value of our total debt using significant other observable inputs, representative of Level 2 fair value measurements, including the terms and credit spreads for the instruments and, with respect to the exchangeable debt instruments, the expected volatility of the market price for our shares.

Note 19—Risk Concentration

Interest rate risk—We are exposed to the interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate debt when we refinance maturing debt with new debt or when we early retire debt in open market repurchases, exchanges or other market transactions. We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents, as the interest income earned on these investments is based on variable or short-term interest rates, which change with market interest rates.

Currency exchange rate risk—We are exposed to currency exchange rate risk primarily related to employee compensation costs and purchasing costs that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. dollar. We use a variety of techniques to minimize the exposure to currency exchange rate risk, including the structuring of customer contract payment terms and occasional use of forward exchange contracts. Our primary tool to manage currency exchange rate risk involves structuring customer contracts to provide 

AR – 30
TRANSOCEAN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued

for payment in both U.S. dollars and local currency. The payment portion denominated in local currency is based on anticipated local currency requirements over the contract term. Due to various factors, including customer acceptance, local banking laws, national content requirements, other statutory requirements, local currency convertibility, local inflation and revenue efficiency, actual local currency needs may vary from those realized in the customer contracts, resulting in partial exposure to currency exchange rate risk. The currency exchange effect resulting from our international operations generally has not had a material impact on our operating results.

Credit risk—We are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily related to our restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and customer receivables, both current and long-term. We generally maintain our restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in time deposits at commercial banks with high credit ratings or mutual funds, which invest exclusively in high-quality money market instruments, and we limit the amount of exposure to any one institution and do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk. Regarding our customer receivables, which are dispersed in various countries, we earn our revenues by providing our drilling services to integrated energy companies, government-owned or government-controlled energy companies and other independent energy companies. We establish an allowance for credit losses by applying an expected loss rate based on current and forecasted future and historical experience. Although we have encountered only isolated credit concerns related to independent energy companies, we occasionally require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. In certain instances, when we determine that collection is not reasonably assured, we may occasionally offer extended payment terms and recognize revenues associated with the contract on a cash basis.

Labor agreements—At December 31, 2021, we had a global workforce of approximately 5,530 individuals, including approximately 530 contractors. Approximately 42 percent of our total workforce, working primarily in Norway, Brazil and the U.K., are represented by, and some of our contracted labor work is subject to, collective bargaining agreements, substantially all of which are subject to annual salary negotiation. Negotiations over annual salary or other labor matters could result in higher personnel or other costs or increased operational restrictions or disruptions. The outcome of any such negotiation generally affects the market for all offshore employees, not only union members. A failure to reach an agreement on certain key issues could result in strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages.
