﻿ 

CORNING, N.Y. — Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) today announced fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 results and provided its outlook for first-quarter and full-year 2022. 

“Corning delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year growth. For full-year 2021, we exceeded $14 billion in sales and $2 in EPS. We nearly doubled free cash flow, increased our dividend by 9%, and reduced outstanding shares by 5% through the resumption of share repurchases. By leveraging our core capabilities and ‘More Corning’ strategy, we are capturing a compelling set of short- and long-term opportunities across our portfolio,” said Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer. 

Weeks continued, “We achieved double-digit ROIC and expanded our operating margin by 230 basis points; however, our gross margin is not where it should be. We are focused on expanding gross margin and expect improvement in 2022 as sales grow and our price actions take hold throughout the year.” 

Financial Highlights: 

    •   Fourth-quarter GAAP and core sales were $3.7 billion, with core sales up 12% year over year. Full-year GAAP and core sales were $14.1 billion; core sales grew 23% year over year, led by Optical Communications, Display, Life Sciences, and Hemlock Semiconductor Group.    

    •   Fourth-quarter GAAP EPS was $0.56 and core EPS was $0.54; full-year GAAP EPS was $1.28 and core EPS was $2.07.    

    •   Fourth-quarter core gross margin was 36.5%, down 180 basis points sequentially. As expected, below-normal automotive production, seasonally lower sales in Specialty Materials, and inflationary headwinds reduced profitability. In addition, Hemlock Semiconductor Group incurred temporary startup costs as it restarted polysilicon capacity to support new long-term solar contracts. Full-year core gross margin expanded 110 basis points to 37.1%.    

    •   Fourth-quarter free cash flow was $425 million; full-year free cash flow was $1.8 billion, with free cash flow conversion of 97%.    

    •   Display glass pricing is expected to be flat sequentially in the first quarter of 2022. The supply-demand balance for display glass is tight. In 2022, management expects overall glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable.   

   • For the first quarter, Corning expects core sales to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion with core EPS of $0.48 to $0.53. For 2022, management expects sales of approximately $15 billion and profit to grow faster than sales; capital expenditures are expected to remain at approximately the 2021 level.   

Tony Tripeny, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said, “In 2021, we grew significantly year over year, with all segments adding sales and four out of five logging double-digit percentage increases. It was a strong year, even compared to pre-pandemic levels. Since 2019, we have grown sales by 21% and EPS by 18%. As we discussed throughout 2021, freight, logistics, and raw material costs along with lower automotive sales due to chip shortages impacted our margins. Over the last several months, we negotiated with our customers to increase prices in our contracts to share increased costs more appropriately. The revised pricing terms take effect throughout 2022, and we expect gross margin to expand accordingly.”

In December, Corning announced the appointment of Edward Schlesinger to CFO, effective Feb. 18, 2022, and the retirement of Tripeny. 

Schlesinger, currently serving as senior vice president and corporate controller, said, “It has been a privilege to work alongside Tony for the past decade. Looking ahead, Corning is well positioned to deliver significant advancements and growth in each of its Market-Access Platforms. Creating value for shareholders and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation remain our top priorities.” 

Market-Access Platform Highlights: 

Corning holds a leadership position in each of the markets addressed by its five Market-Access Platforms. Throughout 2021, the company grew in all segments and advanced important growth initiatives and strategic partnerships with industry leaders. 

 • Optical Communications – Optical Communications sales grew 22% year over year to $4.3 billion. Growth was supported by increased spending in broadband, 5G, and cloud computing. Corning seeks to consistently create new products and extend its leadership by delivering passive optical solutions that increase network capability and reduce deployment time and cost. Notable innovations and partnerships during 2021 included the introduction of Corning® SMF-28® Contour fiber, which offers an industry-first combination of superior bendability, compatibility with other fibers, and low signal loss; the launch of EDGE™ Rapid Connect solutions, which are designed to help hyperscale customers interconnect their data centers up to 70% faster than legacy cabling methods; and the expansion of 5G collaboration with Verizon to include indoor mmWave sites and edge deployments in Corning’s largest cable plant. Management expects significant growth in 2022 and beyond, including from the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provides for broadband deployment to benefit underserved and unserved communities.   

 • Life Sciences – The company is driving more Corning content into the market, delivering all-time-high Life Sciences segment sales of more than $1.2 billion in 2021 – up 24% year over year. Growth was driven by strong ongoing demand to support the global pandemic response, research labs reopening following pandemic-driven closures, and continued growth in bioproduction. The company also introduced Corning Velocity® Vials to help drive faster manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and meet global demand. Velocity Vials join Corning Valor® Glass vials and pharmaceutical glass tubing as the company builds its comprehensive, end-to-end pharmaceutical packaging portfolio. To date, across that portfolio, Corning has enabled the delivery of nearly 5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines. In support of global demand, the company began production in two new facilities – manufacturing pharmaceutical-grade vials in Durham, North Carolina, and tubing in Bengbu, China. Additionally, West Pharmaceutical Services recently announced a long-term supply agreement and multimillion-dollar technology investment in Corning to enhance injectable-drug packaging systems. In total, Corning enters 2022 with a significantly larger global footprint in Life Sciences and expects continued growth.   

 • Automotive – In 2021, Environmental Technologies sales grew 16%, driven by strength in heavy duty, to reach an all-time-high $1.6 billion, despite weakness in the automotive market related to chip shortages. The company also captured “More Corning” opportunities with its precision glass technology, including the Mercedes-Benz EQS that features the MBUX Hyperscreen with Corning Gorilla Glass for Automotive Interiors. Corning entered a new product category with its Corning® Curved Mirror Solutions, which are deployed in Hyundai Mobis’ head-up display system. Jeep and Corning announced that a windshield with Corning® Gorilla® Glass is available as a factory-installed option on the Jeep® Wrangler and Jeep® Gladiator. Looking ahead to 2022, Corning continues to address a combined $100-per-car content opportunity. Gasoline particulate filters (GPFs) remain a critical component of that strategy, and next-generation GPFs are now shipping to customers as OEMs seek to meet tailpipe particulate emissions standards. Corning is also innovating and ramping products to provide advantaged precision glass and optics solutions for autonomous vehicles.   

 • Mobile Consumer Electronics – 2021 Specialty Materials sales grew 7% and surpassed $2 billion for the first time. Since 2016, the segment has added approximately $900 million in revenue on a base of slightly more than $1.1 billion. Corning® Gorilla® Glass is the clear market leader. Corning consistently advances state-of-the-art premium glasses and enhances devices with glass backs and its Gorilla Glass DX family of surface treatments, which improve durability and optics for wearables, laptops, and smartphone camera lens covers. In addition, Corning’s Advanced Optics business is growing rapidly. Advanced Optics provides optics for DUV and EUV photolithography tools for semiconductor manufacturing as well as the world’s most advanced inspection systems. The business is benefitting from strong semiconductor wafer fab equipment spending, and Corning continues to invest to support continued semiconductor-related growth.

 • Display – 2021 sales grew 17% to $3.7 billion. The company experienced the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade. In 2021, Corning’s display glass volume growth exceeded glass market growth, as the company ramped up its Gen 10.5 facilities that supply glass for large-size TVs, which are expected to grow at a high-teen percentage CAGR over the next several years. In 2022, Corning expects overall glass supply to remain tight to balanced and pricing to remain favorable, supported by growth in the retail market as TV unit sales increase and screen size grows.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

﻿ 

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES  

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements are adjusted to exclude specific items to arrive at core performance measures. These items include gains and losses on translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments, restructuring, impairment losses, and other charges and credits, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Corning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, new Taiwan dollar and the euro. The Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on earnings and cash flows. Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by the management team to make financial and operational decisions. 

Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not, be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the Company’s outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis. 

For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures”.

(b) Corning and Samsung Display Co., Ltd. executed a Share Repurchase Agreement ("SRA"). Pursuant to the SRA, the Series A convertible preferred stock ("Preferred Stock") was converted into 115 million shares of common stock ("Common Shares"). Corning immediately repurchased 35 million of the converted Common Shares and excluded them from the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the calculation of the Company’s basic and diluted earnings per share. The redemption of these Common Shares resulted in an $803 million reduction of retained earnings which reduced the net income available to common shareholders.
