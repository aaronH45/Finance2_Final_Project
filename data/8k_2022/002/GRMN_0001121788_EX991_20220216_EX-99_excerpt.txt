Executive Overview from Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer:  

“2021 was another remarkable year as demand for our products led to strong double digit annual revenue growth in each of our five segments,” said Cliff Pemble, President and CEO of Garmin. “We are entering 2022 with a great lineup of recently introduced products and have more exciting product introductions planned throughout the year. I am very proud of what we have accomplished in 2021 and look forward to the opportunities and challenges of the new year.”  

Fitness: 

Revenue from the fitness segment was flat in the fourth quarter, with growth in advanced wearable products offset by reduced sales of cycling products. Gross margin and operating margins were 49% and 22%, respectively, resulting in $104 million of operating income. During the quarter, we announced multiyear sponsorship agreements at both the high school and collegiate levels to showcase the power and utility of our running watches. We also recently released our 2021 Connect Fitness Report which shows double digit growth in nearly every activity category, demonstrating the unique active lifestyle focus of our customer base.  

Outdoor: 

Revenue from the outdoor segment decreased 8% in the fourth quarter primarily due to component constraints that limited the number of orders we could fulfill for our traditional handhelds and dog products. Gross margin and operating margins were 65% and 37%, respectively, resulting in $142 million of operating income. The Garmin Descent Mk2i dive computer and Descent T1 transmitter featuring our revolutionary SubWave sonar-based communication were named one of 2021’s greatest innovations by Popular Science.  

Aviation: 

Revenue from the aviation segment grew 13% in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the OEM category. Gross margin and operating margins were 73% and 25%, respectively, resulting in $45 million of operating income. During the quarter the G3000 integrated flight deck was selected by Heart Aerospace for the all-electric ES-19 regional airliner. We also announced additional certifications for our GFC 500/600 autopilot, bringing the performance and safety enhancing benefits of our flight control technology to more aircraft models. Also in the quarter, Embraer presented Garmin with its seventh consecutive Supplier of the Year award. Over the past decade, Embraer has presented Garmin with a total of 12 supplier awards across various categories, including: Electric and Electronics Systems, Technical Support to Operators, Electro- Mechanical Systems, and Material Support to Operator, recognizing our achievement in designing, manufacturing, and supporting the most innovative flight deck solutions. 

Marine: 

Revenue from the marine segment grew 14% in the fourth quarter with growth across multiple categories led by strong demand for our chartplotters. Gross margin and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively, resulting in $39 million of operating income. During the quarter, we launched the new GPSMAP 79 marine handheld series, equipping mariners with easy-to-use navigation tools in the palm of their hand. We also launched the new GMR Fantom range, the most powerful solid-state dome radars in their class. These high-powered radars offer a broad range from 20 feet to 48 nautical miles, improved target detection and features to enhance situational awareness on the water. Also during the quarter, our Surround View Camera System was named the 2021 DAME Design award winner as the industry first intelligent camera system delivering unprecedented situational awareness and convenience on the water.  

Auto: 

Revenue from the auto segment grew 21% during the fourth quarter driven by growth in both auto OEM programs and consumer auto products. Gross margin was 36%, and we recorded an operating loss of $15 million in the quarter driven by ongoing investments in auto OEM programs. During the quarter, we began shipments of the new lineup of Drive navigators for the consumer market, bringing larger displays and more connected features to our customers.  

Additional Financial Information: 

Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $457 million, a 9% increase over the prior year. Research and development increased by 11%, primarily due to engineering personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10%, driven primarily by personnel related expenses and information technology costs. Advertising expenses were consistent with the prior year quarter. 

The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 7.4% compared to the GAAP effective tax rate of 14.8% and pro forma effective tax rate(1) of 12.0% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to uncertain tax position reserves recorded in the prior year. 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we generated approximately $49 million of free cash flow(1), and paid a quarterly dividend of approximately $129 million. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.1 billion.

The following table includes supplemental financial information for the consumer auto and auto OEM operating segments that management believes is useful. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Changes in Expense Classification and Segment Allocation Methodologies 

Beginning with reports filed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company will reflect a refined methodology used in classifying certain indirect costs in accordance with the way the Company's management will use the information in decision making, which we believe will provide a more meaningful representation of costs incurred to support research and development activities. Future reports will also reflect a refined methodology used to allocate certain selling, general, and administrative expenses to the segments in a more direct manner to provide a more meaningful representation of segment profit or loss. 

These changes in classification and allocation had no effect on the Company's consolidated operating or net income or on the Company's composition of operating segments and reportable segments. The Company expects to report its financial results in accordance with these changes beginning with the Company's first quarter 2022 Form 10-Q and will recast prior periods to conform to the revised presentation. 

 We estimate the expense classification change will result in a decrease to research and development expense of approximately $61 million, with a corresponding increase to selling, general, and administrative expenses, for the recast fiscal year ended December 25, 2021. 

We estimate the segment allocation change will result in the following impacts to segment operating income for the recast fiscal year ended December 25, 2021:

Non-GAAP Financial Information 

To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: pro forma effective tax rate, pro forma net income (earnings) per share and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparison with other companies. Management believes providing investors with an operating view consistent with how it manages the Company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the Company, as described in more detail by category below.  

The tables below provide reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures. 

Pro forma effective tax rate 

The Company’s income tax expense is periodically impacted by discrete tax items that are not reflective of income tax expense incurred as a result of current period earnings. Therefore, management believes disclosure of the effective tax rate and income tax provision before the effect of certain discrete tax items are important measures to permit investors' consistent comparison between periods. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Pro forma net income (earnings) per share 

Management believes that net income (earnings) per share before the impact of foreign currency gains or losses and certain discrete income tax items, as discussed above, is an important measure in order to permit a consistent comparison of the Company’s performance between periods. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Free cash flow 

Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure because it represents the amount of cash provided by operations that is available for investing and defines it as operating cash flows less capital expenditures for property and equipment. Management believes that excluding purchases of property and equipment provides a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s operations and allows more accurate comparisons of the Company’s results between periods. This metric may also be useful to investors, but should not be considered in isolation as it is not a measure of cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. The most comparable GAAP measure is net cash provided by operating activities. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Forward-looking Financial Measures 

The forward-looking financial measures in our 2022 guidance provided above do not consider the potential future net effect of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, certain discrete tax items and any other impacts that may be identified as pro forma adjustments in calculating the non-GAAP measures described above. 

The estimated impact of foreign currency gains and losses cannot be reasonably estimated on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the related tax effects of such gains and losses. The impact on diluted net income per share of foreign currency gains and losses, net of tax effects, was $0.21 per share for the 52-weeks ended December 25, 2021. 

At this time, management is unable to determine whether or not significant discrete tax items will occur in fiscal 2022 or anticipate the impact of any other events that may be considered in the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures.
