Coty Reports Strong 2Q22 Across All Metrics, With Significant Momentum Into 3Q22

 Strong Sales and Sell-Out Momentum in 1H22, Fueled by U.S., China and Travel Retail

Consumer Beauty Accelerates Growth And Gains Market Share

Leverage Below 5x Exiting CY21, Ahead of Expectations 

Robust Gross Margin Expansion Fuel Media Reinvestment and Profit Growth

 FY22 Sales Expected at Upper End of Guidance Range, with Adjusted EPS Outlook Higher

NEW YORK - February 8, 2022-- Coty Inc. (NYSE: COTY) ("Coty" or "the Company") today announced its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, ended December 31, 2021. The results represented another quarter of solid financial improvement and continued strong delivery across its strategic growth pillars.

In Q2, Coty's sales increased 12% as reported and LFL, in-line with its prior guidance of low-teens LFL growth year-on-year, following the strong sales growth during Q1 as Coty shipped key launches including Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia, Burberry Hero and the relaunch of the full Kylie Cosmetics range. With each of these launches strongly resonating in-market and the Consumer Beauty business gaining sales growth momentum and market share, the total Coty sell-out improved in Q2. As a result, both sales and sell-out in 1H22 saw mid-teens growth, with January LFL sales accelerating from Q2 levels to +13%. 

Coty's Prestige segment generated solid 12% reported and LFL growth in Q2, and 21% in 1H22. Prestige fragrance sales continued to grow at a double-digit pace in Q2, with nearly all brands contributing, particularly Gucci, Burberry, Chloe, and Hugo Boss. Encouragingly, Coty's key launches saw strong in-market success, with Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia and Burberry Hero among the top launches in the U.S. market and in China, including on Tmall. Simultaneously, Prestige cosmetics sales nearly doubled in 1H22, led by global momentum in Gucci makeup and the continued expansion of Kylie Cosmetics following the relaunch over the summer. Regionally, the 1H22 performance was largely broad based as the U.S. and China delivered double digit growth, Travel Retail more than doubled, and many European markets continued to recover. 

Consumer Beauty revenues increased 11% as reported and 12% LFL in Q2, and grew by 8% as reported and LFL in 1H22. The early success of Coty's strategy to stabilize and grow its Consumer Beauty business is evident in the latest measured market share data, in which Coty grew its market share on a global basis for the first time in 5 years. This was underpinned by market share gains across all 4 key color cosmetics brands - CoverGirl, Rimmel, Sally Hansen and Max Factor - as the new brand equities, communications, and product launches resonated with consumers. 

During the quarter, Coty's virtuous circle continued to take hold with significant gross margin expansion and further cost reductions allowing the Company to grow profit while simultaneously reinvesting in media to fuel sell-out growth. Q2 reported gross margins expanded by 570 bps YoY to 64.4%, while adjusted gross margin grew 590 bps YoY and 120bps QoQ to 64.6%, despite inflationary headwinds. This robust gross margin expansion was driven by favorable product and category mix, pricing, improved excess & obsolescence, and higher absorption. In addition, Coty continued to lower its cost base, with year-over-year savings of over $40 million in Q2, bringing total YTD savings to close to $100M. Coty delivered Q2 reported operating income of $244.0 million and adjusted EBITDA of $311.9 million. 1H22 reported operating income totaled $261.2 million and adjusted EBITDA totaled $590.4 million, reflecting over 30% growth YoY, ahead of guidance. 

Financial Net Debt improved by approximately $500 million to just under $4.5 billion at the end of Q2, fueled by strong free cash flow generation and real estate divestitures. As a result, the financial leverage ratio of 4.9x at the end of CY21 was ahead of expectations. With an increase in the value of Coty's 26% Wella stake to approximately $1.18 billion at quarter-end, the Company's Economic Net Debt totaled approximately $3.3 billion.

Commenting on the operating results, Sue Y. Nabi, Coty's CEO, said: 

"With our 1H22 now complete, I am very pleased to say that the year is shaping up as we had hoped, and in many respects even better. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic growth pillars, allowing us to deliver sales, profit, and leverage results inline or ahead of guidance for the sixth consecutive quarter. The second quarter, and even more so the first half, further illustrates the virtuous cycle we have created. Strong topline growth combined with gross margin expansion and strong cost execution are generating both profit growth and re-

1

investment in the business in the most promising opportunities. This combination has contributed to sequentially improving sell-out trends in Q2, which sets the stage for accelerating sales growth in the second half. Importantly, we also delivered on our leverage target goals, ending CY21 with financial net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of below 5x, and we are already making strong strides toward our CY22 leverage target of approximately 4x with the expected $175 million of shareholder distribution from Wella.

Q2 marked another quarter of progress across each of our six strategic pillars. I am extremely proud to say that the repositioning of Consumer Beauty brands is generating success. For the first time in 5 years, all 4 of our top cosmetics brands - CoverGirl, Rimmel, Sally Hansen, and Max Factor - are gaining market share on a global basis, fueling market share gains for the overall Consumer Beauty business. While the path to sustained Consumer Beauty expansion may not be linear, these strong results confirm that our Consumer Beauty brands are as relevant as ever and with the right products, communication strategy, in-store execution and teams, we can truly excel. 

Trends within our Prestige fragrance portfolio remained strong, with double digit sell-out growth and strategic launches like Gucci Flora and Burberry Hero already on track to become global icons. At the same time, the success of Gucci makeup and continued expansion of Kylie cosmetics are further cementing Coty's position within prestige cosmetics. Meanwhile, Q2 was a busy quarter in relation to our skincare ambitions, as we announced the license of the Orveda brand and the launch of CoverGirl skincare, and hired Dr. Shimei Fan as our Chief Scientific Officer, all while solidifying Lancaster's position in China through new door openings and innovative activations. In digital, we are leading with social commerce across each region, fueling a truly omnichannel approach with our retailer partners. In China, we have maintained double digit growth, even as COVID restrictions weighed on market growth in the short term, with our Prestige sell-out growth 6 times higher than the prestige beauty market. Finally, on sustainability, we completed a comprehensive footprint analysis ex-Wella, which will serve as the baseline for more ambitious sustainability targets in line with the Science Based Target initiative.

The strong business trajectory of the first half of the year and continuing through January gives us confidence in our outlook for the second half of FY22. Therefore, we now expect our FY22 LFL sales growth to be towards the higher end of our guidance range of low-to-mid teens LFL growth. We continue to anticipate the impact of inflation to step up in the second half of FY22, and we expect to fully offset this through a combination of mix management, pricing, and cost savings. As we navigate through this dynamic environment, we remain confident in achieving FY22 constant currency adjusted EBITDA of $900 million at a minimum, while increasing our adjusted EPS outlook to $0.22-0.26. 

Our short-term and medium-term ambitions remain fully on track, as we continue to transform Coty into a true global beauty powerhouse."

1Based on fair market value, reflecting the Wella capital structure as of December 31, 2021

•2Q22 reported EPS was $0.23. Adjusted EPS of $0.17, improved from $0.13 last year, including a 2 cent discrete tax benefit in the quarter.

•Cost reductions remained solid with over $40 million of additional reductions, bringing YTD total savings close to $100 million. 

•2Q22 free cash flow of $408.0 million improved by $18.6 million from last year driven by higher net income on a cash basis.

Outlook

2

The strong sales and sell-out momentum in 1H22, extending through January with LFL sales growth of +13%, reinforces Coty's confidence that FY22 LFL sales will be at the upper end of its guidance range of low-to-mid teens percentage growth. Based on current FX rates, Coty expects a headwind of 3-4% to its reported sales in 2H22.

The Company continues to expect FY22 adjusted of EBITDA of $900 million at a minimum, on a constant currency basis, as Coty navigates the inflationary environment while intentionally reinvesting gross margin gains and costs savings in its brands to maximize value and fuel sustained topline growth. This reflects strong EBITDA margin expansion YoY. Based on current FX rates, Coty expects a negligible FX impact to its FY22 adjusted EBITDA outlook, as FX benefits in 1H22 are offset by FX headwinds in 2H22.

With the strong Q2 EPS delivery, Coty raises its FY22 adjusted EPS guidance to $0.22-0.26, up from its previously guided range of $0.20-0.24. The FY22 adjusted EPS guidance includes approximately 1 cent of net discrete tax benefits expected for the year.

In addition, the Company continues to target leverage of approximately 4x exiting CY22. Given Wella has completed a refinancing of its existing debt in order to fund a shareholder distribution, the expected $175 million distribution from Wella represents a strong contribution towards this target. Coty continues to target leverage of approximately 2x exiting CY25.

Second Quarter Business Review by Segment*

Prestige

In 2Q22, Prestige net revenues of $1,008.0 million or 64% of Coty sales, increased by 12% versus the prior year. On a LFL basis, Prestige net revenues delivered robust growth of 12%, driven by strength across all regions including continued rebound of market growth in most EMEA markets, Travel Retail, China, and the U.S.

During 2Q, U.S. Prestige fragrance sell-out continued to generate stellar growth, increasing over 40% versus last year. Performance continued to be particularly favorable for Burberry, Gucci, Marc Jacobs, and Chloe. Importantly, Coty's recent key innovations, notably Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia and Burberry Hero, also continue to deliver very strong sell-out performance and are amongst the top selling fragrance innovations in key markets. In EMEA, Prestige fragrances showed further improvement in 2Q22. In China, fragrance sell-out showed strong double-digit growth in the quarter, which was supported by the strength of recent launches, including Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia which ranked as a top 7 fragrance on Tmall in December.

Additionally, Coty continued to make progress further expanding into Prestige cosmetics and skincare in the quarter. Prestige cosmetics sales nearly doubled in both Q2 and 1H22, fueled by Gucci makeup and Kylie cosmetics. In skincare, the Company continued to build the foundations for acceleration in the segment, including strengthening Lancaster's brand image in Hainan and mainland China through innovative activations and continued distribution expansion. 

The Prestige segment generated a reported operating income of $141.6 million in 2Q22, compared to $110.8 million in the prior year. The 2Q22 adjusted operating income was $182.0 million, up from an adjusted operating income of $160.6 million in the prior year, driven by gross margin improvement, partially offset by higher working media expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the Prestige segment rose to $219.0 million from $199.4 million in the prior year, with a margin of 21.7%.

Consumer Beauty

In 2Q22, Consumer Beauty net revenues of $570.2 million, or 36% of Coty sales, increased by 11% versus the prior year. On a LFL basis, Consumer Beauty net revenue growth accelerated to 12%. Encouragingly, all regions generated double-digit LFL growth in the quarter. From a category perspective, color cosmetics led, with LFL growth in the mid-teens.

During the quarter, for the first time in 5 years the total Coty Consumer Beauty business gained market share, driven by particularly strong performance of color cosmetics, which grew in share by over 1 point. In the U.S., CoverGirl continues to show that the brand is on a sustainable path of improvement and growth as it has grown or maintained share in 6 of the last 9 months since the new brand equity was launched. Meanwhile, Sally Hansen remains strong as it gained share through the quarter and sell-out remains ahead of pre-pandemic levels.

In Europe, Coty grew market share for the first time in two years, which was supported by the re-positioning efforts behind Rimmel and Max Factor. In the UK, Rimmel continues to lead the market with share increasing, supported by particularly strong e-commerce trends. Meanwhile, Max Factor continued to take share across many key markets including the UK, Spain, Czech Republic, and Poland. 

The Consumer Beauty reported operating income was $43.3 million in 2Q22, an increase from $30.4 million in the prior year. The 2Q22 adjusted operating income of $54.3 million increased from $42.4 million in the prior year, driven by a higher gross margin and solid fixed cost reductions, partially offset by a reinvestment in marketing expenses, particularly towards working media. During the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $92.9 million from $85.1 million in the prior year, with a margin of 16.3%.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Business Review by Region*

Americas 

•In 2Q22, Americas net revenues of $587.0 million, or 37% of Coty sales, increased 9% as reported and LFL. This was driven by strong growth of both Prestige and Consumer Beauty. The Prestige performance continued to benefit from particularly robust fragrance category trends in the U.S., coupled with the solid performance of Coty's recent fragrance innovations, with Gucci Flora the #1 fragrance launch in the U.S. 

5

and Canada, and Burberry Hero the #4 male launch in the U.S. for all of CY21. CoverGirl also exhibited strong growth, gaining market share in the quarter, while Sally Hansen also gained share.

EMEA

•In 2Q22, EMEA net revenues of $795.0 million, or 50% of Coty sales, increased 12% as reported and 13% LFL. Similar to the Americas region, growth was fairly broad-based across both Prestige and Consumer Beauty. 

Asia Pacific

•In 2Q22, Asia Pacific net revenues of $196.2 million, or 12% of Coty sales, increased 17% as reported and 16% LFL. Sales were driven by strong performance in China as well as the continued recovery in Travel Retail.

*As previously disclosed, we have realigned our reportable segments to a principally product category-based structure, comprised of a Prestige business segment and a Consumer Beauty business segment. In addition, we have amended the definition of stock compensation expense for use in certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures. In order to reflect these changes, the Company has recast reported net revenue by segment, reported operating income (loss) by segment, adjusted operating income (loss) by segment and total, adjusted EBITDA by segment, and total adjusted income (loss) before income taxes and total adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations for all comparative periods shown.

Noteworthy Company Developments

Other noteworthy company developments include:

•On November 10, 2021, Coty announced the sale of KKR's remaining 2.4% ownership stake in Coty. This sale further simplifies Coty's capital structure and results in additional annual dividend cash savings of approximately $11 million.

•On November 16, 2021, Coty announced that Dr. Shimei Fan will join the Company as Chief Scientific Officer, beginning on January 3, 2022. From her prior experience, Shimei brings deep and invaluable expertise across three of Coty's strategic growth drivers: color cosmetics, skincare, and the Chinese beauty market.

•On November 17, 2021, Coty released its 2021 Sustainability Report. In the report, Coty shares its progress in advancing the Company's dedicated sustainability strategy, Beauty That lasts, during Coty's FY21.

•On November 18, 2021, Coty announced that it entered into a licensing agreement with Orveda, an ultra-premium skincare brand made in France. The diversity-owned haute-professional skincare combines the best of nature with cutting-edge biotechnology and dermatological benefits to help consumers achieve a healthy skin glow that rivals makeup.

•On November 18, 2021, Coty hosted an Investor Day, where it provided an update on the significant progress made across the Company's six strategic pillars, elaborated on key operational milestones, reported on its comprehensive transformation program, and announced its financial goals through FY25 and beyond.

•On November 30, 2021, Coty completed the issuance of $500 million of 4.750% senior secured notes due in 2029. The proceeds are net leverage neutral and have been used to repay all of the euro-denominated loans outstanding under Coty's existing senior secured "term A" credit facility and a portion of the amount outstanding under its senior secured revolving credit facility due in April 2023. 

•Entering Q3, Wella has completed a refinancing of its existing debt in order to fund a shareholder distribution, which should result in approximately $175 million of cash proceeds to Coty. The Company intends to utilize this distribution plus excess cash on the balance sheet to redeem its 2023 EUR 550M unsecured bonds in full following the time that the bond call premium drops to par on April 15th 2022, thereby accelerating the Company's deleveraging trajectory.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how the underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations (“constant currency”). Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period, with the current period’s results calculated at the prior-year period’s rates. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company discloses the following constant currency financial measures: net revenues, organic like-for-like (LFL) net revenues, adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income.

The Company presents period-over-period comparisons of net revenues on a constant currency basis as well as on an organic (LFL) basis. The Company believes that organic (LFL) better enables management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's net revenues performance from period to period. For the periods described in this release, the term “like-for-like” describes the Company's core operating performance, excluding the financial impact of (i) acquired brands or businesses in the current year period until we have twelve months of comparable financial results, (ii) the divested brands or businesses or early terminated brands, generally, in the prior year non-comparable periods, to maintain comparable financial results with the current fiscal year period and (iii) foreign currency exchange translations to the extent applicable. For a reconciliation of organic (LFL) period-over-period, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Revenues to Like-For-Like Net Revenues”.

The Company presents operating income, operating income margin, gross profit, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin, net revenues, EBITDA, and EPS (diluted) on a non-GAAP basis and specifies that these measures are non-GAAP by using the term “adjusted” (collectively the Adjusted Performance Measures). The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in the beauty industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

Adjusted operating income/Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations excludes restructuring costs and business structure realignment programs, amortization, acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts, stock-based compensation, and asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below. For adjusted EBITDA, in addition to the preceding, we exclude the adjusted depreciation as defined below. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and integrate new acquisitions, and exclude divestitures, and fluctuate based on specific facts and circumstances. Additionally, Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain interest and other (income) expense and deemed preferred stock dividends, as described below, and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive Adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance period-to-period.

Adjusted Performance Measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:

•Costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities: The Company excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and the accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. Additionally, for divestitures, the Company excludes write-offs of assets that are no longer recoverable and contract related costs due to the divestiture. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures, and the maturities of the businesses being acquired or divested. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past transactions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions or divestitures.

11

•Restructuring and other business realignment costs: The Company excludes costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to further evaluate the Company’s ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance.

•Asset impairment charges: The Company excludes the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.

•Amortization expense: We have excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Although we exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.

•Loss/(Gain) on divestitures and Gain on sale of real estate: The Company excludes the impact of Loss/(gain) on divestitures and gain on sale of real estate as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of divestitures and sale of real estate. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.

•Stock-based compensation: Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we have excluded the effect of these expenses from the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA. This is due to their primarily non-cash nature; in addition, the amount and timing of these expenses may be highly variable and unpredictable, which may negatively affect comparability between periods.

•Depreciation and Adjusted depreciation: Our adjusted operating income excludes the impact of accelerated depreciation for certain restructuring projects that affect the expected useful lives of Property, Plant and Equipment, as such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further, we have excluded adjusted depreciation, which represents depreciation expense net of accelerated depreciation charges, from our adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.

•Other (income) expense: We have excluded the write-off of deferred financing fees and discounts that resulted from the pay down of our term debt from the proceeds of the Wella sale, due to the requirements of the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement, as amended. Our management believes these costs do not reflect our underlying ongoing business, and the adjustment of such costs helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period. We have also excluded the impact of pension curtailment (gains) and losses and pension settlements as such events are triggered by our restructuring and other business realignment activities and the amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further, we have excluded the change in fair value of the investment in Wella, as our management believes these unrealized (gains) and losses do not reflect our underlying ongoing business, and the adjustment of such impact helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period. We have excluded the gain on the exchange of Series B Preferred Stock. The transaction was entered into to simplify our capital structure and do not reflect our underlying ongoing business.

•Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant non-controlling interest percentage.

12

•Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. Additionally, adjustments are made for the tax impact of any intra-entity transfer of assets and liabilities.

•Deemed Preferred Stock Dividends: We have excluded preferred stock deemed dividends related to the First Exchange and the Second Exchange from our calculation of adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. These deemed dividends are non-monetary in nature, the transactions were entered into to simplify our capital structure and do not reflect our underlying ongoing business. Management believes that this adjustment helps investors and others compare and analyze our performance from period to period.

The Company has provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to gross profit, adjusted EPS (diluted) to EPS (diluted), and adjusted net revenues to net revenues, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported to Adjusted Results for the Consolidated Statements of Operations.” For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income and adjusted operating income margin to operating income margin, see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating Income” and "Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating Income by Segment." For a reconciliation of adjusted effective tax rate to effective tax rate, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates to Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes and Adjusted Effective Tax Rates.” For a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income margin to net income (loss), see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income.”

The Company also presents free cash flow, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted EBITDA"), immediate liquidity, Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt. Management believes that these measures are useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures; adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income, excluding adjusted depreciation and non-cash stock-based compensation. Net debt or Financial Net Debt (which the Company referred to as "net debt" in prior reporting periods) is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, and Economic Net Debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents less the value of the Wella Stake. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow,” for adjusted EBITDA, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to Adjusted EBITDA” and for Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt, see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Total Debt to Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt.” Further, our immediate liquidity is defined as the sum of available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (please see table "Immediate Liquidity"). 

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

To the extent that the Company provides guidance, it does so only on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, integration and acquisition-related expenses, amortization expenses, non-cash stock-based compensation, adjustments to inventory, and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.

COTY INC. & SUBSIDIARIES 

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Diluted EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plans and the convertible Series B Preferred Stock. When calculating any potential dilutive effect of stock options, Series A Preferred Stock, restricted stock and RSUs we use the treasury method and the if-converted method for the Convertible Series B Preferred Stock. The treasury method typically does not adjust the net income attributable to Coty Inc., while the if-converted method requires an adjustment to reverse the impact of the preferred stock dividends of $68.7 million and $23.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $191.7 million and $43.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on net income applicable to common stockholders during the period.

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATES TO ADJUSTED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The adjusted effective tax rate was 9.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 9.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2020. The differences were primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of income as well as a benefit of $18.8 in the current period recognized on the revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to a tax rate increase enacted in the Netherlands.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)See a description of adjustments under “Adjusted Operating (Loss) Income for Continuing Operations.”

(b)The tax effects of each of the items included in adjusted income are calculated in a manner that results in a corresponding income tax expense/provision for adjusted income. In preparing the calculation, each adjustment to reported income is first analyzed to determine if the adjustment has an income tax consequence. The provision for taxes is then calculated based on the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are incurred, multiplied by the respective statutory rates and offset by the increase or reversal of any valuation allowances commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability.

(c)The amount represents the realized and unrealized gain recognized for the change in the fair value of the investment in Wella.

(d)For the three months ended December 31, 2021, this primarily represents a net gain on the exchange of Series B Preferred Stock closed on October 20, 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, this primarily represents the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the Wella sale.
