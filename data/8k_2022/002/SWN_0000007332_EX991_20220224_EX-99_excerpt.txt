SOUTHWESTERN ENERGY ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2021 RESULTS; PROVIDES 2022 GUIDANCE

Record reserves value underscores resilient and growing free cash flow from responsible natural gas development

SPRING, Texas – February 24, 2022 – Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) (the “Company” or “Southwestern”) today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021 and provided first quarter and full-year 2022 guidance. 

“In 2021, Southwestern Energy delivered results above expectations. We materially increased our scale and enhanced our free cash flow generation capability. Our new Haynesville assets complement our premium Appalachia position by deepening the Company’s inventory, expanding market optionality and reach, including globally through the LNG Corridor, while lowering the risk profile of the enterprise,” said Bill Way, Southwestern Energy President and Chief Executive Officer. 

“We are also reporting Company-record reserves and value that reflect the quality and depth of our inventory. Notably, the reported PV-10 value of these reserves using SEC prices is more than double our current enterprise value, further emphasizing the compelling economic opportunity that SWN offers its shareholders. Our 2022 plan is designed to deliver that value,” continued Way. 

2021 Highlights

•Generated $1.4 billion net cash provided by operating activities, $1.7 billion net cash flow (non-GAAP) and $547 million in free cash flow (non-GAAP);

•Delivered Company-record reserves of 21.1 Tcfe, PV-10 of $18.7 billion, and pre-tax PV-10 (non-GAAP) of $22.4 billion using SEC prices;

•Closed acquisitions of Indigo Natural Resources on September 1st and GEP Haynesville on December 31st; becomes largest Haynesville and second-largest natural gas-focused producer in United States;

•Strengthened financial position and lowered leverage ratio to 2.0 times, expanded liquidity, reduced cost of debt and extended weighted-average debt maturity profile; upgraded to BB+ by S&P in January 2022; and

•Announced and implementing Company-wide responsibly sourced gas certification and continuous monitoring.

2022 Guidance

The 2022 plan is designed to optimize free cash flow through the execution of our strategy of disciplined investment at maintenance capital levels. Highlights are presented below; full guidance is available in the attachments to this press release and on the Company’s website.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Capital investments on the cash flow statement include an increase of $7 million and a decrease of $5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and an increase of $70 million and a decrease of $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, relating to the change in accrued expenditures between periods. 

Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results

For the quarter ended December 31, 2021, Southwestern Energy recorded net income of $2.4 billion, or $2.31 per diluted share, including a positive $2.0 billion non-cash change in unsettled mark to market derivatives. This compares to a net loss of $92 million, or ($0.14) per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Adjusted net income (non-GAAP), which excludes non-cash items noted above and other one-time charges, was $318 million or $0.31 per diluted share in 2021 and $119 million or $0.18 per share for the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily related to increased production volumes and increased commodity prices. For the fourth quarter of 2021, adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $671 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $533 million and net cash flow (non-GAAP) was $633 million, and free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $341 million.

As indicated in the table below, fourth quarter 2021 weighted average realized price, including $0.28 per Mcfe of transportation expenses, was $5.36 per Mcfe, excluding the impact of derivatives. Including derivatives, the weighted average realized price for the quarter was up 31% to $2.81 per Mcfe, as compared to prior year, primarily due to higher commodity prices, including a 119% increase in NYMEX and an 81% increase in WTI, partially offset by the impact of settled derivatives. Fourth quarter 2021 weighted average realized price before transportation expense and excluding derivatives was $5.64 per Mcfe. 

Full Year 2021 Financial Results

The Company recorded a net loss of $25 million, or ($0.03) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a net loss of $3.1 billion, or ($5.42) per share in 2020. In 2021, the Company recorded a $944 million non-cash loss on unsettled derivatives. Excluding these non-cash and other one-time items, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for 2021 was $831 million, or $1.05 per share, compared to $221 million, or $0.38 per share, in 2020. The increase in adjusted net income (non-GAAP) compared to prior year was primarily the result of increased commodity prices and increased production volumes associated with the Company’s acquisitions. In 2021, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $1.8 billion, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion, net cash flow (non-GAAP) was $1.7 billion, and free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $547 million.

As indicated in the table below, for the full year 2021, weighted average realized price, including $0.34 per Mcfe of transportation expense, was $3.74 per Mcfe excluding the impact of derivatives. Including derivatives, weighted average realized price was up 30% from $1.94 per Mcfe in 2020 to $2.53 per Mcfe in 2021. The increase was primarily related to higher commodity prices, including an 85% increase in NYMEX Henry Hub and a 72% increase in WTI, partially offset by the impact of derivatives. In 2021, the weighted average realized price before transportation expenses and excluding the impact of derivatives was $4.08 per Mcfe.

As of December 31, 2021, Southwestern Energy had total debt of $5.4 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of 2.0x. At the end of 2021, the Company had access to $1.4 billion of liquidity, with $460 million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility and $160 million in outstanding letters of credit. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company further extended its maturity profile and improved its weighted average cost of debt when securing financing for the consideration of its GEP Haynesville acquisition

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results, the results of its peers and of prior periods. 

One such non-GAAP financial measure is net cash flow. Management presents this measure because (i) it is accepted as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt, (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the Company may not control and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred.

Another such non-GAAP financial measure is free cash flow, which is defined as cash provided by operating activities, adjusting for changes in operating assets and liabilities, merger-related expenses and restructuring charges, less total capital investments. Management presents this measure because it is accepted as an indicator of excess cash flow available to a company for the repayment of debt or for other general corporate purposes.

Another such non-GAAP financial measure is pre-tax PV-10. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows (“standardized measure”), or after-tax PV-10 amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, PV-10 is based on a pricing methodology and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, PV-10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and securities analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis. The difference between the standardized measure and the PV-10 amount is the discounted amount of estimated future income taxes. 

Additional non-GAAP financial measures the Company may present from time to time are net debt, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA, all which exclude certain charges or amounts. Management presents these measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the Company’s position and performance are measured relative to the position and performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the Company excludes information regarding these types of items. These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
