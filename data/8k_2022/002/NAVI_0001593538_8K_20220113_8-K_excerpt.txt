ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement 

On January 13, 2022, Navient Corporation (the “Company”), and the Company’s subsidiaries Navient Solutions, LLC and Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc., entered into a series of Consent Judgment and Orders (the “Agreements”) with 40 State Attorneys General to resolve all matters in dispute related to the previously disclosed lawsuits filed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the States of Washington, Illinois, California, New Jersey and Mississippi as well as the related investigations, subpoenas, civil investigative demands and inquiries from various other State Attorneys General (collectively, the “Actions”) subject to final court approval. These Agreements do not resolve the previously disclosed litigation involving the Company and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Navient believes strongly that its policies and practices are sound, expressly denies the allegations and expressly denies that it has violated any law or engaged in any action that has harmed borrowers. After years of discovery, no evidence was produced to substantiate these claims. The Company resolved the Actions to avoid the continued burden, expense, time and distraction of state-by-state litigation and investigations.

Navient will cancel loan balances of approximately 66,000 borrowers with qualifying private education loans that were originated largely between 2002 and 2010 and later defaulted and charged off. The majority of these borrowers attended for-profit schools that were closed years after the loans were originated due to actions taken by various state or federal agencies. Navient will notify the affected borrowers and co-borrowers shortly after the Agreements receive final court approvals. The loans to be cancelled have aggregate outstanding balances of approximately $1.7 billion. The pre-tax expense to the Company to cancel these loans is approximately $50 million which represents the amount of expected future recoveries of these charged-off loans on the balance sheet.

In addition, the Company will make a one-time payment of approximately $145 million to the states. A portion of that payment will reimburse the states for their costs with the remaining funds to be used by the states to provide payments to certain student loan borrowers as determined by the states. Navient also has agreed to maintain servicing practices that support borrower success, nearly all matching the company’s long-established practices. 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized regulatory expenses of approximately $170 million on an after-tax basis. Navient estimates that these costs are substantially lower than the expected costs of ongoing state litigation and investigations and historically these matters have represented the vast majority of our regulatory costs. Prior to the fourth quarter, this contingent liability was neither probable nor reasonably estimable and, as a result, no contingent liability had been previously established. The Company anticipates no changes to its previously announced capital return strategy.

The foregoing description of the Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreements, a copy of which will be filed and incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Company’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
