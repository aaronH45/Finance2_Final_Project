Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business Operations

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners and support their needs so they can perform their work flawlessly, whether in the office or at a remote location. 

During the fourth quarter 2021, our business continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the current trajectory of the Omicron variant suggests its impact may be shorter and less severe than previous variants, the Omicron variant continued to negatively impact workplace attendance and post sale revenue in the fourth quarter as compared to prior year. We experienced a modest increase in post sale revenue in fourth quarter 2021, as compared to third quarter 2021, however, the prolonged and extensive impact of the COVID-19 variants continue to cause many of our customers to delay their plans of returning employees to the office. We currently anticipate an increase in workplace attendance and post sale revenue in the second half of 2022. Although we are seeing improvements in overall global supply chain issues created in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as those relating to transportation and logistics, these issues continue to result in unprecedented levels of disruption, causing shortages and transportation delays of both our products and third-party IT hardware. These supply chain disruptions have not materially improved in the fourth quarter of 2021 and we expect they will remain a challenge throughout the first half of 2022. This has resulted in lower than anticipated equipment and IT sales, higher transportation and logistics costs and growth of our order backlog1 at the end of the quarter, as our customers continued to invest in our print technology and services. We expect the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential emergence of new variants, as well as the global supply chain disruption, to delay economic recovery and continue to affect our revenues and margins, with improvements anticipated in the second half of 2022. 

Goodwill Impairment 

Fourth quarter 2021 includes an after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax) or $4.38 per share. This charge largely reflects the fact that Xerox’s print business has been and will continue to be impacted by the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and includes a recognition that some companies will maintain some form of a hybrid workplace indefinitely. This development will continue to have an impact on the print business as compared to pre-pandemic levels. We expect to mitigate some of this impact by offering more digital services and other offerings that are targeted for the hybrid business model. Additionally, the Company is currently pursuing a strategy to develop and expand certain growth businesses such as financing, software and innovation to offset and eventually exceed the reduced cash flows from the print business.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related income tax effects.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth below as well as in the fourth quarter 2021 presentation slides available at www.xerox.com/investor. 

These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted Earnings Measures

•Net (Loss) Income and Earnings per share (EPS) 

•Effective Tax Rate

The above measures were adjusted for the following items:

•Restructuring and related costs, net: Restructuring and related costs, net include restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as costs associated with our transformation programs beyond those normally included in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Restructuring consists of costs primarily related to severance and benefits paid to employees pursuant to formal restructuring and workforce reduction plans. Asset impairment includes costs incurred for those assets sold, abandoned or made obsolete as a result of our restructuring actions, exiting from a business or other strategic business changes. Additional costs for our transformation programs are primarily related to the implementation of strategic actions and initiatives and include third-party professional service costs as well as one-time incremental costs. All of these costs can vary significantly in terms of amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of the business. Accordingly, due to that significant variability, we will exclude these charges since we do not believe they provide meaningful insight into our current or past operating performance nor do we believe they are reflective of our expected future operating expenses as such charges are expected to yield future benefits and savings with respect to our operational performance. 

•Amortization of intangible assets: The amortization of intangible assets is driven by our acquisition activity which can vary in size, nature and timing as compared to other companies within our industry and from period to period. The use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.

•Transaction and related costs, net: Transaction and related costs, net are costs and expenses primarily associated with certain strategic M&A projects. These costs are primarily for third-party legal, accounting, consulting and other similar type professional services as well as potential legal settlements that may arise in connection with those M&A transactions. These costs are considered incremental to our normal operating charges and were incurred or are expected to be incurred solely as a result of the planned transactions. Accordingly, we are excluding these expenses from our Adjusted Earnings Measures in order to evaluate our performance on a comparable basis. 

•Non-service retirement-related costs: Our defined benefit pension and retiree health costs include several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by changes in the debt and equity markets as well as those that are predominantly legacy in nature and related to employees who are no longer providing current service to the Company (e.g. retirees and ex-employees). These elements include (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains/losses and (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments. Accordingly, we consider these elements of our periodic retirement plan costs to be outside the operational performance of the business or legacy costs and not necessarily indicative of current or future cash flow requirements. This approach is consistent with the classification of these costs as non-operating in Other expenses, net. Adjusted earnings will continue to include the service cost elements of our retirement costs, which is related to current employee service as well as the cost of our defined contribution plans.

13

•Other discrete, unusual or infrequent items: We excluded the following items given their discrete, unusual or infrequent nature and their impact on our results for the period:

◦Non-cash goodwill impairment charge

◦Loss on early extinguishment of debt

◦Contract termination costs - IT services.

We believe the exclusion of these items allows investors to better understand and analyze the results for the period as compared to prior periods and expected future trends in our business. 

Adjusted Operating Income and Margin

We calculate and utilize adjusted operating income and margin measures by adjusting our reported pre-tax (loss) income and margin amounts. In addition to the costs and expenses noted as adjustments for our adjusted earnings measures, adjusted operating income and margin also exclude the remaining amounts included in Other expenses, net, which are primarily non-financing interest expense and certain other non-operating costs and expenses. We exclude these amounts in order to evaluate our current and past operating performance and to better understand the expected future trends in our business.

Constant Currency

To better understand trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to adjust revenue to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to this adjusted revenue as “constant currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates. 

Free Cash Flow

To better understand trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to adjust operating cash flows by subtracting amounts related to capital expenditures. Management believes this measure gives investors an additional perspective on cash flow from operating activities in excess of amounts required for reinvestment. It provides a measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, dividends and share repurchase. 

Summary

Management believes that all of these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current period’s results against the corresponding prior period’s results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth on the following tables:
