Announces Reinstatement of Quarterly Dividend 

BETHESDA, MD; February 16, 2022 – Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: HST) (the “Company”), the nation’s largest lodging real estate investment trust (“REIT”), today announced results for fourth quarter and full year 2021.

(unaudited, in millions, except per share and hotel statistics) [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

* Additional detail on the Company’s results, including data for 22 domestic markets and top 40 hotels by Total RevPAR, is available in the Fourth Quarter 2021 Supplemental Financial Information available on the Company’s website at www.hosthotels.com.  

James F. Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We finished 2021 on a high note as we continued to see strong sequential operating improvements across our portfolio. During the fourth quarter, RevPAR was approximately $148, representing a 13% increase over the prior quarter. While the newest variant created additional uncertainty for the lodging industry, it did not dampen the recovery, which continues to be concentrated in Sunbelt markets, particularly at our resorts. Our urban markets also saw strong sequential improvements, driven by business transient customers, where room nights improved over last quarter relative to 2019.”

Risoleo continued, “During the quarter, we completed two additional acquisitions, buying The Alida, Savannah and the Hotel Van Zandt in Austin, bringing the total value of our acquisitions for 2021 to $1.6 billion. In addition, during the quarter and subsequent to year end, we disposed of seven hotels for nearly $1 billion. We also acquired a 49% interest in the established asset management platform of Noble Investment Group through a joint venture with Noble in January. We view the investment as a new opportunity to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio by allowing for investment in select service hotels, extended stay hotels, and new development deals. We remain optimistic about the future of travel and we are focused on continuing to improve the quality, revenue, and profitability metrics of our iconic and irreplaceable portfolio."  

2021 Highlights: 

•

Achieved sequential improvement in RevPAR each quarter of 2021, from $68.04 in the first quarter to $148.46 in the fourth quarter. Improvements were primarily driven by leisure travel in Sunbelt markets with urban hotels showing sequential improvements in the second half of the year.

Fourth Quarter 2021 Revenue Performance  

•

All Owned Hotel Pro Forma RevPAR improved 13% compared to the third quarter of 2021, with average room rates exceeding fourth quarter 2019 rates. While strong leisure demand for resorts and hotels located in the Company’s Sunbelt markets and Hawaii continued to drive the sequential improvement, RevPAR at the Company's downtown and non-resort hotels also saw improvement in the fourth quarter. 

•

Food and beverage pro forma revenues improved approximately $82 million, or 44%, compared to the third quarter of 2021, fueled by continued improvement in Banquet and Catering revenues, which increased 84% over the prior quarter, following the doubling of Banquet and Catering revenues from the second quarter to the third quarter. Throughout the pandemic, food and beverage revenues mostly has been driven by restaurants and other outlet revenue. 

Fourth Quarter 2021 Hotel Operating Expense Performance  

•

Portfolio-wide pro forma hotel operating costs were approximately 24% lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, with a 25% decrease in total revenues compared to fourth quarter of 2019, and costs were only 15% higher compared to the third quarter of 2021, despite an approximately 20% increase in total revenues quarter over quarter. 

o

Staffing challenges began to ease in the fourth quarter and the Company expects hotel operating costs to increase more in line with total revenues over time as hotels continue to transition from their contingency level operational plans to increased staffing levels and controllable spending. 

o

Re-introduction of marketing, maintenance and other support costs is expected to increase other departmental and support expenses as the recovery gains momentum. 

Hotel Business Mix Update  

The Company’s customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business, which accounted for approximately 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, of its 2019 room sales. 

During the fourth quarter, demand continued to be primarily driven by leisure at drive-to and resort destinations. The following are the sequential results of the Company’s consolidated portfolio, including all owned hotels at December 31, 2021 on a pro forma basis, for transient, group and contract business in comparison to 2019 performance: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Capital Allocation Strategy 

The Company continued to execute on its capital allocation strategy by recycling capital into assets that the Company believes will improve the quality and EBITDA growth profile of its portfolio. During the quarter, the Company acquired the 173-room Alida, Savannah, part of the Marriott Tribute Portfolio, for $103 million and the 319-room Hotel Van Zandt in Austin, managed by Kimpton Hotels, for a purchase price of $246 million, including its $4 million FF&E reserve and the assumption of a $102 million non-recourse mortgage. In 2021, the Company acquired seven hotels and two golf courses for a total purchase price of $1.6 billion. 

Additionally during the quarter, the Company sold the W Hollywood for approximately $197 million, including $3 million for the FF&E replacement funds, and a five-hotel portfolio consisting of the Westfields Marriott Washington Dulles, San Ramon Marriott, The Westin Buckhead Atlanta, The Westin Los Angeles Airport and The Whitley for $551 million, including approximately $11 million for the FF&E replacement funds. 

Subsequent to year end, the Company sold the Sheraton Boston for $233 million, including a $163 million bridge loan provided by the Company to the buyer, and expects to record a gain of $12 million in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally, the Company acquired a 49% ownership interest in a joint venture with Noble Investment Group, a private hospitality asset

manager with a focus on upscale select-service and extended stay properties. The agreement provides for the opportunity to acquire interests in future funds and represents a new platform for potential growth. 

Capital Expenditures  

The following presents the Company’s 2021 capital expenditures spend and the forecast for 2022 (in millions): 

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company continues to invest heavily in capital expenditures in the early phases of recovery in order to minimize future disruption and believes these renovations will position these hotels to capture additional revenue during the economic recovery. As of year-end 2021, the Company has completed approximately 85% of the Marriott Transformational Capital Program. The Company received $14 million of operating profit guarantees in 2021, with $2 million received in the fourth quarter, and expects to receive approximately $11 million in operating profit guarantees in 2022 under the Marriott Transformational Capital Program. The program is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2022 and the Company also plans to commence the next phase of an estimated $128 million extensive repositioning at the Fairmont Kea Lani in 2022. 

2022 Outlook  

Given the global economic uncertainty COVID-19 has created for the travel, airline, lodging and tourism and event industries, the Company cannot provide guidance for its operations or fully estimate the effect of COVID-19 or its variants on its operations.  

January 2022 operations declined compared to the fourth quarter results as operations were negatively affected by the increase in COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant. However, trends thus far in February would indicate a return to the positive trajectory of the recovery experienced in the second half of 2021. The Company believes that continued recovery within the lodging industry will be driven by the strength of the economy, increased consumer confidence that the risks associated with travelling and contracting COVID-19 have been significantly reduced, and the return of business and group customers.  

While the Company is not providing guidance on operations at this time, it estimates that for full year 2022, interest expense and corporate and other expenses will be in the following ranges (in millions): [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company does not intend to provide further guidance updates unless deemed appropriate.

To facilitate a quarter-to-quarter comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics and operating results for the periods included in this presentation on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we temporarily are suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated properties owned as of December 31, 2021 but do not include the results of operations for properties sold through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions as of December 31, 2021 are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. See the Notes to Financial Information – All Owned Hotel Pro Forma Operating Statistics and Results for further information on these pro forma statistics. The AC Hotel Scottsdale North is a new development hotel that opened in January 2021 and The Laura Hotel in Houston re-opened under new management in November 2021. Therefore, no adjustments were made for results of these hotels for periods prior to their openings. Results for the hotel sold subsequent to quarter end are included, as it was owned for the entirety of the periods presented. CBD of a location refers to the central business district.

Hotel RevPAR is calculated as room revenues divided by the available room nights. Hotel Total RevPAR is calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other revenues by the available room nights.

Notes to Financial Information 

All Owned Hotel Pro Forma Operating Statistics and Results 

To facilitate a quarter-to-quarter comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in this presentation on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance (discussed in “Hotel Property Level Operating Results” below). However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we temporarily are suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2021, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions as of December 31, 2021 are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore, hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), (ii) EBITDA, (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre, and (iv) All Owned Hotel Pro Forma Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.  

NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share  

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted NAREIT’s definition of FFO included in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis. 

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share  

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:  

•

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.  

•

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.  

•

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.  

•

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. 

In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our on-going operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.  

EBITDA  

Earnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.  

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre  

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. 

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain

Notes to Financial Information 

credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre: 

•

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.  

•

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.  

•

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.  

•

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. 

In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim. 

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share, Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre  

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre, which are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only), severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.  

Similarly, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by outside partners, and a 15% interest held by outside partners in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.  

Hotel Property Level Operating Results 

We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a hotel-level pro forma basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our hotel results reflect the operating

HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. 

Notes to Financial Information 

results of our hotels as discussed in “All Owned Hotel Pro Forma Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present all owned hotel pro forma EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. All owned hotel pro forma results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.  

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.  

While management believes that presentation of all owned hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on all owned hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe all owned hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.
