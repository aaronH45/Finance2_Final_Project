Fourth Quarter 2021 Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings per diluted share was a record $6.15, up 36 percent from the prior year reflecting strong business growth. Full year adjusted operating earnings per diluted share excluding unlocking increased 35 percent to $22.75.Perspective from Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

“Ameriprise delivered another very strong quarter and a record year for client flows, assets and financial results. 

“This significant organic growth was complemented by strategic actions, including our acquisition of BMO EMEA. In the quarter, we drove more than $40 billion in client net inflows. 

“Wealth and Asset Management generated 80% of our 2021 adjusted operating earnings, and we continued to deliver consistently strong results in our high-quality insurance and annuity business. This allows us to generate a differentiated level of capital return to shareholders, while investing in the business and maintaining our balance sheet discipline. 

“Ameriprise is well positioned to continue navigating the current environment successfully, and rising interest rates would be another positive. We remain focused on serving our clients well and are energized about the opportunity before us.”

•Fourth quarter GAAP net income per diluted share was $5.96, versus $1.43 a year ago, from strong business performance and lower market impact on derivatives, with BMO integration costs in the current year period. Full year GAAP net income per diluted share increased 89 percent to $23.00.

•Assets under management and administration increased to a record high of $1.4 trillion. BMO’s EMEA Asset Management business (BMO EMEA) added $136 billion of acquired assets.

•Net flows from Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management were over $40 billion, including a net $15 billion of BMO-related flows primarily from the U.S. asset transfers in North America mainly in December.

•Adjusted operating net revenue was $3.7 billion, an 18 percent increase from strong organic growth. 

•Ameriprise generated strong profitability with pretax adjusted operating earnings up 33 percent to $894 million, driven by 45 percent earnings growth from Wealth and Asset Management. These businesses represented 81 percent of operating earnings in the quarter.

•Investment performance at Columbia Threadneedle Investments remains excellent with 133 funds with 4- and 5-star Morningstar ratings with more than 80% of funds above median on an asset-weighted basis over 3-, 5- and 10-year time periods.

•The company returned $630 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter for a total of $2.4 billion for the full year, which was nearly 90 percent of adjusted operating earnings.

•The company announced a new share repurchase authorization of $3.0 billion through March 31, 2024.

•On November 8, 2021, the company successfully closed the acquisition of BMO EMEA and recognized $18 million of integration expense on a GAAP basis in the quarter.

Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP results were modestly impacted by the market changes that negatively affected credit spreads and the valuation of derivatives, as well as integration costs from the acquisition of BMO EMEA. The prior year quarter also included significant negative impacts from market changes that affected credit spreads and valuation of derivatives.

Advice & Wealth Management pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 34 percent to a record $472 million driven by robust client net flows, higher transactional activity, market appreciation, increased bank profitability and disciplined expense management. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 22.3 percent, up 250 basis points, which demonstrated our strategic focus on profitable growth.

Adjusted operating net revenues grew 19 percent to $2.1 billion, reflecting strong client net flows and transactional activity levels, as well as market appreciation. 

Distribution expenses were up 20 percent associated with robust organic growth. General and administrative expense increased 2 percent, as higher activity-based expense and performance-based compensation were partially offset by expense discipline.

Total client assets grew 17 percent to $858 billion. Substantial organic growth across our advisor network was driven primarily by increased new client acquisition, deeper client relationships from existing clients, as well as experienced advisor recruiting. Total client flows reached a new high of $12.5 billion in the quarter, with a 17 percent increase in wrap flows and an 8 percent increase in transactional activity. Wrap net flows were $10.5 billion, representing the fifth consecutive quarter at or above $9.0 billion. Cash balances increased to $43.8 billion with an opportunity for clients to put cash back to work in the future.

Adjusted operating net revenue per advisor on a trailing 12-month basis was $796,000. Excluding the decline in short-term interest rates, adjusted operating net revenue per advisor increased 20 percent. Total advisors increased 2 percent to 10,116, with excellent advisor retention, as well as the addition of 86 experienced advisors in the quarter.

Adjusted operating revenues grew to $1.1 billion, up 33 percent from strong performance fees, the addition of the recently acquired EMEA Asset Management business from BMO, the cumulative benefit of inflows, as well as higher equity markets. Excluding BMO EMEA, revenue increased 25 percent. 

Distribution expense increased 16 percent from strong equity market appreciation. General and administrative expense grew 27 percent driven by the BMO EMEA acquisition and higher performance fee compensation. Excluding BMO EMEA, G&A was well managed and up 12 percent.

In the quarter, net inflows were $27.5 billion, which included a net $15.0 billion related to BMO. In the U.S., $16.9 billion of inflows were related to clients that elected to transfer retail and institutional assets to us resulting from the transition of investment advisory services as part of an arrangement with BMO. BMO EMEA had $1.9 billion of outflows, of which approximately 40 percent was associated with the acquisition.

•Retail net inflows were $13.6 billion, which included reinvested dividends, $2.6 billion of BMO-related net inflows in the U.S. and EMEA, and $2.4 billion of underlying outflows.

Retirement & Protection Solutions pretax adjusted operating earnings were $183 million as market appreciation was largely offset by higher sales expense, net outflows in retirement products and lower portfolio yields. Overall claims remain within expected ranges.

The company continues its ongoing shift to lower-risk products. In December, the company announced that it discontinued sales of substantially all variable annuities with living benefit riders at year end, with a full exit of new sales by mid-2022. In addition, the company discontinued sales of universal life with secondary guarantees and universal life/LTC combo products in the quarter.

Retirement & Protection Solutions sales increased to $1.6 billion. Variable annuity sales increased 15 percent to $1.5 billion, with 67 percent of sales in products without living benefit guarantees. Protection sales increased 41 percent to $97 million, reflecting a significant shift of sales to higher-margin accumulation VUL products.

These non-GAAP financial measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measure reconciliations can be found on the subsequent pages.
