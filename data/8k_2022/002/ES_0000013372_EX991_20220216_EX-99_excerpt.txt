Exhibit 99.1 

Eversource Energy Reports Full-Year Results 

(HARTFORD, Conn. and BOSTON, Mass. – February 16, 2022) Eversource Energy (NYSE: ES) today reported full-year 2021 earnings of $1,220.5 million, or $3.54 per share, compared with earnings of $1,205.2 million, or $3.55 per share, for full-year 2020. Eversource also reported fourth quarter 2021 earnings of $306.7 million, or $0.89 per share, compared with fourth quarter 2020 earnings of $271.9 million, or $0.79 per share. 

Results for both years include acquisition-related charges primarily related to the October 2020 acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. Those after-tax charges totaled $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $23.6 million for all of 2021, compared with charges of $19.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $32.1 million for all of 2020. 

Additionally, full-year 2021 results include after-tax charges related to the settlement agreement concerning Eversource’s subsidiary, The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P). Those after-tax charges totaled $86.1 million for full-year 2021. Excluding the acquisition and settlement charges noted above, Eversource earned $1,330.2 million1, or $3.86 per share1, for the full-year 2021 and $313.3 million1, or $0.91 per share1 in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with earnings of $1,237.3 million1, or $3.64 per share1, for the full-year 2020, and $291.2 million1, or $0.85 per share1, in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Also today, Eversource Energy projected 2022 earnings of between $4.00 per share and $4.17 per share. That range excludes remaining acquisition-related costs. The company also projected that its compound annual earnings per share growth from its regulated businesses would be in the upper half of a range of 5-7 percent through 2026, using the adjusted $3.86 per share it earned in 2021 as the base level. 

“Our 9,200 employees operated our businesses extremely well in 2021,” said Joe Nolan, Eversource president and chief executive officer. “Our electric service reliability performance was in the top decile among our electric industry peers, and we remained a leader in safety, sustainability and emergency response. Moreover, we are at the forefront of implementing our region’s clean energy goals, commencing work on our first offshore wind project, supporting the nation’s best energy efficiency programs, and continuing to drive down our greenhouse gas footprint toward our goal of having our operations be carbon neutral by 2030.” 

Electric Transmission 

Eversource Energy’s transmission segment earned $544.6 million in 2021, compared with earnings of $502.5 million in 2020. Transmission earnings were $132.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with earnings of $120.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Transmission segment results improved due to a higher level of investment in Eversource’s electric transmission system. 

Electric Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s electric distribution segment, excluding the CL&P charges noted above, earned $556.2 million1 in 2021, compared with $544 million in 2020. Electric distribution earned $105 million1 in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with earnings of $93.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Improved full year results were due primarily to higher revenues, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance (O&M) expense, depreciation, property taxes and interest expense. Improved fourth quarter results were due primarily to lower O&M expense. 

Natural Gas Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s natural gas distribution segment earned $204.8 million in 2021, compared with earnings of $135.6 million1  in 2020. It earned $75.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with earnings of $62.3 million1 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Improved results for the full year and the fourth quarter were due primarily to the addition of the former Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets, most of which are now held by Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts. 

Water Distribution 

Eversource’s water distribution segment earned $36.8 million in 2021, compared with earnings of $41.2 million in 2020. The water segment earned $6.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with earnings of $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Lower full year results were primarily due to the absence of a gain from the sale of the water system around Hingham, Massachusetts in 2020. Higher fourth quarter results were due primarily to a gain on a land sale. 

Eversource Parent and Other Companies 

Eversource Energy parent and other companies, excluding the acquisition and transition-related costs noted above, lost $12.2 million1 in 2021, compared with earnings of $14 million1 in 2020. It lost $5.9 million1  in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with earnings of $9.2 million1 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Lower results for both the full-year and fourth quarter primarily reflect a higher effective tax rate at the parent segment.

1 All per-share amounts in this news release are reported on a diluted basis. The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource Energy. The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities of such business, but rather represent a direct interest in Eversource Energy's assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a financial measure not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to common shareholders of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource Energy common shares outstanding for the period. Earnings discussions also include non-GAAP financial measures referencing 2021 earnings and EPS excluding charges at CL&P related to a settlement agreement that included credits to customers and funding of various customer assistance initiatives and a storm performance penalty imposed on CL&P by PURA and 2021 and 2020 earnings and EPS excluding certain acquisition and transition costs. Eversource Energy uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results by business and to more fully compare and explain 2021 and 2020 results without including these items. This information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance and planning and forecasting of future periods. Management believes the impacts of the CL&P settlement agreement, the storm performance penalty imposed on CL&P by PURA, and acquisition and transition costs are not indicative of Eversource Energy’s ongoing costs and performance. Management views these charges as not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business and therefore not an indicator of baseline operating performance. Due to the nature and significance of the effect of these items on net income attributable to common shareholders and EPS, management believes that the non-GAAP presentation is a more meaningful representation of Eversource Energy’s financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers in analyzing historical and future performance of the business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to Eversource Energy’s consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of Eversource Energy’s operating performance.
