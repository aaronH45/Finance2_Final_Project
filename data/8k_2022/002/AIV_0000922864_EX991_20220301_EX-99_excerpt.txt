Aimco Announces Fourth Quarter Earnings 

Denver, Colorado, March 1, 2022 – Apartment Investment and Management Company (“Aimco”) (NYSE: AIV) announced today fourth quarter results for 2021. 

Wes Powell, Aimco President and Chief Executive Officer, comments: “Aimco had a successful 2021 and 2022 is off to a good start. Consumer and investor demand for multifamily housing remains remarkably strong, and Aimco is well positioned given the performance of our current class of development projects, the composition of our stabilized apartment portfolio and our growing pipeline of high-quality investment opportunities. All the while, we remain focused on maintaining ample liquidity, pre-funding our construction activities and utilizing financial leverage prudently. I offer my thanks to our teammates across the country for their excellent work and dedication to our mission of adding value for Aimco shareholders.” 

Lynn Stanfield, Aimco Chief Financial Officer, adds: “Aimco’s balance sheet remains strong and liquid as we add opportunities to our pipeline. In the fourth quarter, we closed on a $52 million preferred equity financing to aid in funding the development of Upton Place, improving Aimco’s expected return on invested capital and affording Aimco the opportunity to allocate capital to additional investments. Our portfolio of stabilized properties produced cash flow sufficient to cover core overhead costs and finished 2021 with fourth quarter revenue growth of 9.7% and Net Operating Income (“NOI”) growth of 16.8%. In addition, we recently repurchased shares at a substantial discount to Aimco Net Asset Value (“NAV”).”  

Financial Results and Recent Highlights 

•  

Net loss attributable to common stockholders per share, on a dilutive basis, was $(0.01) for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, compared to net loss per share of $(0.10) for the same period in 2020, due primarily to the 2020 impairments related to certain corporate assets received in conjunction with the separation from Apartment Income REIT Corporation (“AIR Communities”). 

•  

Aimco Total Shareholder Return was 46.2% for the year of 2021.  

•  

Strong demand for Aimco’s Development and Redevelopment projects resulted in the execution of approximately 140 net new leases during the fourth quarter, with the majority secured for units that were still under construction. The new leases were signed at rental rates ahead of target, and contributed to the $4.5 million in revenue from these properties during the period, up more than 40% from the third quarter.  

•  

In the fourth quarter 2021, Aimco closed a $52 million preferred equity financing to fund the completion of construction activities at Upton Place and allow Aimco to allocate capital to additional value-add investments.  

•  

Aimco ended the fourth quarter with $395 million of liquidity, including cash and capacity on its revolving credit facility. 

•  

Fourth Quarter 2021 Revenue and NOI from Aimco’s Stabilized Operating Properties was up 9.7% and 16.8%, respectively, year-over-year, with occupancy of 98.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year.  

•  

Full Year 2021 Revenue and NOI from Aimco’s Stabilized Operating Properties was up 4.1% and 4.1%, respectively, year-over-year, with occupancy of 97.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. 

•  

In early 2022, Aimco repurchased 202,400 shares of Aimco Class A Common Stock at a weighted average price of $6.49.

Value Add, Opportunistic & Alternative Investments: 

Development and Redevelopment 

Aimco generally seeks development and redevelopment opportunities where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined, and where Aimco has a comparative advantage over others in the market. Aimco’s Value Add and Opportunistic investments may also target portfolio acquisitions, operational turnarounds, and re-entitlements. 

In the fourth quarter, Aimco had eight active development and redevelopment projects located in five different markets across the United States. These projects remain on track, as evidenced by project-level budget and schedule, lease-up metrics, and current market valuations. By the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Aimco had achieved stabilized occupancy at two of the four initial leased properties from AIR Communities. Across its eight active projects, Aimco invested approximately $215 million during 2021, and expects to invest another $330 million to complete these projects.  

•  

At the North Tower of Flamingo Point in Miami Beach, Florida, at year end, Aimco had completed construction on more than half of the units with the remaining units on track to be delivered in early March, on schedule. Demand for these highly tailored apartment homes has been strong. The property was 95% pre-leased as of February 25, 2022, and we now forecast to reach stabilized occupancy six months ahead of plan and at rental rates approximately 25% ahead of underwriting. 

•  

Prism in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and 707 Leahy in Redwood City, California, reached stabilized occupancy by year end 2021, and The Fremont on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado is expected to reach stabilized occupancy in the third quarter of 2022. Aimco plans to monetize its investment in accordance with the terms of the lease agreements with AIR Communities. 

•  

Construction continues on schedule and on budget at The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club in Aurora, Colorado, The Hamilton in Miami, Florida and Oak Shore in Corte Madera, California.  

Alternative Investments 

Aimco uses alternative investment strategies when it has special knowledge or expertise relevant to the venture and when opportunity exists for positive asymmetric outcomes. Aimco’s current investments include a mezzanine loan with an option to participate in future development and three passive equity investments. 

•  

In 2021, operations at Parkmerced were stressed due to reduced in-person learning at the neighboring San Francisco State University and lower demand as the region navigated the pandemic and related restrictions. Through this, the borrower on Aimco’s $338 million mezzanine loan has performed, including by advancing capital to service its first mortgage debt, and has reported that it expects to do the same in 2022.  

•  

In the fourth quarter, Aimco funded a capital call of $11.2 million associated with the previously announced $50 million total passive equity commitment to the life sciences developer, IQHQ, bringing our total investment to $35.8 million. In early 2022, Aimco funded the remaining balance on the commitment to IQHQ. 

Investment Activity 

Aimco expects to have a broad set of investment opportunities, including, but not limited to, development, redevelopment, portfolio acquisitions, programmatic joint ventures, debt placements, operational turnarounds, and re-entitlements.

•  

Expense in the fourth quarter was $10.1 million, down 5.0% year-over-year, due primarily to non-recurring adjustments in real estate taxes and insurance. 

•  

1001 Brickell Bay Drive, a waterfront office building in Miami, Florida, is owned as part of a larger assemblage containing substantial excess development rights. At the end of the fourth quarter, the building was 80% occupied, up 700 basis points from the end of the third quarter.  

Balance Sheet and Financing Activity

Equity Capital Activities 

Subsequent to quarter end, in January, Aimco repurchased 202,400 shares of Aimco Class A Common Stock at a weighted average price of $6.49, at a significant discount to our internally estimated NAV and at an attractive expected risk-adjusted return compared to alternate uses of Aimco capital. 

Dividend

2022 Plans and Goals:  

Aimco’s 2022 plan is an extension of its work in 2021 and supportive of its long-term growth strategy. Aimco intends to continue to focus on actively managing its development, redevelopment, and lease-up projects; growing its pipeline of accretive real estate investments; and maintaining a sizeable allocation to stabilized operating properties as needed to balance Aimco’s risk profile and provide stable cash flow.  

Opportunistic and Value Add Investments 

In 2022, Aimco plans to:  

•  

Complete the construction of Flamingo Point’s North Tower in Miami Beach, Florida and reach stabilized occupancy six months ahead of plan. The building is 95% leased as of February 25, 2022, with average monthly rental rates more than $900 ahead of target; 

•  

Reach stabilized occupancy at The Fremont on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado (85% leased as of February 25, 2022) and monetize its investments in 707 Leahy in Redwood City, California and Prism in Cambridge, Massachusetts under the terms of the Master Leasing Agreement with AIR Communities;  

•  

Begin the phased delivery of fully renovated waterfront apartment homes and commence the lease-up of Hamilton on the Bay in Miami, Florida. Average rental rates in the submarket have increased more than 20% since Aimco acquired the property in Q3 of 2020; and

Progress the development of Upton Place in Washington, DC, The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Colorado, and Oak Shore in Corte Madera, California, which are currently on time and on budget.

Additionally, Aimco plans to grow its investment pipeline by sourcing value-add opportunities from within its existing portfolio, through strategic partnerships, and local contacts. Aimco teams are in active discussions and negotiations on prospective opportunities across the country, including: 

•  

A 9-acre development site (now under contract) located in a high-growth South Florida submarket that could accommodate nearly 1,500 units (or 3 million GSF) at full build out, for a price of approximately $100 million;  

•  

Joint venture development opportunities in South Florida, San Diego, and Washington, DC submarkets that together could accommodate as many as 2,700 units (or 3 million GSF) at full build out;  

•  

The lease of a property located in Manhattan’s Upper East Side neighborhood from AIR Communities to develop 41 luxury apartment homes; and 

•  

The acquisition of just over two acres of land contiguous to an existing Aimco property located in Chicago’s western suburbs. 

Stabilized Operating Portfolio 

Aimco forecasts to build upon solid 2021 operating results and maintain sufficient cash flow to cover all core overhead. 

Financing Activity 

In 2022, Aimco plans to remain pre-funded for all investment commitments by utilizing its broad range of available financing options and eliminating the need to issue additional public market equity. Aimco has no debt maturing in 2022 and will start preparations for 2023 and 2024 debt maturities.

Glossary and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial and Operating Measures 

This Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial and operating measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Aimco’s definitions and calculations of these Non-GAAP financial and operating measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These Non-GAAP financial and operating measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance and should not be considered an alternative measure of liquidity. 

AIMCO OP: AIMCO OP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, is the operating partnership in Aimco’s UPREIT structure. Aimco owns approximately 93.1% of the legal interest in the common partnership units of the Aimco OP and 95.0% of the economic interest in the common partnership units of the Aimco OP. 

AVERAGE REVENUE PER APARTMENT HOME: Represents Aimco average monthly rental and other property revenues, excluding utility cost reimbursements, divided by the number of occupied apartment homes as of the end of the period. 

DIRECT CAPITAL INVESTMENT: Represents all items related to the planning, construction, and management of development and redevelopment projects paid to third party providers. Direct Capital Investment does not include real estate taxes, insurance, right of use lease payments, and certain costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP, such as financing costs and internal team time.  

EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION FOR REAL ESTATE (“EBITDAre”): Nareit defines EBITDAre as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, further adjusted for: 

•   

gains and losses on the dispositions of depreciated property; 

•   

impairment write-downs of depreciated property; 

•   

impairment write-downs of investments in unconsolidated partnerships caused by a decrease in the value of the depreciated property in such partnerships; and 

•   

adjustments to reflect the Aimco’s share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities. 

Aimco believes that EBITDAre is useful to investors, creditors and rating agencies as a supplemental measure of Aimco’s ability to incur and service debt because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and facilitates comparison of credit strength between Aimco and other companies. 

Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Release and Supplemental Schedules | 19 

ADJUSTED EBITDAre: Adjusted EBITDAre is defined by Aimco as EBITDAre adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items for the reasons set forth below: 

•   

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships, EBITDAre adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests, and the amount of unrealized gains recognized by Aimco on its interest rate options, to allow investors to compare a measure of Aimco’s earnings before the effects of Aimco’s capital structure and indebtedness with that of other companies in the real estate industry; 

•   

the amount of interest income recognized by Aimco related to the mezzanine loan made by Aimco to a partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments that was accrued but not paid during the quarter. 

FREE CASH FLOW: Free Cash Flow, as calculated for Aimco’s retained portfolio, represents an apartment community’s property net operating income, less spending for Capital Replacements. Capital Replacement spending is a measure of the cost of capital asset used during the period. Aimco believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of apartment community performance because it takes into consideration costs incurred during the period to replace capital assets that have been consumed during Aimco’s ownership. 

MEZZANINE INVESTMENTS: Aimco’s Mezzanine Investments includes the $275 million mezzanine loan, and associated accrued interest, made by Aimco to a partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments, located in southwest San Francisco. For more information regarding this investment see Aimco’s SEC Form 10-K filed for the period ended December 31, 2021. 

NET ASSET VALUE: Net Asset Value is calculated as the market value of a company's assets less its liabilities and obligations. Aimco estimates the value of its portfolio using methods management believes to be appropriate based on the characteristics of the item being valued.  

NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI) MARGIN: Represents an apartment community’s net operating income as a percentage of the apartment community’s rental and other property revenues. 

OTHER EXPENSES, NET: Other expenses, net, generally consists of risk management activities related to Aimco’s unconsolidated partnerships and certain other corporate expenses. 

PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI): NOI is defined by Aimco as total property rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes. NOI does not include: property management revenues, primarily from affiliates; casualties; property management expenses; depreciation; or interest expense. NOI is helpful because it helps both investors and management to understand the operating performance of real estate excluding costs associated with decisions about acquisition pricing, overhead allocations, and financing arrangements. NOI is also considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of real estate. Reconciliations of NOI as presented in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information to Aimco’s consolidated GAAP amounts are provided below. 

Due to the diversity of its economic ownership interests in its apartment communities in the periods presented, Aimco evaluates the performance of the apartment communities in its segments using Property NOI, which represents the NOI for the apartment communities that Aimco consolidates and excludes apartment communities that it does not consolidate. Property NOI is defined as rental and other property revenue less property operating expenses. In its evaluation of community results, Aimco excludes utility cost reimbursement from rental and other property revenues and reflects such amount as a reduction of the related utility expense within property operating expenses. The following table presents the reconciliation of GAAP rental and other property revenue to the revenues before utility reimbursements and GAAP property operating expenses to expenses, net of utility reimbursements as presented on Supplemental Schedule 6.
