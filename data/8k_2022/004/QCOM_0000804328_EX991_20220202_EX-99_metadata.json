        "(2) At fiscal year end, the quarterly tax provision for each column equals the annual tax provision (benefit) for each column computed in accordance with GAAP. In interim quarters, the sum of these provisions (benefits) may not equal the total GAAP tax provision, and this difference is included in the tax provision (benefit) in the “Other Items” column. Tax expense in the “Other Items” column included a $26 million charge related to a foreign tax audit and a $12 million foreign currency loss related to a noncurrent receivable resulting from our refund claim of Korean withholding taxes paid in prior periods, partially offset by a $9 million benefit to reconcile the tax provision of each column to the total GAAP tax provision for the quarter, a $5 million benefit for the tax effect of acquisition-related charges and a $1 million benefit from the combined effect of other items in EBT."
