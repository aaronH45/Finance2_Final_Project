 Item 8.01  Other Events.    

On December 10, 2021, the Board of Directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”) approved, and on February 8, 2022 BMS entered into, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) transactions under agreements with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Citibank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (each, an “ASR Agreement” and collectively, the “ASR Agreements”) to repurchase an aggregate $5.0 billion (the “Repurchase Price”) of BMS common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the “Common Stock”). 

Under the terms of the ASR Agreements, on February 9, 2022, BMS will pay the Repurchase Price and receive Common Stock with an aggregate value of 85% of the Repurchase Price based on the closing share price on February 8, 2022. The total number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR Agreements will be based on volume-weighted average prices of the Common Stock during the terms of the ASR transactions less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements. Upon final settlement of each ASR transaction, BMS may be entitled to receive additional shares of Common Stock from the applicable bank or, under certain circumstances specified in the ASR Agreements, BMS may be required to deliver shares of Common Stock or make a cash payment, at its option, to the applicable bank. 

The ASR Agreements contain provisions customary for agreements of this type, including provisions for adjustments to the transaction terms, the circumstances generally under which the ASR transactions may be accelerated, extended or terminated early by the applicable bank, and various acknowledgments, representations and warranties made by the parties to one another. The ASR transactions are scheduled to terminate in the second and third quarters of 2022, but each may conclude earlier than its scheduled termination date at the election of the applicable bank.
