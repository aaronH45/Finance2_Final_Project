Holders of Notes (each, a “Holder” and collectively, “Holders”) who validly tender Notes of a series after the applicable Early Tender Deadline, but at or prior to the applicable Expiration Date (as defined below), will receive the tender consideration for any such series accepted for purchase by the applicable Offeror, which is equal to the Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Premium (with respect to such series, the “Tender Consideration”).    

   *  Denotes a series of Notes for which the Total Consideration and the Tender Consideration will be determined taking into account the par call date, instead of the maturity date, of the Notes of such series in accordance with standard market practice.

The Offers are subject to the terms and conditions described in the Offer to Purchase dated February 15, 2022 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer to Purchase”) which sets forth a detailed description of the Offers, including (i) the Acceptance Priority Procedures (as described below), (ii) a $500 million maximum aggregate purchase price of the 2025 Pool Notes validly tendered in the 2025 Pool Offers, excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (the “2025 Pool Maximum”), (iii) a $500 million maximum aggregate purchase price of the 2026 Pool Notes validly tendered in the 2026 Pool Offers, excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (the “2026 Pool Maximum”), (iv) a $500 million maximum aggregate purchase price of the 2027 Pool Notes validly tendered in the 2027 Pool Offers, excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (the “2027 Pool Maximum”), (v) a $1.25 billion maximum aggregate purchase price of the 2029 Pool Notes validly tendered in the 2029 Pool Offers, excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (the “2029 Pool Maximum”), and (vi) a $1.25 billion maximum aggregate purchase price of the High Coupon Pool Notes validly tendered in the High Coupon Pool Offers, excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments (the “High Coupon Pool Maximum”). 

3 

The primary purpose of the Offers is to acquire the maximum principal amount of 2025 Pool Notes, 2026 Pool Notes, 2027 Pool Notes, 2029 Pool Notes and High Coupon Pool Notes in the designated priority order for which the aggregate purchase price (excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments) for each such group of Notes does not exceed the 2025 Pool Maximum, the 2026 Pool Maximum, the 2027 Pool Maximum, the 2029 Pool Maximum and the High Coupon Pool Maximum, respectively. The Offers are subject to certain other general conditions as described in the Offer to Purchase, as well as the condition that Bristol Myers Squibb shall have completed an offering of debt securities on terms and conditions satisfactory to Bristol Myers Squibb that results in the receipt of net proceeds that, when taken together with cash on hand, is sufficient to pay the consideration for all Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for purchase by Bristol Myers Squibb, plus accrued and unpaid interest and related fees and expenses (the “Financing Condition”). The Offers are not conditioned on any minimum amount of Notes being tendered, and none of the Offers are conditioned on the consummation of the other Offers. Each Offer may be amended, extended or, upon failure of a condition to be satisfied or waived prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline (for any Offers for which the Offerors elect to exercise their Early Settlement Right (as defined below)) or the applicable Expiration Date (for any Notes not settled on the Early Settlement Date), terminated individually. 

The Offers will each expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on March 15, 2022, unless extended or earlier terminated by the Offerors (such date and time with respect to an Offer, as the same may be extended with respect to such Offer, the “Expiration Date”). To be eligible to receive the Total Consideration, which includes the Early Tender Premium, Holders must validly tender their Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on March 1, 2022, unless extended (such date and time with respect to an Offer, as the same may be extended with respect to such Offer, the “Early Tender Deadline”). Holders who validly tender their Notes after the applicable Early Tender Deadline, but at or prior to the applicable Expiration Date, will be eligible to receive the Tender Consideration for any such series accepted for purchase. Bristol Myers Squibb expects to use the net proceeds from the concurrent offering of new notes announced today (the “Concurrent Notes Offering”), together with cash on hand, to pay to Holders whose Notes are accepted in an Offer the Total Consideration or the Tender Consideration, as applicable, and any Accrued Coupon Payments.

All Holders whose Notes are accepted in an Offer will receive a cash payment equal to accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes to, but not including, the relevant Settlement Date (as defined below) (the “Accrued Coupon Payment”) in addition to their Total Consideration or Tender Consideration, as applicable. 

  •   Notes may be validly withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on March 1, 2022, (such date and time with respect to an Offer, as the same may be extended with respect to such Offer), but not thereafter, unless extended with respect to any Offer. Holders should not tender any Notes that they do not wish to be accepted for purchase.     

  •   Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Condition and the other conditions of the Offers, the Acceptance Priority Procedures will operate concurrently, but separately, for the 2025 Pool Notes, 2026 Pool Notes, 2027 Pool Notes, 2029 Pool Notes and High Coupon Pool Notes, in each case subject to proration as described in the Offer to Purchase.     

On the terms and subject to the Financing Condition and the other conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Offerors are offering to purchase the following outstanding securities issued by it for the consideration described below: 

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Condition and the other conditions of the Offers, the “Acceptance Priority Procedures” will operate concurrently, but separately, for the (i) 2025 Pool Offers, (ii) 2026 Pool Offers, (iii) 2027 Pool Offers, (iii) 2029 Pool Offers, and (iv) High Coupon Pool Offers, in each case, as follows: 

  •   first, if the aggregate cash purchase price (excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments) of all 2025 Pool Notes, 2026 Pool Notes, 2027 Pool Notes, 2029 Pool Notes or High Coupon Pool Notes, as applicable, validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline by Holders does not exceed the applicable pool maximum, then the applicable Offeror will accept all such Notes. However, if the aggregate cash purchase price (excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments) of all 2025 Pool Notes, 2026 Pool Notes, 2027 Pool Notes, 2029 Pool Notes or High Coupon Pool Notes, as applicable, validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline by Holders exceeds the applicable pool maximum, then the Offerors will (i) accept such Notes for purchase for cash, starting at the highest acceptance priority level (level 1) and, if there is more than one priority level, moving sequentially to each lower acceptance priority level (the lowest of which is level 2 in the case of the 2027 Pool Offers and level 9 in the case of the High Coupon Pool Offers; the 2025 Pool Offers, 2026 Pool Offers and 2029 Pool Offers have only one priority level), until the aggregate cash purchase price (excluding the applicable Accrued Coupon Payments) of such Notes equals the applicable pool maximum, (ii) prorate the series of such Notes with the lowest acceptance priority level accepted for purchase for cash (including equal proration between Notes having the same priority but different Offerors) and (iii) not accept for purchase for cash (x) any such Notes of a series with an acceptance priority level below the prorated series or (y) any 2025 Pool Notes, 2026 Pool Notes, 2027 Pool Notes, 2029 Pool Notes or High Coupon Pool Notes, as applicable, validly tendered after the applicable Early Tender Deadline; and     

5 

  •   second, if the applicable pool maximum is not exceeded at the applicable Early Tender Deadline, the Offerors will repeat the steps described in the prior bullet with respect to all 2025 Pool Notes, 2026 Pool Notes, 2027 Pool Notes, 2029 Pool Notes or High Coupon Pool Notes, as applicable, validly tendered after the applicable Early Tender Deadline, but at or prior to the applicable Expiration Date, in order to determine the aggregate principal amount of such Notes that the applicable Offeror will accept for purchase in the 2025 Pool Offers, the 2026 Pool Offers, the 2027 Pool Offers, the 2029 Pool Offers or the High Coupon Pool Offers, as applicable.     

  •   All 2025 Pool Notes, regardless of acceptance priority level, that are validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline will have priority over 2025 Pool Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the applicable Expiration Date.     

  •   All 2026 Pool Notes, regardless of acceptance priority level, that are validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline will have priority over 2026 Pool Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the applicable Expiration Date.     

6 

  •   All 2027 Pool Notes, regardless of acceptance priority level, that are validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline will have priority over 2027 Pool Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the applicable Expiration Date.     

  •   All 2029 Pool Notes, regardless of acceptance priority level, that are validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline will have priority over 2029 Pool Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the applicable Expiration Date.     

  •   All High Coupon Pool Notes, regardless of acceptance priority level, that are validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline will have priority over High Coupon Pool Notes validly tendered after the applicable Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the applicable Expiration Date     

Provided that the Financing Condition and all the conditions to the 2025 Pool Offers, the 2026 Pool Offers, the 2027 Pool Offers, the 2029 Pool Offers, and/or the High Coupon Pool Offers have been satisfied or waived by the applicable Offeror by the applicable Early Tender Deadline, the Offerors may, but are not obligated to, elect to exercise their right (the “Early Settlement Right”), with respect to the Offers for which the conditions have been satisfied or waived, to settle all Notes validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase in such Offers (the “Early Settlement Date”). The Early Settlement Date will be determined at the Offerors’ option and is currently expected to occur on the third business day immediately following the Early Tender Deadline. If the Offerors elect to exercise their Early Settlement Right with respect to any 2025 Pool Notes, 2026 Pool Notes, 2027 Pool Notes, 2029 Pool Notes and/or High Coupon Pool Notes, in each case validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase, the Offerors will settle all such Notes on the Early Settlement Date. If the Offerors elect to exercise their Early Settlement Right with respect to the 2025 Pool Offers, the 2026 Pool Offers, the 2027 Pool Offers, the 2029 Pool Offers and/or the High Coupon Pool Offers, the Offerors will announce in a press release promptly after the applicable Early Tender Deadline that they are exercising their Early Settlement Right with respect to such Offers. On the Early Settlement Date, all Notes validly tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase in the Offers for which the Offerors have elected to exercise their Early Settlement Right will receive the applicable Total Consideration and Accrued Coupon Payment. The “Final Settlement Date,” if any, is the date on which the Offerors will settle all Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase and not previously settled on the Early Settlement Date. The Final Settlement Date is expected to be the second business day following the applicable Expiration Date, unless extended with respect to any Offer. Each of the Early Settlement Date and the Final Settlement Date is referred to as a “Settlement Date.”

If the Offerors terminate any Offer with respect to one or more series of Notes, they will give written notice thereof to the Tender and Information Agent (as defined below) and will make a public announcement thereof as promptly as practicable, and all Notes tendered pursuant to such terminated Offer will be returned promptly to the tendering Holders thereof. With effect from such termination, any Notes blocked in The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will be released. Holders are advised to check with any bank, securities broker or other intermediary through which they hold Notes as to when such intermediary would need to receive instructions from a beneficial owner in order for that holder to be able to participate, or withdraw their instruction to participate, in the Offers before the deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase. The deadlines set by any such intermediary and DTC for the submission and withdrawal of tender instructions will also be earlier than the relevant deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase.
