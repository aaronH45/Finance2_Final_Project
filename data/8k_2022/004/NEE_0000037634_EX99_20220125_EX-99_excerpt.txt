JUNO BEACH, Fla. - NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported 2021 fourth-quarter net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $1,204 million, or $0.61 per share, compared to net losses attributable to NextEra Energy of $5 million, or $0.00 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's 2021 fourth-quarter earnings were $814 million, or $0.41 per share, compared to $785 million, or $0.40 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

For the full year 2021, NextEra Energy reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP

basis of $3.573 billion, or $1.81 per share, compared to $2.919 billion, or $1.48 per share, in 2020. On

an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's full-year 2021 earnings were $5.021 billion, or $2.55 per share,

compared to $4.552 billion, or $2.31 per share, in 2020, which represents year-over-year growth in

adjusted earnings per share of approximately 10.4%.

Adjusted earnings for these periods exclude the effects of non-qualifying hedges; NextEra Energy Partners, LP net investment gains; gain on disposal of a business; differential membership interests-related; change in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds and other than temporary impairments (OTTI); and an impairment charge.

NextEra Energy's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy's management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy's fundamental earnings power. A reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income attributable to NextEra Energy, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is included in the attachments to this news release.

Effective Jan. 1, 2021, Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power & Light Company. Gulf Power continued as a separate reportable segment of Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. "FPL" refers to Florida Power & Light, excluding Gulf Power, unless otherwise noted or when using the term "combined."

"NextEra Energy was successful in executing our 2021 initiatives, ending the year with excellent financial and operational results," said Jim Robo, chairman and chief executive officer of NextEra Energy. "We grew adjusted earnings per share by more than 10% from 2020 and delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Utilities Index in terms of total shareholder return on a three-, five-, 10- and 15-year basis. We delivered this terrific performance while executing on the largest capital program in our history, investing approximately $16 billion in American infrastructure in 2021, and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in our industry. 

"At Florida Power & Light, we reached a fair and balanced outcome in our base rate case, while continuing to deliver on our best-in-class value proposition to customers. Under the new agreement, we expect our average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be between 8% and 9% through 2025. NextEra Energy Resources had a record year in 2021 for renewables and storage origination, adding a net approximately 7,200 megawatts to the backlog as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring in our nation's generation fleet. We have grown our backlog of signed contracts by nearly 25% year-over-year, and we are well on our way to meeting our current development expectations from 2021 through 2024.  

"Based on the continued strength of the investment opportunities at both Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy Resources, today we are announcing an increase to our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2022 and 2023 and introducing expectations for 2024 and 2025. For 2022, we are now expecting our adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85. Additionally, we now expect to be able to achieve roughly 6% to 8% per year growth in adjusted earnings per share off our revised 2022 adjusted earnings per share ranges through 2025, subject to our usual caveats. I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, while, at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings and continuing to reliably deliver for our customers. We are proud of our long-term track record of providing growth and value creation opportunities for our shareholders, and we are as confident as ever in the long-term growth prospects for NextEra Energy and our underlying businesses."

FPL

FPL reported fourth-quarter 2021 net income of $560 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to $502 million, or $0.25 per share, for the prior-year comparable quarter. For the full year 2021, FPL reported net income of $2.935 billion, or $1.49 per share, compared to $2.650 billion, or $1.35 per share, in 2020. FPL, including Gulf Power, serves more than 5.7 million customer accounts, supporting more than 11 million residents across Florida, and is the largest vertically integrated rate-regulated electric utility in the U.S. as measured by retail electricity produced and sold.

FPL's full-year growth was primarily driven by continued investment in the business. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.8 billion. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 82,000 from the prior-year comparable quarter.

During 2021, Florida Power & Light reached a fair and balanced outcome in its base rate case while continuing to deliver on its commitment to smart, long-term investments in innovative technology, clean energy and strengthening its electric grid for the benefit of its customers. The 2021 settlement agreement supports continued smart capital investments, including the largest solar build-out in the U.S. by a utility, while keeping FPL's typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in 

2

Florida through the end of 2025. For customers in Northwest Florida, typical customer bills are projected to decline over the next four years. 

Throughout the last year, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing another 671 megawatts (MW) of cost-effective solar in service, which completed the first phase of its SolarTogether community solar program. As a result of its recent rate case settlement, FPL anticipates installing another approximately 4,800 MW of new solar over the term of the settlement agreement. Additionally, in December 2021, FPL commissioned the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, the 409-MW Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will allow FPL customers to continue to benefit from low-cost renewable energy. Beyond solar, construction on both the highly efficient, roughly 1,200-MW Dania Beach Clean Energy Center and the North Florida Resiliency Connection remain on schedule and on budget as they continue to advance toward projected commercial operation dates later this year.

While maintaining its best-in-class customer value proposition, FPL continued to provide exceptional

service reliability, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2021. FPL recently was recognized for the sixth time in seven years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation and, last year, ranked number one in both residential and business customer satisfaction in the Southern U.S. among large electric providers by J.D. Power.

Gulf Power 

Gulf Power reported fourth-quarter 2021 net income of $60 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to $53 million, or $0.03 per share, for the prior-year quarter. For the full year 2021, Gulf Power reported net income of $271 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to $238 million, or $0.12 per share, in 2020. 

Gulf Power's capital expenditures for the full year 2021 were roughly $800 million, and regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 15% year-over-year.

On Jan. 1, 2022, FPL completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power and began serving the existing Northwest Florida customers under unified rates and tariffs. 

Over the past three years, Gulf Power has realized a nearly 40% reduction in operations and maintenance costs and increased regulatory capital employed by an approximately 16% compound annual growth rate. Since 2018, NextEra Energy has invested approximately $2.5 billion in long-term improvements to Gulf Power's existing system and generation fleet, including the installation of approximately 225 MW of new solar. These clean power modernization investments at Gulf Power have resulted in a roughly 25% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions over the last three years.

Gulf Power also has meaningfully improved its customer value proposition in the last three years. Since 2018, Gulf Power improved service reliability by nearly 60% and was awarded national recognition for its outstanding reliability performance in the Southeast suburban and rural service area for the second year in a row in 2021. Over the same period, Gulf Power realized an approximately 60% improvement in safety. 

NextEra Energy Resources 

NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive clean energy business of NextEra Energy, reported a fourth-quarter 2021 net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $851 million, or $0.43 per share, compared to net loss attributable to NextEra Energy of $644 million, or $0.33 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources' earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $414 million, or $0.21 per share, compared to $342 million, or $0.17 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2020.

For the full year 2021, NextEra Energy Resources reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $599 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to $531 million, or $0.27 per share, in 2020.

Outlook 

NextEra Energy today announced increased financial expectations for 2022 and 2023 and extended its long-term outlook of roughly 6% to 8% compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share by two years, through 2025. For 2022, NextEra Energy now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, up from its prior range of $2.55 to $2.75. For 2023 through 2025, NextEra Energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% per year off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share. For 2023, this translates to a new range of $2.93 to $3.08, up from the prior range of $2.77 to $2.97. The new adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2024 are $3.13 to $3.33, and for 2025 are $3.35 to $3.60. 

NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards; the effects of non-qualifying hedges and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds and OTTI, none of which can be determined at this time. Adjusted earnings expectations also exclude the effects of NextEra Energy Partners, LP net investment gains and differential membership interests-related. In addition, adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions; supportive commodity markets; current forward curves; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; divestitures to NextEra Energy Partners, LP; no acquisitions; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental tax policy or incentives.
