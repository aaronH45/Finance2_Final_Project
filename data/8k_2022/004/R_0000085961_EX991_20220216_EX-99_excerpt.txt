CEO Comment

Commenting on the company's results and outlook, Ryder Chairman and CEO Robert Sanchez says, "I am very pleased with record fourth-quarter and full-year comparable earnings driven by strong FMS results. For the full year, we generated record ROE of 21%, reflecting strong demand and pricing in used vehicle sales and rental, as well as benefits from our multi-year lease pricing and maintenance cost-savings initiatives. We also generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion and free cash flow of $1.1 billion, our second consecutive year of very strong free cash flow.

"We made significant progress on our strategy to create long-term shareholder value by improving returns in fleet management and accelerating growth in supply chain and dedicated. Tight truck capacity fueled an exceptionally strong rental and used vehicle sales market. We have repriced approximately 40% of the lease fleet at higher return spreads and lower residual value assumptions; raising and de-risking portfolio returns. We expect incremental benefits in the coming years as we re-price the remaining leases upon renewal. We have now delivered $90 million of the $100 million multi-year annual maintenance cost savings initiative we established in 2019 and expect to surpass that goal in 2022.

"In supply chain and dedicated, we achieved record new contract wins that are expected to generate profitable growth in 2022 and beyond. We also recently completed two acquisitions that provide us enhanced capabilities in the fast-growing e-commerce and omnichannel fulfillment segment, as well as in multi-client warehousing. Although earnings in these segments were negatively impacted by labor shortages and wage increases as well as automotive supply chain disruptions, we are making progress with our customers to implement related price adjustments. 

"We expect a strong used vehicle sales and rental environment to continue in 2022, slowly moderating in the second half of the year. We plan to continue to benefit from our lease pricing initiative. We also expect our supply chain and dedicated businesses to achieve their high single-digit earnings targets in the second half of the year. This reflects the benefits of growth from new contract signings and pricing adjustments addressing labor and supply chain disruptions.

"Our capital allocation strategy and improved returns have strengthened our balance sheet. Based on our outlook, and consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we intend to enter into a $300 million accelerated share repurchase program. After completing this program, we still expect to have capacity for acquisitions and the existing share repurchase programs.

"Lastly, based on the results from our return improvement actions to-date, as well as planned initiatives and our outlook, we have raised our ROE target over the cycle from 15% to a high-teens range, driven by an improved long-term outlook for FMS returns."

Fourth Quarter Business Segment Operating Results

Fleet Management Solutions: Higher Earnings Reflect Strong Used Vehicle Sales, Rental, and Lease Results

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

FMS total and operating revenue increased primarily due to higher rental revenue driven by strong demand and higher pricing. Total revenue also increased from higher fuel pricing.

FMS EBT increased by $195 million from improved used vehicle sales, rental, and lease performance, reflecting benefits from tight truck capacity and initiatives to improve returns. Higher gains on used 

3

vehicles sold and a declining impact of depreciation expense from prior vehicle residual value estimate changes contributed $123 million in higher year-over-year earnings. Used vehicle pricing approximately doubled from the prior year and ending inventory levels declined to 2,500 vehicles, which is significantly below the company's long-term target range of 7,000 - 9,000 vehicles. Rental results benefited from record utilization and a 10% increase in power fleet pricing. Rental power fleet utilization increased to 85% (up from 79% in the prior year) on a 16% larger average power fleet. Lease results benefited from higher pricing with revenue per average active vehicle up 4%, partially offset by a 2% smaller average active lease fleet, reflecting OEM vehicle delivery delays. FMS EBT as a percentage of FMS operating revenue is above the company's long-term target of high single-digits for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. 

Supply Chain Solutions: Earnings from Revenue Growth More Than Offset by Lower Automotive Results, Strategic Investments, and Medical Costs

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SCS total revenue increased due to strong revenue growth in all industry verticals. SCS operating revenue increased primarily due to new business, increased volumes, and the Midwest Warehouse & Distribution System acquisition; however, it was partially offset by the impact from supply chain disruptions in the automotive vertical.

SCS EBT declined primarily due to lower earnings in the automotive vertical as a result of supply chain disruptions and labor challenges. Earnings from increased pricing and new business were offset by strategic investments and medical costs. SCS EBT as a percentage of SCS operating revenue is below the company's long-term target of high single-digits for the fourth quarter and full year 2021.

4

Dedicated Transportation Solutions: Earnings from Revenue Growth More Than Offset by Higher Labor and Insurance Costs

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

DTS total and operating revenue increased due to new business, higher volumes, and increased pricing. Revenue growth from new business was driven by wins from competitors and private fleet conversions.

DTS EBT decreased primarily due to increased labor and insurance costs, partially offset by earnings from increased pricing and new business. DTS EBT as a percentage of DTS operating revenue is below the company's long-term target of high single-digits for the fourth quarter and full year 2021.

5

Corporate Financial Information

Unallocated Central Support Services (CSS)

Unallocated CSS costs were $15 million as compared to $49 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting a one-time expense of $28 million in the prior year for a bonus paid to frontline workers.

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 22.8% as compared to a benefit of 10.6% in the prior year. The prior-year tax rate was impacted by a reduction in earnings due to depreciation charges.

Capital Expenditures, Cash Flow, and Leverage 

Full-year capital expenditures increased to $2.0 billion in 2021 compared to $1.1 billion in 2020 due to higher planned investments in the rental and lease fleets, partially offset by approximately $400 million due to OEM vehicle delivery delays.

Full-year net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations remained at $2.2 billion, reflecting higher earnings, offset by higher working capital needs. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) was $1.1 billion, down from $1.6 billion in 2020 due to an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue-earning equipment.

Debt-to-equity as of December 31, 2021 declined to 235% from 293% at year-end 2020 and is below the company's long-term target of 250% - 300%. The decrease in debt-to-equity from year-end 2020 reflects increased earnings.

Fleet Management Solutions UK Business Update

As part of our strategy to improve returns in FMS, we intend to exit the lower return UK business over the next 12 to 18 months, subject to consultation obligations under UK law.

Note: Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements and information included in this news release are “forward-looking statements” under the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including our forecast, expectations regarding market trends and economic environment; impact of COVID-19 effects, including supply chain and labor shortage challenges, on market conditions, e-commerce trends, freight environment, earnings, depreciation, commercial rental demand and utilization, and used vehicle sales volume and pricing; expected benefits from our strategic investments and initiatives, including our recent supply chain acquisitions; expected benefits of lease pricing initiatives; our intent to execute an accelerated share repurchase program and any expected benefits in relation thereto; our intent to exit from the UK market, including expectations with respect to timing and expected benefits; our ability to execute our strategy of focusing our capital on higher returning businesses; our asset management strategy; performance, including sales and revenue growth, in our product lines and segments; residual values and depreciation expense; used vehicle inventory; earnings; free cash flow; operating cash flow; capital expenditures; fleet growth; and expected benefits from new contracts and pricing initiatives in our supply chain and dedicated business divisions. Our forward-looking statements also include our estimates of the impact of our changes to residual value estimates on earnings and depreciation expense. The expected impact of the change in residual value estimates is based on our current assessment of the residual values and useful lives of revenue-earning equipment based on multi-year trends and our outlook for the expected near- and long-term used vehicle market. A variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause residual value estimates to differ from actual used vehicle sales pricing, such as changes in supply and demand of used vehicles; volatility in market conditions; changes in vehicle technology; competitor pricing; regulatory requirements; driver shortages; customer requirements and preferences; and changes in underlying assumption factors.

All of our forward-looking statements should be evaluated by considering the many risks and uncertainties inherent in our business that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, lower than expected contractual sales, decreases in commercial rental demand or utilization or poor acceptance of rental pricing, declining market demand for or excess supply of used vehicles impacting current or estimated pricing and our anticipated proportion of retail versus wholesale sales; declining customer demand for our services; higher than expected maintenance costs; lower than expected benefits from our cost-savings initiatives; lower than expected benefits from our sales, marketing and new product initiatives; higher than expected costs related to our ERP implementation; setbacks in the economic market or in our ability to retain profitable customer accounts; impact of changing laws and regulations; difficulty in obtaining adequate profit margins for our services; inability to maintain current pricing levels due to soft economic conditions, business interruptions or expenditures due to labor disputes, severe weather or natural occurrences; competition from other service providers and new entrants; driver and technician shortages resulting in higher procurement costs and turnover rates; impact of worldwide semiconductor shortage, higher than expected bad debt reserves or write-offs; decrease in credit ratings; increased debt costs; adequacy of accounting estimates; higher than expected reserves and accruals particularly with respect to pension, taxes, insurance and revenue; impact of changes in our residual value estimates and accounting policies, including our depreciation policy; unanticipated changes in fuel prices; unanticipated currency exchange rate fluctuations; our ability to manage our cost structure; and the risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The risks included here are not exhaustive. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risks on our business. Accordingly, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

16

Comparable Earnings Measures:

Comparable Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes (EBT)

Comparable Earnings (Loss)

Comparable Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Common Share (EPS)

Adjusted Return on Equity (ROE)

Comparable EBT, comparable earnings and comparable EPS are defined, respectively, as GAAP EBT, earnings and EPS, all from continuing operations, excluding (1) non-operating pension costs, net and (2) any other significant items that are not representative of our business operations. We believe these comparable earnings measures provide useful information to investors and allow for better year-over-year comparison of operating performance.

Non-operating pension costs, net: Our comparable earnings measures exclude non-operating pension costs, which include the amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service cost, interest cost and expected return on plan assets components of pension and postretirement benefit costs, as well as any significant charges for settlements or curtailments if recognized. We exclude non-operating pension costs, net because we consider these to be impacted by financial market performance and outside the operational performance of our business.

Other Items Impacting Comparability: Our comparable and adjusted earnings measures also exclude other significant items that are not representative of our business operations as detailed in the reconciliation table below. These other significant items vary from period to period and, in some periods, there may be no such significant items.

Adjusted ROE is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by adjusted average shareholders' equity and represents the rate of return on shareholders' investment. Other items impacting comparability described above are excluded, as applicable, from the calculation of net earnings and average shareholders' equity. We use adjusted ROE as an internal measure of how effectively we use the owned capital invested in our operations.

Comparable Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)

Comparable EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss), first adjusted to exclude discontinued operations and the following items, all from continuing operations: (1) non-operating pension costs, net and (2) any other items that are not representative of our business operations (these items are the same items that are excluded from comparable earnings measures for the relevant periods as described immediately above) and then adjusted further for (1) interest expense, (2) income taxes, (3) depreciation, (4) used vehicle sales results and (5) amortization.

We believe comparable EBITDA provides investors with useful information, as it is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure financial performance and our ability to service debt and meet our payment obligations. In addition, we believe that the inclusion of comparable EBITDA provides consistency in financial reporting and enables analysts and investors to perform meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results. Other companies may calculate comparable EBITDA differently; therefore, our presentation of comparable EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

Comparable EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss), earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes or earnings (loss) from continuing operations determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.
