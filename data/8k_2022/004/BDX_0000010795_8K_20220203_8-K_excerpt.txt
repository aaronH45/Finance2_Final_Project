ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

On February 3, 2022, Becton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that differ from those presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP measures”), as follows:

•Currency-Neutral Revenue Growth. We present revenue growth rates for the first fiscal quarter and the corresponding prior period, and our estimated revenue growth for our fiscal year 2022, after eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation, which can fluctuate from period to period. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. 

•Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share. We present diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for the first fiscal quarter and the corresponding prior period, after eliminating items that we believe are not part of our ordinary operations and affect the comparability of the periods presented (“adjusted EPS”). Adjusted EPS includes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, integration and restructuring costs, spin-off related charges, certain transaction gains and losses, certain legal defense and product remediation costs, certain regulatory costs, certain investment gains and losses, the impact of the extinguishment of debt and the dilutive impact of outstanding preferred stock. We believe adjustments for these items allow investors to better understand the underlying operating results of BD and facilitate comparisons between the periods shown. We also show the growth in adjusted EPS compared to the prior year period after eliminating the impact of foreign currency translation to further enable investors to evaluate BD’s underlying earnings performance compared to the prior period. 

Details regarding these adjustments can be found in the schedules included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1

We also present our estimated revenue and adjusted EPS growth for our 2022 fiscal year after adjusting for the anticipated impact of foreign currency translation. Management believes that this adjustment allows investors to better evaluate BD’s anticipated underlying earnings performance for our 2022 fiscal year in relation to our underlying 2021 fiscal year performance.

BD’s management believes that the use of non-GAAP measures to adjust for items that are considered by management to be outside of BD’s underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability helps investors to gain a

better understanding of our performance year-over-year, to analyze underlying trends in our businesses, to analyze our base operating results, and understand future prospects. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to measure and forecast the company’s performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. We believe presenting such adjusted metrics provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by BD management for its operational decision-making and for comparison for other companies within the medical technology industry. Although BD’s management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD’s net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. BD strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by BD may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered replacements for, and should be read together with, the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
