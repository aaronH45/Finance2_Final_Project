Members of Humana Inc.’s (the “Company”) senior management team are scheduled to meet with investors and analysts at industry conferences and various other meetings between January 6, 2022 and January 11, 2022. During the conferences and meetings, the Company intends to address its prospects and performance. The Company will not opine on any financial results or expectations for 2021 or 2022 at the meetings beyond those listed below since it is in the process of closing its books for the year ended December 31, 2021. The date and time of presentations to investors are available via the Investor Relations calendar of events on Humana’s website at humana.com.

Full Year 2021 Adjusted EPS Guidance

During the meetings, the Company intends to reaffirm its guidance of approximately $23.67 in diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”), or approximately $20.50 in adjusted earnings per common share (“Adjusted EPS”), in each case for the year ending December 31, 2021 (“FY 2021”). This guidance is consistent with the guidance issued in Humana’s press release dated November 3, 2021 and reaffirmed on December 1, 2021.

The Company has included Adjusted EPS in this current report, a financial measure that is not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Management believes that this measure, when presented in conjunction with the comparable measure of GAAP EPS, is useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the Company’s ongoing business and operating performance. Consequently, management uses Adjusted EPS as an indicator of the Company’s business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP EPS. A reconciliation of GAAP EPS to Adjusted EPS follows:

Full-Year 2022 Enrollment Projections

Based on annual election period (“AEP”) growth of approximately 130,000 members, the Company is decreasing its net membership growth estimate for its individual Medicare Advantage products for the year ended December 31, 2022 to a range of 150,000 to 200,000 members from the previous range of 325,000 to 375,000 members. The revised estimate is primarily attributable to higher than anticipated terminations during the AEP, combined with the expectation of higher than originally projected terminations for the remainder of 2022. 

In addition, the Company continues to expect group Medicare Advantage membership to be generally flat for 2022, as it does not anticipate any large accounts will be gained or lost as it continues to maintain pricing discipline in a highly competitive market. 

For PDP, the Company now estimates a net membership decline of approximately 125,000 members for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to its previous estimate of a loss of ‘a few hundred thousand members’. The revised estimate is primarily attributable to better than expected sales of the Walmart Value plan and lower than projected Premier plan terminations. 

Full Year 2022 Adjusted EPS Guidance Discussion

The Company also intends to reiterate its 2022 Adjusted EPS guidance commentary, as shared on its third quarter 2021 earnings call on November 3, 2021, indicating that its initial Adjusted EPS guidance will target the low end of its long-term growth range of 11 to 15 percent, off of the $21.50 mid-point of its original 2021 Adjusted EPS guide. The Company currently anticipates that COVID will be net neutral to the Medicare Advantage business in 2022. However, the Company’s initial 2022 Adjusted EPS guidance will include an explicit COVID related headwind that it expects to be able to tolerate should it emerge.  

The Company plans to host a conference call and announce its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021, as well as provide detailed financial guidance for the year ended December 31, 2022, including quantification of the explicit COVID headwind to be included in its initial 2022 Adjusted EPS guide, on Wednesday, February 2, 2022.
