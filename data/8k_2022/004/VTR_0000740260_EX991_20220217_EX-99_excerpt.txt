 Ventas Reports 2021 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results  

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 17, 2022--Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2021.  

 “We are proud of our company and team in 2021. With a relentless focus on execution, we drove the business forward amid continuing waves of COVID-19 and generated fourth quarter results ahead of our expectations. During the year we positioned Ventas to capture the upside in the multi-year senior housing recovery, delivered strong organic growth in our Office and healthcare triple-net businesses and enhanced the Company’s portfolio and financial strength. We also extended our long track record of value-creating external growth with $3.7 billion in new investments focused on our strategic priorities of senior housing and life science,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and CEO.  

 “As we look into 2022, the senior housing recovery is underway, with accelerating demand, strong rate increases and rapidly improving clinical conditions in our communities. In the first quarter of 2022, we are projecting ten percent revenue growth in our SHOP business supported by record high leads. Further supported by favorable market supply demand fundamentals, we expect sustained improvement in SHOP NOI through 2022.  

 “Sustained strength in our attractive Medical Office and growing Life Science, Research & Innovation businesses, investment accretion and receipt of HHS Grants also contribute to our positive outlook in the first quarter.  

 “We remain committed to enhancing value for our shareholders and other stakeholders in 2022 and beyond by capitalizing on organic growth from our high-quality diversified portfolio, robust external growth and our outstanding ESG profile,” Cafaro concluded.  

 Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results:    Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Attributable Net Income (Loss)”) per share of ($0.10)   Nareit Funds from Operations (“FFO”)* per share of $0.63   Normalized FFO* per share of $0.73   The above earnings measures include $6 million ($0.015 per share) benefit of HHS Grants (defined below), the majority of which were attributable to the Company’s unconsolidated joint venture investments and the balance to the Company’s SHOP portfolio.

 2021 Company Highlights and Recent Developments:  

 Senior Housing Highlights and Recent Actions:  

 Fourth Quarter 2021 SHOP Performance Highlights:    Total SHOP portfolio NOI achieved the high end of our expectations in the fourth quarter 2021.   Same-store average occupancy grew by 200 basis points to 83.4% in the fourth quarter 2021 versus fourth quarter 2020.   Rate and revenue grew for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Same-store revenue increased 3.3% in the fourth quarter 2021 versus the fourth quarter 2020 on higher occupancy and stronger pricing.   Same-store net operating income (“NOI”)* declined 3.6% (excluding HHS Grants) in the fourth quarter 2021 versus the fourth quarter 2020 driven by elevated labor costs resulting from the pandemic.   Same-store NOI in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter 2021 was stable, incorporating anticipated elevated labor expenses.   

 Recent Actions:  

 The Company has taken a series of actions in its senior housing portfolio with the objective of capturing meaningful upside in the expected cyclical industry recovery. Continuing its strategy of the “right asset, in the right market, with the right operator,” the Company has acted upon nearly two-thirds of its senior housing portfolio via acquisition, disposition, development, lease resolution or operator transition since 2020. Specific actions in 2021 include the following:    Acquired nearly $2.6 billion of higher margin, independent living communities with favorable market characteristics, relatively low labor requirements and a three-year average length of stay.   Expanded the Company’s high performing Canadian portfolio through an acquisition of five independent living and one assisted living communities and leased up three recently opened communities in our Class A Le Groupe Maurice portfolio to 92% occupancy.   Enhanced portfolio quality via disposition of 29 non-core senior housing properties resulting in approximately $400 million gross proceeds to Ventas at an approximate 2.5% cash yield.   Added six new senior housing operating partner relationships, increasing Ventas’s distinct operator relationships to 37.   Transitioned 90 senior living communities to seven new experienced operators that will provide strong local market focus and oversight for the communities and take advantage of the expected industry recovery.   Leveraged deep senior housing operating experience to enhance our performance, management and insights platform enabling the Company to add further value to its operating partners, and leading to greater foresight into industry trends, including recent labor trends witnessed in the industry.   Drove largest effective rate increases in recent history while at the same time reducing the financial move-out rate – a testament to the quality of our operators and our precision approach to pricing strategy.

 Office Highlights and Recent Actions:  

 Fourth Quarter 2021 Office Performance Highlights:    Medical Office Building (“MOB”) fourth quarter same-store cash NOI* grew 3.4% year-over-year, the second consecutive quarterly same-store growth rate exceeding 3%.   MOB same-store occupancy increased sequentially in the fourth quarter for the fifth consecutive quarter, with tenant retention of 92% and new leasing up 54% in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the prior year.   Life Science, Research & Innovation (“R&I”) fourth quarter 2021 occupancy ended at 94% due to continued strong demand for life science space.   The previously announced $1 billion Life Science, R&I development pipeline, comprising 1.4 million square feet across five buildings affiliated with University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, University of Pittsburgh and Arizona State University, which have been recently completed or are currently under construction, are 85% leased or committed.   

 Recent Actions:  

 Strong performance in the Office business, which now represents a third of Ventas’s portfolio, has been driven by operational initiatives generating organic growth combined with new investments that enhance the Life Science, R&I and MOB portfolios.    Since 2020, Ventas has created a centralized leasing center of excellence, built a technical engineering team, expanded our tenant satisfaction programs and established a digital marketing program focused on local market awareness and virtual touring of vacant suites.   For the second year in a row, Ventas ranked in the top quartile of its peers for tenant satisfaction as measured by Kingsley Associates. Rankings for 2021 increased for each major key performance indicator compared to 2020, including renewal intentions in the top decile when compared to Ventas peers.   Enhanced portfolio quality via disposition of over 30 non-core MOBs resulting in approximately $440 million gross proceeds to Ventas at an approximate 5% cash yield. These transactions increased occupancy by approximately 250 basis points and Ventas’s on-campus share of MOBs by approximately 325 basis points.   The Company acquired or announced over $1 billion of Office investments in 2021 focused on high quality Medical Office and Life Science, R&I. The Company also funded and progressed the ground-up Life Science, R&I developments that were already underway.   Ventas delivered the Assembly, anchored by the world-renowned University of Pittsburgh in collaboration with University of Pittsburgh Medical Center researchers under a long-term lease. The Assembly, which is over 90% leased or committed, is a meticulously rendered life science and innovation center focused on cutting-edge immunotherapy and transplantation research. The iconic campus, containing 350,000 square feet, is expected to achieve an 8% GAAP yield upon stabilization with total project costs of $278 million.

 External Growth and New Investments:  

 In 2021, Ventas completed or announced $3.7 billion in strategic investments focused on expanding our portfolio of high-quality senior housing assets, growing its advantaged Life Science, R&I portfolio and selectively expanding its Medical Office footprint. Since 2010, the Company has averaged over $3 billion in new investments annually, including single asset deals, portfolio transactions, public mergers and new development commitments.  

 In February 2022:    Ventas closed on the previously announced acquisition of 18 MOBs comprising 732,000 square feet from Ardent Health Services for $204 million. The portfolio is located in Ardent’s existing markets, is over 90% on campus and 100% leased to Ardent with an expected GAAP yield of 5.8%.   Ventas completed the acquisition of Mangrove Bay, a Class A senior housing community in the highly sought-after Jupiter, Florida market for $107 million at an attractive in-place yield of 5.6%. Favorable local market dynamics, including attractive demographics and limited existing or new competition, underpin Mangrove Bay’s strong occupancy and financial performance.   

 Ensured Financial Strength and Flexibility:  

 In 2021, the Company enhanced its portfolio and strengthened its balance sheet through $1.2 billion in asset dispositions and loan repayments. Non-core senior housing and MOB asset sales comprised approximately $850 million of proceeds at a below 4% cap rate and the repayment of several well-structured loans generated $350 million at an average yield exceeding 9%. Proceeds were principally used to pay down $1.1 billion in near-term debt maturities. To manage interest rate risk, the Company raised over $1.1 billion in new bonds in the US and Canada, including a 10-year offering with a coupon of 2.5%, the best 10-year healthcare REIT issuance in 2021. Key financial statistics at year-end include:    $2.5 billion year-end liquidity   36% year-end Total Indebtedness to Gross Asset Value   Average cost of debt of 3.4% with a total weighted average maturity of over 6 years   Of the total debt outstanding, 91% is at fixed interest rates, an increase of 4 percentage points versus prior year   7.2x Fourth Quarter 2021 Net Debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA   

 Corporate Governance, Sustainability and Other Initiatives:    Refreshed the Ventas Board of Directors with the appointment of Maurice Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer of Health Care Service Corporation, on February 1, 2021. The Ventas Board currently comprises 11 directors, 10 of whom are independent.   Continued recognition as an Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) industry leader, receiving Nareit’s Leader in the Light Award for the sixth time, recognized in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the third consecutive year, achieving the GRESB Real Estate Sector Leader, and inclusion in the S&P DJSI World and North America indices.   Accelerated growth in Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”), Ventas’s institutional third-party capital business, in 2021. VIM provides a growth platform for Ventas and leverages its brand, industry knowledge, infrastructure and team. VIM currently has over $4.5 billion in Assets Under Management, including unfunded commitments, development projects underway and gross asset value. The Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund, a perpetual life vehicle, obtained over $730 million in new capital commitments from third party institutional investors during the year.

 1. Excluding the effect of the HHS Grants in all periods, Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (“SHOP”) year over year same store cash NOI growth was (3.6%) and sequentially was (0.9%). SHOP Same-Store cash NOI reflects grants received in 4Q21 and 4Q20 under the Provider Relief Fund administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (the “HHS Grants”). The HHS Grants are recorded as a contra expense within SHOP operating expenses. The Quarterly Pools include ~$1.9 million in HHS Grants received in 4Q21 and ~$26.1 million in HHS Grants received in 4Q20. The Sequential Pools include ~$1.9 million in HHS Grants received in 4Q21.  

 First Quarter 2022 Guidance  

 The Company currently expects to report first quarter 2022 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO per share and same-store Cash NOI growth within the following ranges, which include $33 million (or $0.08 per share) of net HHS Grants received to date in the first quarter 2022:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 1 Excluding the effect of the HHS Grants in all periods, the projected growth rate is expected to range from 6-15%. Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (“SHOP”) Same-Store Cash NOI reflects HHS Grants received in 1Q22, to date, and in 1Q21 under the Provider Relief Fund. The HHS Grants are recorded as a contra expense within SHOP operating expenses, net of any applicable fees to SHOP operators. The anticipated 1Q22 Quarterly Pool includes ~$21 million in net HHS Grants received in 1Q22, to date, and ~$8 million in HHS Grants received in 1Q21.  

 Key assumptions underlying the first quarter 2022 guidance include:    SHOP NOI Expectations: At the midpoint of the guidance, Ventas expects first quarter 2022 year-over-year same-store SHOP revenue to increase approximately 10% versus first quarter 2021. SHOP NOI is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 15% in the first quarter 2022, excluding net HHS Grants in all periods, with the range principally a function of operating expense assumptions.   Clinical Trends: Consistent with broader US trends, COVID-19 resident and staff confirmed cases increased sharply in January and into early February in Ventas’s SHOP communities but have recently declined dramatically.   Leading Indicators: Demand for senior housing continues to be robust. Leads have consistently trended at over 100% of pre-pandemic levels for nine consecutive months including January 2022, when leads reached their highest number since the onset of the pandemic.   Occupancy: Average occupancy for the first quarter 2022 in the same-store year-over-year SHOP business of 321 assets is expected to increase approximately 410 basis points at the midpoint of the Company’s expectations versus first quarter 2021. SHOP average occupancy for the first quarter 2022 in the same-store sequential SHOP business of 436 assets, is expected to decline by 20 basis points at the midpoint of the Company’s expectations, versus the fourth quarter 2021, outperforming normal seasonal trends and tempered by COVID-19 related impacts.   Revenue for the same-store SHOP business is expected to grow 10% at the midpoint of the Company’s expectations in the first quarter 2022 as compared to the first quarter 2021 principally through strong in-place rate increases implemented in the first quarter 2022 and improving re-leasing spreads.   Operating Expenses: A tight labor market, and increased staff absences due to COVID-19 protocols, have driven elevated labor and agency costs in the first quarter 2022 to date. At the guidance midpoint, Ventas expects operating costs to remain elevated through the first quarter even as COVID-19 clinical conditions moderate.   In the first quarter 2022, to date, the Company has received approximately $33 million of HHS Grants, net of fees to SHOP operators. The Company’s guidance assumes that no additional HHS Grants are received during the quarter.     The Office business year-over-year same-store cash NOI is expected to increase approximately 4.5% at the midpoint of the Company’s expectations versus first quarter 2021 due to occupancy growth in MOB and strong expense controls.   The guidance does not assume any new or unannounced material acquisitions or capital markets activities.   The guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 403 million shares.   The guidance assumes no material changes in the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business. The trajectory and future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of any variant, on various aspects of our business, remain highly uncertain and may change rapidly. The extent of the pandemic’s continuing and ultimate effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, including the speed at which clinical conditions improve, regulatory restrictions are loosened, and behavioral changes occur. Our guidance assumes continued improvement in these factors.

 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers FFO, Normalized FFO, FAD and Operating FAD to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results.  

 Further, the Company believes that FAD and Operating FAD are useful supplemental measures of the Company’s operating performance that would not otherwise be available and may be useful to investors in assessing the Company’s operating performance and performance as a REIT. The Company believes FAD and Operating FAD may provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s ability to generate income from its operating performance and the impact of the Company’s operating performance on its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company defines Normalized FFO as FFO excluding the following income and expense items (which may be recurring in nature): (a) transaction costs and expenses, including amortization of intangibles, transition and integration expenses and deal costs and expenses, including expenses and recoveries relating to acquisition lawsuits; (b) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark to market impacts on the Company’s income statement and non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration, severance-related costs and charitable donations to the Ventas Charitable Foundation; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other unusual items related to unconsolidated entities; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to natural disasters and (h) any other incremental items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.  

 Operating FAD represents Normalized FFO (i) excluding non-cash components and straight-line rent adjustments and (ii) including the impact of FAD Capital Expenditures. FAD Capital Expenditures are (i) Ventas-invested capital expenditures, whether routine or non-routine, that extend the useful life of a property but are not expected to generate incremental income for the Company; (ii) Office Building and Triple-Net leasing commissions paid to third-party agents; and (iii) capital expenditures for second-generation tenant improvements. It excludes (i) costs for a first generation lease (e.g., a development project) or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment and (ii) Initial Capital Expenditures, which are defined as capital expenditures required to bring a newly acquired or newly transitioned property up to standard. Initial Capital Expenditures are typically incurred within the first 12 months after acquisition or transition, respectively.  

 FAD represents Operating FAD after including the impact of transaction expenses, deal costs and unusual items related to unconsolidated entities.  

 FFO, Normalized FFO, FAD and Operating FAD presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. FFO, Normalized FFO, FAD and Operating FAD should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO, Normalized FFO, FAD and Operating FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.

 The Company’s guidance constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. Actual results may differ materially from the Company's expectations depending on factors discussed herein and in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment and valuation allowances), excluding gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, partners’ share of EBITDA of consolidated entities, transaction expenses and deal costs, net gains or losses on real estate activity, gains or losses on re-measurement of equity interest upon acquisition, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, net expenses or recoveries related to natural disasters and non-cash charges related to leases, and including (a) Ventas’ share of EBITDA from unconsolidated entities and (b) other immaterial or identified items.  

 The information above considers the pro forma effect on Adjusted EBITDA of the Company’s activity during the three months and year ended December 31, 2021 and the three months ended September 30, 2021, as if the transactions had been consummated as of the beginning of the period (“Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA”) and considers any other incremental items set forth in the Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA reconciliation included herein.  

 The Company believes that Net debt, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA and Net debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA are useful to investors, analysts and Company management because they allow the comparison of the Company’s credit strength between periods and to other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period.

 The Company considers NOI and Same-store cash NOI as important supplemental measures because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results and to compare its operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and office building and other services costs. In the case of NOI, cash receipts may differ due to straight-line recognition of certain rental income and the application of other GAAP policies.  

 The Company defines same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of its portfolio performance. Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s Seniors Housing Operating Portfolio (“SHOP”) will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Office and Triple-Net Leased Portfolios will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. SHOP and Triple-Net Leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.  

 Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by materially disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a materially disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for the Office and Triple-Net Leased Portfolios, those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase net operating income, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for the SHOP and Triple-Net Leased Portfolios, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.  

 To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average exchange rate for the current period.
