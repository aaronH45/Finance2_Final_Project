Summary of Fourth Quarter Results Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2020

•Total revenues increased 42.9% to $6.5 billion, driven primarily by higher pricing and higher volume across most of our services.

•Gross profits increased 33.7% to $850.7 million. Adjusted gross profits increased 33.7% to $856.3 million, primarily driven by higher adjusted gross profit per transaction and higher volume across most of our services.

•Operating expenses increased 31.2% to $568.9 million. Personnel expenses increased 35.8% to $420.0 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs and higher headcount, and also due to the benefit realized in the fourth quarter of 2020 from our short-term, pandemic-related cost reductions. Average headcount increased 11.9%. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses of $148.9 million increased 19.6%, primarily due to higher purchased services and travel expenses, both of which were reduced in the fourth quarter of 2020 by short-term, pandemic-related cost reductions.

•Income from operations totaled $287.4 million, up 39.0% due to the increase in adjusted gross profits, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses.  Adjusted operating margin of 33.6% increased 130 basis points.

•Interest and other expenses totaled $18.4 million, consisting primarily of $14.1 million of interest expense, which increased $1.8 million versus last year due to a higher average debt balance. The fourth quarter also included a $6.5 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses.

•The effective tax rate in the quarter was 14.5% compared to 24.1% in the fourth quarter last year. The rate decrease was due primarily to a favorable mix of foreign earnings and an increased benefit related to U.S. tax credits and incentives.

•Net income totaled $230.1 million, up 55.7% from a year ago. Diluted EPS of $1.74 increased 61.1%.

Summary of Full Year Results Compared to 2020

•Gross profits increased 30.7% to $3.1 billion. Adjusted gross profits increased 30.7% to $3.2 billion, primarily driven by higher adjusted gross profit per transaction and higher volume across most of our services.

•Operating expenses increased 19.0% to $2.1 billion. Personnel expenses increased 24.2% to $1.5 billion, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs and higher headcount, and also due to the benefit realized in 2020 from our short-term, pandemic-related cost reduction initiatives. SG&A expenses increased 6.1% to $526.4 million, primarily due to increases in purchased services and warehouse expenses, partially offset by decreases in amortization and bad debt expenses and by an $11.5 million loss on the sale-leaseback of a company-owned data center in 2020.

•Income from operations totaled $1.1 billion, up 60.7% from last year, primarily due to the increase in adjusted gross profits, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses.  Adjusted operating margin of 34.3% increased 640 basis points.

The full year also included a $15.1 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses. These expenses were partially offset by a $2.9 million local government subsidy in Asia for achieving specified performance criteria that was almost entirely offset by a reduction in foreign tax credits within the provision for income taxes.

•The effective tax rate for the full year was 17.4% compared to 19.4% in the year-ago period. The rate decrease was due primarily to a favorable mix of foreign earnings and an increased benefit related to U.S. tax credits and incentives.

NAST adjusted gross profits increased 19.7% in the quarter to $475.1 million.

Operating expenses increased 32.7% primarily due to higher incentive compensation and higher headcount, and also due to the benefit realized in 2020 from our short-term, pandemic-related cost reduction initiatives.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

____________________________________________

(1) Adjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure explained later in this release. The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not material.

Fourth quarter Robinson Fresh adjusted gross profits increased 10.2% to $26.0 million, due to an 11.5% increase in case volume. Managed Services adjusted gross profits increased 7.3% in the quarter, primarily due to a 2.5% increase in volume. Other Surface Transportation adjusted gross profits increased 24.2% to $19.1 million, primarily due to a 25.4% increase in Europe truckload adjusted gross profits, with the acquisition of Combinex Holding B.V. contributing 10.3 percentage points of growth to truckload adjusted gross profits.

Other Income Statement Items

The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 14.5%, down from 24.1% last year, and lower than our expectations, primarily due to a favorable mix of foreign earnings and an increased benefit from U.S. tax credits and incentives. We expect our 2022 full-year effective tax rate to be 19 to 21 percent.

Interest and other expenses totaled $18.4 million, consisting primarily of $14.1 million of interest expense, which increased $1.8 million versus last year due to a higher average debt balance. The fourth quarter also included a $6.5 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses. 

Diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were down 3.3% due primarily to share repurchases over the past twelve months.

Cash Flow Generation and Capital Distribution

Cash from operations totaled $75.9 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $162.1 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2020. The $86.3 million decrease in cash flow was primarily due to a $199.9 million sequential increase in net operating working capital in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to a $92.0 million sequential increase in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in net operating working capital in the fourth quarter of 2021 resulted primarily from a $278.6 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets, compared to a $78.7 million sequential increase in total accounts payable. 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, $222.8 million of cash was returned to shareholders, with $154.4 million in total repurchases of common stock and $68.4 million in cash dividends. 

Capital expenditures totaled $18.4 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be $90 million to $100 million, primarily driven by technology investments in our digital platform.

Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, the borrowing capacity on our accounts receivable securitization facility was expanded by an additional $200 million, bringing its total borrowing capacity to $500 million.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation

(unaudited, in thousands)

Our adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding amortization of internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. We believe adjusted gross profit is a useful measure of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider adjusted gross profit to be a primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations often focuses on the changes in our adjusted gross profit. The reconciliation of gross profit to adjusted gross profit is presented below (in thousands):[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as operating income divided by adjusted gross profit. We believe adjusted operating margin is a useful measure of our profitability in comparison to our adjusted gross profit which we consider a primary performance metric as discussed above. The comparison of operating margin to adjusted operating margin is presented below:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]
