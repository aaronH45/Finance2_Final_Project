Other Events.  

On January 27, 2022, S&P Global Inc. (the “Company”) announced that its wholly owned subsidiary S&P Global Market Intelligence Inc. (“Market Intelligence”) has extended the expiration date of the previously announced (i) offers to exchange (collectively, the “Exchange Offers”) any and all outstanding notes (the “IHS Markit Notes”) issued by IHS Markit Ltd. (“IHS Markit”) for up to $4,642,848,000 aggregate principal amount of new notes to be issued by the Company and cash and (ii) solicitations of consents (collectively, the “Consent Solicitations”) to adopt certain proposed amendments (the “Amendments”) that would eliminate substantially all restrictive covenants and certain events of default and other provisions in each of the indentures (collectively, the “IHS Markit Indentures”) governing the IHS Markit Notes, commenced by Market Intelligence on November 16, 2021. Market Intelligence extended such expiration date from 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 1, 2022, to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 22, 2022 (as the same may be further extended, the “Expiration Date”).  

On November 30, 2021, the requisite number of consents were received to adopt the Amendments with respect to all outstanding series of IHS Markit Notes, and IHS Markit executed supplemental indentures to the IHS Markit Indentures implementing the Amendments. The Amendments will become operative only upon the settlement of the Exchange Offers.  

The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations were commenced in connection with the pending merger between the Company and IHS Markit (the “Merger”) and are being made solely pursuant to the conditions set forth in the confidential offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement dated November 16, 2021 in a private offering exempt from, or not subject to, registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are conditioned, among other things, upon the closing of the Merger, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2022. The settlement of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations is expected to occur promptly after the Expiration Date and no earlier than the first business day after the closing date of the Merger.  

A copy of the Company’s press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
