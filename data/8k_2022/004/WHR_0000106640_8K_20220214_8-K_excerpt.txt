Item 8.01 Other Events

On February 14, 2022, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Whirlpool Corporation (the “Company”) authorized the repurchase of an additional $2 billion of the Company’s common stock under the Company’s ongoing share repurchase program. Approximately $1.5 billion remained available under the program as of December 31, 2021. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases, written trading plans to repurchase shares under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. 

The share repurchase program has no expiration date and does not obligate the Company to repurchase shares. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements and other investment opportunities. Information regarding share repurchases will be available in the Company’s periodic reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as required by the applicable rules of the Exchange Act.

In addition, on February 14, 2022, the Board approved a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend on the Company’s common stock to $1.75 per share from $1.40 per share.
