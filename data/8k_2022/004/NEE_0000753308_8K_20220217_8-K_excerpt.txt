SECTION 7 - REGULATION FD

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure

As disclosed in NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NEE) Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, the following is a discussion of recent events with regard to NextEra Energy Resources, LLC's (NextEra Energy Resources), a wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, equity method investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (Mountain Valley Pipeline).

On February 2, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (the 4th Circuit) vacated and remanded Mountain Valley Pipeline’s Biological Opinion issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and on January 25, 2022 the 4th Circuit vacated and remanded Mountain Valley Pipeline's U.S. Forest Service right-of-way grant. While NextEra Energy Resources continues to evaluate options and next steps with its joint venture partners, these events caused NextEra Energy Resources to re-evaluate its investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, which evaluation coincided with the preparation of NEE's December 31, 2021 financial statements. Based on an updated fair value analysis required for accounting purposes, NextEra Energy Resources recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of 2022 of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax), primarily to completely write off NextEra Energy Resources’ equity method investment carrying amount. NEE's adjusted earnings for 2022 will exclude the effect of this impairment charge.

SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
