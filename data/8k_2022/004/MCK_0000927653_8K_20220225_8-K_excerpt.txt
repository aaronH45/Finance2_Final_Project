Item 1.01Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On February 25, 2022, McKesson Corporation ("Company") and two other United States pharmaceutical distribution companies (collectively, "Distributors") determined that there is sufficient State and subdivision participation to proceed with an agreement ("Settlement") to settle a substantial majority of opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Distributors by U.S. states, territories and local governmental entities (collectively, "Settling Governmental Entities"). 

The Settlement will become effective on April 2, 2022. If all conditions to the Settlement are satisfied, including the receipt of approval by relevant courts of consent decrees to dismiss the lawsuits, the Distributors would pay the Settling Governmental Entities up to approximately $19.5 billion over 18 years, with up to approximately $7.4 billion to be paid by the Company for its 38.1% portion. Under the Settlement, a minimum of 85% of the settlement payments must be used by state and local governmental entities to remediate the opioid epidemic. Most of the remaining percentage relates to plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs, and would be payable over a shorter time period. Under the Settlement, the Distributors will establish a clearinghouse to consolidate their controlled-substance distribution data, which will be available to the settling U.S. states to use as part of their anti-diversion efforts. The Settlement provides that the Distributors do not admit liability or wrongdoing and do not waive any defenses.

The terms under which the Distributors previously agreed to settle opioids claims of the states of New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Florida and Texas, and each of their participating subdivisions, will become part of the Settlement. The previously disclosed agreement for the Distributors to settle opioids claims of the attorney general of West Virginia will remain a separate settlement arrangement that is not part of the Settlement. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, 46 of 49 eligible states, as well as the District of Columbia and all eligible territories, have agreed to join the Settlement. A list of the Distributors, states and territories that have agreed to the Settlement is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 7.01Other Events.

A news release issued by the Distributors on February 25, 2021 to announce the Settlement is attached as Exhibit 99.2.

Item 9.01Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(d) Exhibits.
