Under the director resignation requirement, any incumbent director who fails to receive a majority vote in an uncontested election is required to tender his or her resignation, subject to acceptance by the Board. The Company’s Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept the resignation, and the Board will act upon such resignation within 90 days from the date the election results are certified and then publicly disclose its determination. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the recommendation or decision with respect to his or her resignation. The full text of the Bylaws, as amended and restated, is filed as Exhibit 3.2 hereto.
