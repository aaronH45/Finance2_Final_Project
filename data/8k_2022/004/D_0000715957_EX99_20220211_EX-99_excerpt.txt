RICHMOND, Va. – Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) today announced an unaudited net income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (reported earnings) for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2021, of $1.3 billion ($1.63 per share) compared with a net gain of $682 million ($0.82 per share) for the same period in 2020. Reported earnings were a net gain, for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2021, of $3.3 billion ($3.98 per share) compared with a net loss of $401 million ($0.57 per share) for the same period in 2020. 

Operating earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2021, were $752 million ($0.90 per share), compared with operating earnings of $672 million ($0.81 per share) for the same period in 2020. Operating earnings for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2021, were $3.2 billion ($3.86 per share) compared with operating earnings of $3.0 billion ($3.54 per share) for the same period in 2020. 

GAAP earnings for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2021, relative to operating earnings reflect the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities, gains/losses on nuclear decommissioning trust funds, contributions of discontinued operations and the sale of Questar Pipelines, regulated asset retirements and other charges, and other adjustments. 

Operating earnings are defined as reported earnings adjusted for certain items. Details of operating earnings as compared to prior periods, business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this release.  

In addition, Dominion Energy has executed a definitive agreement to sell its West Virginia natural gas utility – Hope Gas, Inc. (Dominion Energy West Virginia or DEWV) – to Ullico Inc.’s infrastructure fund (Ullico) for $690 million. The transaction is expected to close late this year. 

Ullico plans to integrate DEWV with Hearthstone Utilities, Inc. (Hearthstone), a portfolio company that owns and operates gas utilities in Indiana, Maine, Montana, North Carolina, and Ohio. As part of the definitive agreement, Hearthstone will move its headquarters to West Virginia.   

The transaction value, achieved through a competitive sale process, represents approximately 26.2x 2021 net income and 2.0x 2021 year-end rate base. DEWV is a Clarksburg, W.Va.-based gas utility employing about 300 and serving 111,000 West Virginia customers. The sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission.

Important note to investors regarding operating, reported earnings 

Dominion Energy uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion Energy also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the Board of Directors, for the company’s incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion Energy management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company’s fundamental earnings power. 

In providing its operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, acquisitions, divestitures or extreme weather events and other natural disasters. Dominion Energy management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact of these items on future period reported earnings.
