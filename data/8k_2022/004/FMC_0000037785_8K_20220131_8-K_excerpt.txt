ITEM 5.04. TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF TRADING UNDER REGISTRANT’S EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

FMC Corporation (the “Company”) maintains the FMC Corporation Savings and Investment Plan (the “Plan”). One of the

investment alternatives for participants in the Plan is the FMC Stock Fund, through which participants may invest a portion of

their Plan account balance in FMC common stock. Effective March 1, 2017, the FMC Stock Fund was closed to new

contributions and participants’ investment in the FMC Stock Fund was limited to no more than 20% of their total Plan account

balance (subject to certain grandfathering rules).

A significant number of former employees (“Inactive Participants”) maintain Plan account balances with holdings in the FMC

Stock Fund that exceed 20% of their total account balance. In order to promote diversification and help reduce risk for such

Inactive Participants whose holdings in the FMC Stock Fund exceed 20% of their account balance as of March 4, 2022

(“Affected Participants”), the Plan administrator will liquidate a portion of the Affected Participant’s FMC Stock Fund holdings

so as to reduce such holdings to not more than 20% of the Affected Participant’s total Plan account balance. The proceeds

from such sale will be invested in the investment option designated by the Plan Administrator as the qualified default

investment alternative. Affected Participants have the opportunity to reduce their FMC Stock Fund holdings in their Plan

accounts to below the 20% cap before the deadline through voluntary self-directed transactions under the Plan.

As a result of the implementation of this risk reduction program, there will be a blackout period in which Affected Participants

and their beneficiaries temporarily will be unable to obtain a loan or distribution or direct or diversify their Plan investments in

the FMC Stock Fund under the Plan. This period of restriction is necessary in order to enable the Plan administrator to

liquidate holdings in the FMC Stock Fund to not more than 20% of any Affected Participant’s total Plan balance. The blackout

period will begin at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on March 7, 2022 and is expected to end during the week of March 13, 2022 (the

“Blackout Period”).

On January 31, 2022, the Plan administrator distributed a notice to Inactive Participants and their beneficiaries (the “ERISA

Blackout Period Notice”) describing the Blackout Period restrictions, as required by Section 101(i)(2)(B) of the Employee

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

The foregoing description of the ERISA Blackout Period Notice does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety

by reference to the complete text of the ERISA Blackout Period Notice, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is

incorporated herein by reference. During the Blackout Period and for a period of two years after the ending date of the Blackout

Period, security holders or other interested persons may obtain, without charge, information about the actual beginning and

ending dates of the Blackout Period and other information regarding the Blackout Period by contacting FMC’s Executive Vice

President, General Counsel and Secretary, by telephone at (215) 299-6000, or in writing at FMC Corporation, 2929 Walnut

Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.
