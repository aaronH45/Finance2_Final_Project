Item 8.01 Other Events

On February 17, 2022, Ryder System, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “ASR Agreement”) with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”) to repurchase approximately $300 million of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”).

Under the ASR Agreement, the Company will make an aggregate payment of $300 million to Morgan Stanley and will receive an aggregate initial number of approximately 3.1 million shares of Common Stock from Morgan Stanley. The specific number of shares that the Company ultimately will repurchase under the ASR Agreement will be based generally on the average of the daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Common Stock during a repurchase period, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreement. At settlement, Morgan Stanley may be required to deliver additional shares of Common Stock to the Company, or the Company may be required either to make cash payments or deliver shares of Common Stock to Morgan Stanley, at the Company’s election. The ASR Agreement contains customary provisions for agreements of this type, including provisions for adjustments to the transaction terms, the circumstances under which the ASR Agreement may be accelerated, extended or terminated, and various representations and warranties made by the parties to one another. The transaction is expected to be completed no later than the end of October 2022.
