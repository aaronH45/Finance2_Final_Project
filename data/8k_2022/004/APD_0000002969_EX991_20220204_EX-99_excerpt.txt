LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (February 4, 2022) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported first quarter fiscal 2022 results, including GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $2.52, up 19 percent over prior year, and GAAP net income of $550 million, up 13 percent over prior year as higher volumes, pricing and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. GAAP net income margin of 18.4 percent decreased 210 basis points, primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through, which negatively impacted margin by about 200 basis points. 

For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.52 increased 19 percent over the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA of $1,003 million was up eight percent over the prior year as higher volumes, pricing and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.5 percent decreased 570 basis points, primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through, which negatively impacted margin by about 450 basis points.

First quarter sales of $3.0 billion increased 26 percent over the prior year, on 14 percent higher energy cost pass-through, eight percent higher volumes and five percent higher pricing, partially offset by one percent unfavorable currency. Volume growth was driven by new assets, hydrogen and merchant recovery, and higher equipment sales. Pricing improved in the Americas, Asia and Europe—the Company's three largest segments—and in most major product lines. 

Air Products closed on Phase I of the $12 billion Jazan joint venture in late October 2021, which favorably contributed to results this quarter. On an ongoing basis, the benefit is seen in equity affiliate income and non-operating income. Q1 FY22 also saw a one-time benefit in equity affiliate income and non-controlling interest from the transfer of the Jazan air separation unit (ASU) assets and the settlement of the ASU JV. 

Commenting on the results, Air Products' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Seifi Ghasemi said, "With our secure business model, strong cash flows, and the continued hard work and dedication of the Air Products team around the world, we again performed in keeping with our commitments to our shareholders. The team delivered these results despite unprecedented energy cost increases, supply chain disruptions and the continuing pandemic. At the end of October, we also closed on Phase I of the Jazan project―the largest in our company’s history―which will create value for many years to come. As we continue to deploy capital into megaprojects that provide lower-carbon forms of energy and improve sustainability, we also remain committed to return cash to shareholders through our dividend, which we proudly increased for the 40th consecutive year."

Fiscal First Quarter Results by Business Segment

•Americas sales of $1,224 million were up 31 percent over the prior year on 20 percent higher energy cost pass-through; eight percent higher volumes, driven primarily by hydrogen and merchant demand; and three percent higher pricing. Operating income of $267 million increased 18 percent as higher volumes and pricing more than offset higher energy costs. Adjusted EBITDA of $457 million increased 14 percent on these same factors as well as higher equity affiliate income. Operating margin of 21.8 percent decreased 240 basis points, as higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted margin by about 350 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.3 percent decreased 560 basis points, as higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted margin by about 700 basis points.

•Asia sales of $780 million increased nine percent over the prior year on four percent higher volumes, particularly on-site volume from new plants across the region; three percent higher pricing; and two percent favorable currency. Operating income of $221 million increased three percent and adjusted EBITDA of $339 million increased two percent, as favorable volumes, pricing and currency more than offset higher costs. Operating margin of 28.3 percent decreased 160 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.4 percent decreased 280 basis points, as favorable volumes were more than offset by higher costs.

•Europe sales of $744 million increased 37 percent over the prior year on 27 percent higher energy cost pass-through; nine percent higher pricing; and five percent higher volumes, driven primarily by hydrogen and merchant demand, partially offset by four percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $99 million decreased 28 percent and adjusted EBITDA of $163 million decreased 19 percent, primarily driven by higher energy and other costs, partially offset by higher pricing. Operating margin of 13.3 percent decreased 1,200 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.9 percent decreased 1,520 basis points, predominantly on the higher energy costs; about half of the decline was due to energy cost pass-through.

•Middle East and India equity affiliate income of $92 million was up $71 million over the prior year, primarily from the Jazan joint ventures.

Outlook

Air Products continues to expect full-year fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $10.20 to $10.40, up 13 to 15 percent over prior year adjusted EPS. For the fiscal 2022 second quarter, Air Products' adjusted EPS guidance is $2.30 to $2.40, up 11 to 15 percent over fiscal 2021 second quarter adjusted EPS. 

Air Products expects capital expenditures of $4.5 to $5.0 billion for full-year fiscal 2022. 

Management has provided adjusted EPS guidance on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the impact of certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance, such as the incurrence of additional costs for cost reduction actions and impairment charges, or the recognition of gains or losses on disclosed items. It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to predict the timing or occurrence of these events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS or the effective tax rate. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify the potential significance of these events in advance, but any of these events, if they were to occur, could have a significant effect on our future GAAP EPS. Management therefore is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable effort, the Company’s forecasted range of adjusted EPS and effective tax rate to a comparable GAAP range.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

(Millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for per share data)

We present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), on an "adjusted" or "non-GAAP" basis. On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or "non-GAAP adjustments," have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of our business because such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. 

In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. 

When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.

ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS

There were no non-GAAP adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 or 2021 that impacted diluted EPS.

When applicable, the table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance.

ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN

We define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance. Margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding. 

The tables below present consolidated sales and a reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to adjusted EBITDA and net income margin on a GAAP basis to adjusted EBITDA margin:

ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. There were no non-GAAP adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal years 2022 or 2021 that impacted our effective tax rate.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

We define capital expenditures as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. A reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our reported capital expenditures is provided below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(A)In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates of $1.6 billion included approximately $130 from a non-controlling partner in one of our subsidiaries for the initial investment in the Jazan gasification and power project.

We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 to be approximately $4.5 to $5 billion.

It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.

OUTLOOK

The guidance provided below is on an adjusted continuing operations basis and is compared to adjusted historical diluted EPS. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance, such as the incurrence of additional costs for cost reduction actions and impairment charges, or the recognition of gains or losses on disclosed items. It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to identify the timing or occurrence of these events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify the potential significance of these events in advance, but any of these events, if they were to occur, could have a significant effect on our future GAAP EPS. Accordingly, management is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable efforts, the Company’s forecasted range of adjusted EPS on a continuing operations basis to a comparable GAAP range. The per share impact for each non-GAAP adjustment was calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.
