Management Commentary

Rob Sharps, chief executive officer and president, commented, “2021 began with optimism and expectations for a return to normality, but it ended up being a most unusual year. As the year progressed, broad-based enthusiasm gave way to a selective narrowing of the market as concerns grew over the emergence of new variants of COVID, rising inflation, and less accommodative monetary policy.

“Our investment performance remains strong over 5- and 10-year periods, but it was a difficult year for many of our active U.S. equity strategies given the narrow concentration of returns. In contrast, our positioning in credit and short-duration strategies drove improved performance in fixed income. We are also pleased with a strong year for performance in our flagship retirement date products. 

“Strong revenue growth of 13.2% for the quarter and 23.6% for the year was driven by market appreciation boosting average AUM. We continued to invest in strategic initiatives, but spending lagged revenue growth resulting in record profitability and diluted GAAP EPS of $13.12 and adjusted non-GAAP EPS of $12.75 for the year. In the fourth quarter we bought back over 3 million shares, which, combined with prior quarters’ repurchases, our regular dividend, and a special dividend earlier in the year, returned $2.8 billion to stockholders in 2021. In addition to capital return, we used $2.5 billion in cash to fund part of the acquisition of OHA. Still, our balance sheet remains strong with over $2 billion in cash and discretionary investments at year end.

“It was a challenging year for net flows with redemptions concentrated in U.S. equity growth portfolios, partly driven by client rebalancing after a period of robust returns. Gross sales remained strong, but elevated equity redemptions drove outflows of $22.7 billion in Q4 and $28.5 billion for 2021. Our multi-asset products returned to net inflows in 2021, and we continued to post positive net flows in fixed income, both of which partially offset the equity outflows. From a geographic perspective, we continued to see positive net flows in the Asia Pacific region, Canada, and EMEA intermediary channel.

"While we expect flows to improve from Q4, each of the flow trends we experienced throughout the past year has continued into 2022. As such, we forecast that net flows for 2022 will be below our long-term 1% to 3% growth target. Over time, we expect net flows to return to positive territory as we continue to pursue strategic initiatives to expand our investment capabilities, broaden our distribution reach, and deepen our client partnerships to support long-term growth. Highlights from Q4 included:

•In December we closed on the acquisition of OHA, a $57 billion alternative credit firm that will become our platform for private market alternative strategies. Both organizations value fundamental research and collaboration and have a strong focus on clients. Together we have significant opportunities to deliver long-term value for clients via existing and new investment strategies.

•We launched the Global Impact Credit strategy, initially as an OEIC in the U.K. with plans to expand this to additional vehicles. This new sustainable fixed income product joins our Global Impact Equity strategy, both of which have the dual goals of positive environmental or social impact and benchmark outperformance. 

2

•We entered an enhanced distribution relationship with Charles Schwab that will highlight our range of low-cost actively managed mutual funds, ensuring T. Rowe Price’s active management range is accessible to a broad array of advisors and retail investors.

“At the end of 2021, my predecessor, Bill Stromberg, retired as CEO after a distinguished 35-year career with the firm. Bill successfully led us through a challenging time for our industry. His legacy leaves us well positioned to take advantage of the significant opportunities ahead of us. I want to thank Bill for his immense contributions to our clients, our associates, and me personally, and for his continued impact going forward as non-executive chair of the Board.

“As we enter 2022, our focus on investment performance and outstanding client service remains our top priority. To deliver on these imperatives, we will continue to draw on our rich history and culture, while adapting to the changing landscape in our industry. I want to thank the 7,500 employees who work so hard for T. Rowe Price and our clients. We have an exciting future ahead.”

Assets Under Management

During Q4 2021, assets under management (AUM) increased $75.5 billion to $1.69 trillion. The acquisition of OHA completed on December 29, 2021 included $57 billion of capital under management(1), of which $46.9 billion of fee-basis AUM are reflected in the firm's AUM at December 31, 2021. Market appreciation also added $57.3 billion to the firm's AUM. These increases were partially offset by net cash outflows of $22.7 billion. Net cash outflows include the $2.5 billion the firm redeemed from its mutual fund holdings to fund the cash portion of the OHA acquisition. Clients transferred $5.4 billion in net assets from the U.S. mutual funds primarily to collective investment trusts and other investment products, of which $3.5 billion transferred into the retirement date trusts. The components of the change in assets under management, by vehicle and asset class, are shown in the tables below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) OHA's capital under management includes net assets value, portfolio value and/or unfunded capital.

(2) The underlying AUM of the multi-asset portfolios have been aggregated and presented in this category and not reported in the equity and fixed income columns.

(3) Includes distributions reinvested and not reinvested.

AUM in the firm's target date retirement products, which are reported as part of the multi-asset column in the table above, were $391.1 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $377.7 billion at September 30, 2021 and $332.2 billion at December 31, 2020. These portfolios experienced net cash outflows of $1.4 billion for Q4 2021 and net cash inflows of $11.3 billion for 2021.

Investors domiciled outside the United States accounted for 9.9% of the firm's assets under management at December 31, 2021, 8.8% at September 30, 2021, and 9.3% at December 31, 2020. The percentage at December 31, 2021 reflects the assets under management from OHA's clients outside the United States.

The firm provides participant accounting and plan administration for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the firm's U.S. mutual funds and collective investment trusts, as well as funds managed outside of the firm's complex. As of December 31, 2021, the firm's assets under administration were $270 billion, of which $163 billion are assets we manage. 

In recent years, the firm began offering non-discretionary advisory services through model delivery and multi-asset solutions for providers to implement. The firm records the revenue earned on these services in administrative fees. The assets under advisement in these portfolios, predominantly in the United States, were $8 billion at December 31, 2021.

Financial Results

Net revenues earned in Q4 2021 were nearly $2.0 billion, an increase of 13.2% from Q4 2020. Average assets under management in Q4 2021 were $1.65 trillion, an increase of 18.6% from Q4 2020. The firm voluntarily waived money market advisory fees in Q4 2021 of $14.9 million to continue to maintain positive yields for investors. The firm anticipates that the waivers in Q1 2022 will be at a slightly lower level than Q4 2021, and the firm expects to continue to waive fees through at least the first half of 2022.

▪Investment advisory revenues earned in Q4 2021 from the firm's U.S. mutual funds were $1.1 billion, an increase of 11.4% from Q4 2020. Average assets under management in these funds increased 16.4% to $882.2 billion in Q4 2021 from Q4 2020.

▪Investment advisory revenues earned in Q4 2021 from subadvised funds, separate accounts, collective investment trusts and other investment products were $694.0 million, an increase of 15.5% from Q4 2020. Average assets under management for these products increased 21.2% to $770.6 billion in Q4 2021 from Q4 2020.

▪The annualized effective fee rate of 43.4 basis points in Q4 2021 was down from 43.6 basis points earned in Q3 2021 and 45.7 basis points earned in Q4 2020. In comparison to Q4 2020, the annualized effective fee rate was impacted by the July 2021 target date fee reductions, client transfers to lower fee vehicles or share classes within the complex over the last twelve months, and lower performance fees. These fee pressures were partially offset as higher market valuations led to an asset class shift towards equity strategies. Over time, the firm's effective fee rate can be impacted by market or cash flow related shifts among asset and share classes, price changes in existing products, and asset level changes in products with tiered-fee structures.

▪Administrative, distribution, and servicing fees in Q4 2021 were $152.0 million, an increase of 16.3% from Q4 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher transfer agent servicing activities provided to the T. Rowe Price mutual funds.

Operating expenses in Q4 2021 were $1.1 billion, an increase of 12.5% compared to Q4 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, the firm's operating expenses in Q4 2021 were $1.0 billion, a 14.7% increase over Q4 2020. The firm's non-GAAP operating expenses exclude the impact of the supplemental savings plan, consolidated sponsored products, and transaction costs incurred related to the acquisition of OHA. 

The increase in the firm's non-GAAP operating expenses from Q4 2020 was primarily due to higher compensation costs; higher distribution and servicing costs as average assets under management increased over the prior year; and higher costs for technology development, associate transition, and core operations provided by FIS since August 2021 for the firm's full-service recordkeeping offering. The costs incurred from the FIS arrangement were partially offset by a reduction in the compensation expenses as a result of the approximately 800 associates who transitioned to FIS in August 2021. 

▪Compensation and related costs on a GAAP basis were $631.1 million in Q4 2021, a decrease of 1.5% compared to Q4 2020. Compensation and related costs, excluding the impact of the supplemental savings 

5

plan, were $607.7 million in Q4 2021, an increase of 5.9% compared to Q4 2020. This increase is primarily due to higher year-end compensation costs, and higher salaries and benefits. The firm's average staff size in Q4 2021 increased approximately 4% over prior year when excluding the impact of the transition of approximately 800 T. Rowe Price operations and technology associates to FIS on August 1, 2021, and the addition of OHA associates. The firm employed 7,529 associates (including 333 associates with OHA) at December 31, 2021, a decrease of 1.9% from the end of 2020. 

▪Distribution and servicing costs were $99.6 million in Q4 2021, an increase of 28.8% from 

the $77.3 million recognized in Q4 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher AUM-based distribution costs as a result of continued market appreciation and inflows in the firm's international products, including the Japanese Investment Trusts (ITMs) and SICAVs. These distribution costs, like those related to certain shares classes of the U.S. mutual funds, are offset entirely in net revenues. For the ITMs and SICAVs, the related revenue is recognized in investment advisory revenues. Higher costs incurred to distribute certain products through U.S. intermediaries also contributed to the increase.

▪Advertising and promotion expenses were $38.8 million in Q4 2021, an increase of 24.4% from Q4 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased media spend during the quarter.

▪Product and recordkeeping related expenses were $81.7 million in Q4 2021, an increase of 117.9% from Q4 2020. More than 90% of the increase was due to the costs incurred as part of the expanded FIS relationship, including certain nonrecurring transition expenses. While these transition expenses will not recur in 2022, the firm expects to incur certain technology-related costs as part of this expanded relationship with FIS over the next few years. These costs will be reported as technology, occupancy, and facility costs.

▪Technology, occupancy, and facility costs were $125.2 million in Q4 2021, an increase of 11.3% from Q4 2020. The increase was primarily due to the ongoing investment in the firm's technology capabilities, including hosted solution licenses and depreciation.

▪General, administrative, and other costs were $122.8 million in Q4 2021, an increase of 57.2% compared with the $78.1 million recognized in Q4 2020. Nearly 71% of the increase was related to the transaction costs incurred to complete the acquisition of OHA in Q4 2021. Higher information services and other administrative costs contributed to the remaining increase in Q4 2021 costs as compared to Q4 2020. 

The firm currently estimates its 2022 non-GAAP operating expenses, including a full-year of OHA's operating expenses, will grow in the range of 12% to 16%. Without consideration for OHA's operating expenses, the firm's 

6

2022 non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the range of 4% to 8%. The firm could elect to further adjust its expense growth should unforeseen circumstances arise, including significant market movements. Additionally, the firm currently expects that acquisition-related intangibles amortization, fair value adjustments of contingent consideration, acquisition-related retention compensation expense, and other acquisition-related expenses will be adjusted in determining non-GAAP operating expenses. 

Non-operating income. Non-operating income was $50.1 million in Q4 2021, as compared to non-operating income of $390.1 million in Q4 2020. The firm's consolidated products and the supplemental savings plan hedge portfolio comprised about 46% of the net gains recognized during Q4 2021. The cash and discretionary investment portfolio added net investment gains of $.2 million during Q4 2021. The components of non-operating income for Q4 2021 and Q4 2020 are included in the tables at the end of this release.

Income taxes. The following reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to the firm's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2021 and 2020:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) State income tax benefits are reflected in the total benefits for net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and stock-based compensation plans activity.

(2) Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest represents the portion of earnings held in the firm's consolidated investment products, which are not taxable to the firm despite being included in pre-tax income.

The firm's non-GAAP tax rate primarily adjusts for the impact of the consolidated investment products, including the net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests. The firm's non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.0% for Q4 2021 compared with 21.8% for Q4 2020 and 22.5% for the full year 2021 compared with 23.3% in 2020. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q4 2021 was favorably impacted by higher discrete tax benefits associated with the settlement of stock-based awards as compared to Q4 2020, partially offset by a higher state effective tax rate. For the full year 2021, the rate was favorably impacted primarily by higher discrete tax benefits associated with the settlement of stock-based awards as compared to 2020. 

The firm expects its effective state rate will be reduced to less than 3% in 2022 with the final year of the phased-in benefit of the 2018 Maryland state tax legislation.

The firm estimates that its effective tax rate for the full year 2022, on a GAAP basis, will be in the range of 22.0% to 25.0%.

Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation

The firm believes the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about its core operating results. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating the firm's core business, for comparing current results with prior period results, and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers. However, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies.

The following schedules reconcile U.S. GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2021.

The following schedules reconcile certain U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) These non-GAAP adjustments remove the impact that the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products have on the firm's U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, the firm adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products. The adjustment to operating expenses represents the operating expenses of the consolidated products, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to T. Rowe Price represents the net income of the consolidated products, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. Management believes the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products may impact the reader’s ability to understand the firm's core operating results.

(2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense impact from market valuation changes in the supplemental savings plan liability and the related net gains (losses) on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by participants. The firm uses T. Rowe Price investment products to economically hedge the exposure to these market movements. Management believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income (loss) realized on the economic hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and to increase comparability period to period.

(3) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the transactions costs incurred related to the acquisition of OHA. Management believes adjusting for these charges helps the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and to increase comparability period to period.

(4) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the other non-operating income (loss) and the net gains (losses) earned on the firm's non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the supplemental savings plan liability, and that are not part of the cash and discretionary investment portfolio. Management retains the investment gains recognized on the non-consolidated cash and discretionary investments as these assets and related income (loss) are considered part of the firm's core operations. Management believes adjusting for these non-operating income (loss) items helps the reader’s ability to understand the firm's core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, management does not emphasize the impact of the portion of non-operating income (loss) removed when managing and evaluating the firm's performance.

(5) The income tax impacts were calculated in order to achieve an overall year-to-date non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.5% for 2021 and 23.3% for 2020. As such, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 20.0% and 21.8%, respectively. The firm estimates that its effective tax rate for the full-year 2022 on a non-GAAP basis will be in the range of 23.0% to 25.0%.

(6) This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution. The calculation of adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders is as follows:
