        "(1)Information related to the amounts included from merger with N&B was received directly from DuPont and management believes such information is reliable. DuPont has not provided the underlying adjustments for the amounts included, but based on management's review of financial statement and other scheduled information provided, we believe the amounts reflected are reasonable. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2020, amounts include N&B results for October through December and February through December, respectively, to reflect the same period N&B is included in IFF results in 2021."
