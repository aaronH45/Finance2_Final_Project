Excludes lease liabilities relating to both finance and operating leases 2. The 2021 maturity reflects the $240,000,000 in principal outstanding on our unsecured commercial paper program as of as of September 30, 2021. The unsecured revolving credit facility is comprised of a $1,000,000,000 tranche that matures on June 4, 2023 (none outstanding at September 30, 2021) and a $3,000,000,000 tranche that matures on June 4, 2025 ($51,000,000 outstanding at September 30, 2021). Both tranches may be extended for two successive terms of six month at our option. These borrowings reduce the available borrowing capacity of our unsecured revolving credit facility to $3,709,000,000 as of September 30, 2021. If the commercial paper was refinanced using the unsecured revolving credit facility, the weighted average years to maturity of our combined debt would be 7.2 years with extensions. 3. 2023 includes a $500,000,000 unsecured term loan and a CAD $250,000,000 unsecured term loan (approximately $197,270,000 USD at September 30, 2021). The loans mature on July 19, 2023. The interest rates on the loans are LIBOR + 0.9% for USD and CDOR + 0.9% for CAD. 46 

Supplemental Financial Measures 47 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures We believe that revenues, net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ( NICS ), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ), are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider Funds from Operations (“FFO”), Normalized FFO, Net Operating Income ( NOI ), In-Place NOI ( IPNOI ), Same Store NOI ( SSNOI ), REVPOR and Same Store REVPOR ( SS REVPOR ), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Excluding EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA these supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis. Pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners’ noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts. We do not control unconsolidated investments. While we consider pro rata disclosures useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution. Our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. None of the supplemental reporting measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Multi-period amounts may not equal the sum of the individual quarterly amounts due to rounding. 48

(2) Includes estimated gains on expected dispositions. 49 

NOI, IPNOI, SSNOI, REVPOR & SS REVPOR We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations and transaction costs. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. IPNOI represents NOI excluding interest income, other income and non-IPNOI and adjusted for timing of current quarter portfolio changes such as acquisitions, development conversions, segment transitions, dispositions and investments held for sale. SSNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. Land parcels, loans and sub-leases as well as any properties acquired, developed/redeveloped (including major refurbishments where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more), sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts. Properties undergoing operator and/or segment transitions (except Seniors Housing Triple-net to Seniors Housing Operating with the same operator) are also excluded from same store amounts. Normalizers include adjustments that in management’s opinion are appropriate in considering SSNOI, a supplemental, non-GAAP performance measure. None of these adjustments, which may increase or decrease SSNOI, are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant normalizers (defined as any that individually exceed 0.50% of SSNOI growth per property type) are separately disclosed and explained in the relevant supplemental reporting package. REVPOR represents the average revenues generated per occupied room per month at our seniors housing operating properties. It is calculated as our pro rata version of total resident fees and services revenues from the income statement divided by average monthly occupied room days. SS REVPOR is used to evaluate the REVPOR performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio. It is based on the same pool of properties used for SSNOI and includes any revenue normalizations used for SSNOI. We use REVPOR and SS REVPOR to evaluate the revenue-generating capacity and profit potential of its seniors housing operating portfolio independent of fluctuating occupancy rates. They are also used in comparison against industry and competitor statistics, if known, to evaluate the quality of our seniors housing operating portfolio. We believe NOI, IPNOI, SSNOI, REVPOR and SS REVPOR provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use these metrics to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties. 50

(2) Represents minority partner's interest in joint ventures where Welltower is the majority partner and includes an adjustment to remove NOI related to a leasehold portfolio interest for 26 properties assumed by a wholly-owned affiliate in conjunction with the Holiday Retirement transaction. Subsequent to the initial transaction, we purchased eight of the leased properties and one of the properties was sold by the landlord and removed from the lease. No rent will be paid in excess of net cash flows relating to the leasehold properties. (3) Primarily represents non-cash NOI. (4) Represents timing adjustments for current quarter acquisitions, construction conversions and segment or operator transitions. 51 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 1031 deposits. We expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. The ratios are based on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as earnings (net income per income statement) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding unconsolidated entities and including adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, gains/losses/impairments on properties, gains/losses on derivatives and financial instruments, other expenses, additional other income and other impairment charges. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, along with net income, are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. Our leverage ratios include net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. Net debt is defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and any IRC Section 1031 deposits. 52
