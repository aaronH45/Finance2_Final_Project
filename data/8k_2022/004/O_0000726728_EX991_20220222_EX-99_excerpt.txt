CEO Comments

“2021 was a milestone year and I am deeply appreciative of our talented 'One Team' and all that we have accomplished,” said Sumit Roy, Realty Income's President and Chief Executive Officer. “In addition to closing our merger with VEREIT, we expanded our global platform through our investment in Spain, a new growth vertical in Continental Europe. To that end, we invested a record $2.6 billion in high-quality real estate during the fourth quarter. This brings 2021 property-level acquisitions to $6.4 billion, setting an annual record for the company. Our core business remains healthy as portfolio occupancy ended the year at 98.5% and our balance sheet remains well-positioned to capitalize on a robust global investment pipeline in 2022.”

Select Financial Results

The following summarizes our select financial results (dollars in millions, except per share data):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The calculation to determine net income attributable to common stockholders includes provisions for impairment, gains on sales of real estate, and foreign currency gains and losses. These items can vary from quarter to quarter and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders and period to period comparisons.

(2) Our financial results during the year ended December 31, 2021 were primarily impacted by the following transactions: (i) a $97.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which primarily includes $46.5 million related to the January 2021 early redemption of the 3.250% notes due October 2022 recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and $46.4 million related to the December 2021 early redemption of the 4.650% notes due August 2023 recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2021, (ii) $167.4 million of merger and integration-related costs related to our merger with VEREIT and spin-off of office properties to Orion Office REIT Inc., of which $137.3 million related to the three months ended December 31, 2021, (iii) $39.0 million of provisions for impairment, of which $8.0 million related to the three months ended December 31, 2021, and (iv) $14.7 million in reserves, net of reserve reversals, recorded as a reduction of rental revenue, of which $827,000 related to the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Rent Collections Update

Percentages of Contractual Rent Collected as of December 31, 2021

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Collection rates are calculated as the aggregate contractual rent collected for the applicable period from the beginning of that applicable period through December 31, 2021, divided by the contractual rent charged for the applicable period. Rent collection percentages are calculated based on contractual rent (excluding percentage rents and contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients). Charged amounts have not been adjusted for any COVID-19 related rent relief granted and include contractual rent from any clients in bankruptcy. Due to differences in applicable foreign currency conversion rates and rent conventions, the percentages above may differ from percentages calculated utilizing our total portfolio annualized contractual rent.

(2) We define our top 20 clients as our 20 largest clients based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent as of December 31, 2021 for all periods.

(3) Please see the Glossary in the Supplemental Operating and Financial Data for the three months ended December 31, 2021 for our definition of investment grade clients.

We either have executed deferral agreements or maintain ongoing deferral discussions with clients that account for a majority of the unpaid contractual rent for each of the periods referenced in the table above.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Initial weighted average cash lease yield is a supplemental operating measure. Please see the Glossary in the Supplemental Operating and Financial Data for the three months ended December 31, 2021 for our definition of this metric. Contractual net operating income used in the calculation of initial weighted average cash lease yield includes approximately $5.3 million received as settlement credits for six properties as reimbursement of free rent periods for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and approximately $8.5 million received as settlement credits for 41 properties as reimbursement of free rent periods for the year ended December 31, 2021.

(2) The three months and year ended December 31, 2021 includes £2.3 million and £7.0 million, respectfully, of investments in U.K. development properties, converted at the applicable exchange rates on the funding dates.

(3) Our clients occupying the new properties are 88.6% retail and 11.4% industrial, based on rental revenue. Approximately 35% of the rental revenue generated from acquisitions during the three months ended December 31, 2021 is from our investment grade rated clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies.

(4) Our clients occupying the new properties are 83.6% retail and 16.4% industrial, based on rental revenue. Approximately 40% of the rental revenue generated from acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021 is from our investment grade rated clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies.

Same Store Rental Revenue 

The following summarizes our same store rental revenue on 6,046 properties under lease (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For purposes of comparability, same store rental revenue is presented on a constant currency basis using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2021 of 1.35 GBP/USD. None of the properties in Spain met our same store pool definition for the periods presented. In addition, the same store pool excludes properties assumed on November 1, 2021 as a result of our merger with VEREIT.

Our calculation of same store rental revenue includes rent deferred for future payment as a result of lease concessions we granted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and recognized under the practical expedient provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Same store rental income was impacted by (reserve reversals) and reserves to rental revenue of $(5.6) million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $11.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, and $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our calculation of same store rental revenue also includes uncollected rent for which we have not granted a lease concession. If these applicable amounts of rent deferrals and uncollected rent were excluded from our calculation of same store rental revenue, the increases for the three months and year ended December 31, 2021 relative to the comparable periods for 2020 would have been 11.5% and 7.7%, respectively.

Combined, the new issues of the January 2027 Notes and the January 2042 Notes have a weighted average term of approximately 12.5 years and a weighted average effective semi-annual yield to maturity of approximately 2.28%. 

Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program

We have a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, with an initial term that expires in March 2023 (subject to two six-month options to extend).

Additionally, we have a U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured commercial paper program. Under the terms of this program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $1.0 billion, with proceeds used for general corporate purposes. We use our unsecured revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of the notes issued under this program. As of December 31, 2021, we had $901.4 million in commercial paper borrowings. 

Early Redemption of 4.650% Notes Due 2023 

In December 2021, we completed the early redemption on all $750.0 million in principal amount of our outstanding 4.650% notes due August 2023, plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of the early redemption, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $46.4 million, or $0.09 per diluted common share, to net income available to common stockholders, Nareit-defined FFO and Normalized FFO in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Loss on extinguishment of debt is excluded in our calculation of AFFO.

Completion of Exchange Offers

In connection with our merger with VEREIT, in November 2021, we completed our debt exchange offer to exchange outstanding notes issued by VEREIT's operating partnership, or VEREIT OP, totaling $4.65 billion in principal, for new notes issued by Realty Income, pursuant to which approximately 99.2% of the outstanding notes issued by VEREIT OP were exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of the notes issued by Realty Income.
