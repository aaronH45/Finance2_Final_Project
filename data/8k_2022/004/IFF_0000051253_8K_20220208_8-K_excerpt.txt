 Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   

On February 8, 2022, International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Carl C. Icahn and the persons and entities listed therein (collectively, the “Icahn Group”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to (i) increase the size of the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) to fourteen directors and (ii) appoint Barry Bruno (the “Independent Director”) to the Board to fill the resulting vacancy. In addition, the Company has agreed to include the Independent Director as part of the Company’s slate of nominees (collectively, the “2022 Slate”) for election to the Board at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2022 Annual Meeting”). 

In connection with his appointment to the Board, the Board determined that Mr. Bruno qualifies as an independent director under the listing rules of New York Stock Exchange. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Icahn Group agreed that it will not enter into any agreement with, or compensate, the Independent Director with respect to his role or service as a director of the Company. In addition, the Icahn Group confirmed that Mr. Bruno is not associated with the Icahn Group. 

In addition, under the terms of the Agreement, in the event the Independent Director resigns or for any reason fails to serve or is not serving as a director (subject to exceptions set forth in the Agreement, including as a result of such director not being nominated by the Company to stand for election at an annual meeting of stockholders subsequent to the 2022 Annual Meeting, following which the Icahn Group’s replacement rights shall terminate), then a new independent director that is mutually acceptable to the Board and the Icahn Group shall be added to the Board or as a nominee on the 2022 Slate, as applicable. 

So long as the Independent Director is a member of the Board, any Board consideration of appointment and employment of the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, mergers, acquisitions of material assets, dispositions of material assets, or similar extraordinary transactions, and voting with respect thereto, will take place only at the full Board level or in committees at which the Independent Director is a member. 

So long as the Icahn Group holds a “Net Long Position”, as defined in the Agreement, in at least 2,154,552 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Shares”), the Company will not adopt a Rights Plan, as defined in the Agreement, with an “Acquiring Person” beneficial ownership threshold below 15.0% of the then-outstanding Common Shares, unless (x) such Rights Plan provides that, if such Rights Plan is not ratified by the Company’s stockholders within 270 days of such Rights Plan being adopted, such Rights Plan shall automatically expire and (y) the “Acquiring Person” definition of such Rights Plan exempts the Icahn Group up to a beneficial ownership of 9.9% of the then-outstanding Common Shares. 

The Agreement also includes other customary voting, standstill and non-disparagement provisions. The Agreement, including the standstill restrictions on the Icahn Group, will terminate upon the earlier of (x) 35 calendar days before the advance notice deadline set forth in the bylaws of the Company (the “Bylaws”) for the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders and (y) the day that is the seventh calendar day after the Icahn Group gives written notice to the Company (which notice shall not be given before May 31, 2022) of the Icahn Group’s election to terminate the Agreement. 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. 

In connection with the entry into the Agreement, the Company and the Icahn Group will also enter into a Confidentiality Agreement, the form of which is included as Exhibit B to the Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. 

 Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

The description of the matters included under Item 1.02 are incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference. 

 Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

In connection with the entry into the Agreement, on February 8, 2022, the Board approved and adopted an amendment to Article II, Section 2 of the Bylaws, effective immediately, to increase the size of the Board to fourteen directors. 

The foregoing description of the amended Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. 

 Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
