IHS Markit Merger Update:  The Company continues to make progress on the merger with IHS Markit as the regulatory path to closing is now clear. The UK, EU, U.S. and Canadian regulators have now announced their views on the transaction. Based on the regulatory feedback, and the previously announced divestitures, we continue to anticipate closing this quarter.

Profit Margin: For the full year, the Company’s operating profit margin improved by 230 basis points to 50.9% and the adjusted operating profit margin improved by 190 basis points to 55.2% in 2021 primarily due to revenue gains and productivity improvements.

Return of Capital: The Company returned $743 million in dividends to shareholders in 2021. There were no share repurchases during the year due to the pending merger with IHS Markit.

Dividend: On January 26, 2022, the Board of Directors of S&P Global approved a dividend of $0.77 per share payable on March 10, 2022 to shareholders of record on February 10, 2022. Following the expected closing of the merger, the Board will revisit the dividend policy for the combined Company.

S&P Dow Jones Indices:

S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC is a majority-owned subsidiary. The consolidated results are included in S&P Global’s income statement and the portion related to the 27% noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 

Industry inflows into exchange-traded funds reached $1.2 trillion in 2021 with $879 billion going into equities and the remaining going into fixed income and commodity/other ETFs. During 2021, $287 billion of inflows went into ETFs associated with our indices. Year-end 2021 ETF AUM based on our indices increased 40% from year-end 2020 to $2.8 trillion as a result of both price appreciation and fund inflows. Market volatility was lower in 2021 than 2020 resulting in decreased revenue associated with exchange-traded derivatives. 

4th Quarter, 2021: Revenue increased 18% to $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue improved primarily due to increased asset-linked fees and exchange-traded derivatives. Average AUM in exchange-traded funds based on S&P DJI’s indices was $2.7 trillion in the quarter, an increase of 43% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Operating profit increased 22% to $199 million. Operating profit margin improved 220 basis points to 65.6% primarily due to revenue growth as well as restructuring expense and lease impairments incurred in the prior period. Operating profit attributable to the Company increased 23% to $145 million. Adjusted operating profit increased 13% to $199 million. Adjusted operating profit margin decreased 280 basis points to 65.7% due to unusually high expenses during the quarter. Adjusted operating profit attributable to the Company increased 11% to $145 million.

2021: Revenue increased 16% to $1,149 million and operating profit increased 20% to $798 million. Operating profit margin improved 210 basis points to 69.5%. Operating profit attributable to the Company increased 20% to $583 million. Adjusted operating profit increased 17% to $803 million.

Operating profit increased 24% to $575 million and operating profit margin increased 530 basis points to 58.1%. Adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $570 million and adjusted operating profit margin improved 300 basis points to 57.6% in the quarter.

Page 3

to $49 million due to increased incentive compensation, professional fees, and the timing of contributions to the S&P Global Foundation.

2021: This expense increased by 33% to $426 million primarily due to $249 million of expenses related to the pending IHS Markit merger. Adjusted Corporate Unallocated expense increased by 16% to $148 million.

Provision for Income Taxes: The Company’s effective tax rates in 2021 and 2020 were relatively unchanged at 21.6% and 21.5%, respectively. The adjusted effective tax rates in 2021 and 2020 were both 21.5%.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow: Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2021 were $6.5 billion. For full-year 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion. Free cash flow was $3.3 billion, an increase of $39 million from 2020. Free cash flow, excluding IHS Markit merger costs was $3.5 billion, an increase of $217 million over 2020. 

Outlook:  The Company will provide 2022 guidance for the combined company after the merger is completed. We continue to expect the merger to close this quarter. 

Comparison of Adjusted Information to U.S. GAAP Information: The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company also refers to and presents certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted net income, adjusted operating profit and margin, organic revenue, adjusted Corporate Unallocated expense, adjusted effective tax rates, adjusted diluted EPS guidance, free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items. The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP on Exhibits 5 and 7. Reconciliations of certain forward looking non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are not available due to the challenges and impracticability with estimating some of the items. The Company is not able to provide reconciliations of such forward looking non-GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Because of those challenges, reconciliations of such forward looking non-GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.

The Company’s non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that, in the case of non-GAAP financial measures other than free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items, enables investors to better compare the Company’s performance across periods, and management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its business, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management and that such measures are useful in evaluating the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and repurchase stock. However, investors should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports.
