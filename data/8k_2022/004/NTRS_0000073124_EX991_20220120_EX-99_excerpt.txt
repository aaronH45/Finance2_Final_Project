MICHAEL O’GRADY, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:

“Northern Trust’s performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 generated a 9% increase in revenue versus last year and a return on average common equity of 14.5%. Revenue growth reflected strong organic growth across each of our businesses, which also contributed to full year earnings growth and a return on average common equity of 13.9%. During the year we executed on our key growth initiatives and enhanced our foundational strength through advancements in our data and digital efforts, while also improving our productivity. The year also benefited from an improved outlook in projected economic conditions driving a release of reserves for credit losses. I want to commend the efforts of our employees around the world, whose commitment, expertise and professionalism in serving our clients and communities continue to be extraordinary. As we enter 2022, we remain focused on our long-term priorities and investing wisely for future profitable growth to deliver long-term value to our various stakeholders.”

RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT

The following table presents a reconciliation of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-generally accepted accounting financial measures. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
