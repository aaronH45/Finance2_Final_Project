"Our business delivered excellent performance in 2021, with strong underlying momentum driving total volume growth, high single-digit organic net revenue growth and double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth against the pandemic-affected prior year," said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer. 

"We were especially pleased by the reacceleration of our business in the fourth quarter to deliver better-than-expected results. This included a step-up in sequential IQOS user growth, as well as the outstanding initial performance of IQOS ILUMA. We also achieved essentially stable category share for cigarettes in the quarter, as our portfolio initiatives bore fruit and pandemic-linked restrictions receded in many markets."

"We enter 2022 with strong fundamentals, underpinned by IQOS, and exciting innovation to come across our broader smoke-free product portfolio. We are forecasting organic top-line growth of 4% to 6% and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8% to 11%, which prudently incorporate the continuing uncertainty on full IQOS device availability and the pace of the ongoing pandemic recovery."

2022 FULL-YEAR FORECAST

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Reported diluted EPS forecast to be in a range of $6.12 to $6.30, at prevailing exchange rates, versus reported diluted EPS of $5.83 in 2021. Excluding an unfavorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of around 

- 2 -

$0.45 per share, this forecast represents a projected increase of around 8% to 11% versus adjusted diluted EPS of $6.08 in 2021, as outlined in the above table.

2022 Full-Year Forecast Assumptions

This forecast assumes:

•Continuing uncertainty over the pace of the ongoing recovery from pandemic-related effects on the operating environment, notably in select geographies in PMI's South & Southeast Asia Region;

•An improving IQOS device supply situation, with a gradual return to an unconstrained IQOS user quarterly growth progression, albeit with a lack of full visibility over the year;

•A continued gradual improvement in PMI's duty-free business outside Asia, with no meaningful recovery in Asia;

•An estimated total international industry volume decline, excluding China and the U.S., of approximately -2% to -1%;

•A total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume percentage change for PMI of approximately -1% to +1%;

•Heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 113 to 118 billion units, including a carry-over effect from the temporary slowdown in IQOS user growth in the second half of 2021 (particularly the third quarter), which is estimated to be around four to five billion units;

•Adjusted net revenue growth of approximately 4% to 6% on an organic basis;

•An increase in adjusted operating income margin of 50 to 150 basis points on an organic basis, mainly driven by the continued favorable product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products, coupled with the benefit of further operating leverage and accelerated operating efficiencies. The assumed margin increase comes despite:

•the expectation of a moderately lower gross margin primarily due to temporary factors, such as:

◦the higher initial cost of IQOS ILUMA devices and initial weight and cost of TEREA consumables, which are expected to reduce over time, as with previous innovations;

◦higher logistics costs, including costs related to the use of air freight to support the strong up-take of IQOS ILUMA and TEREA consumables in Japan;

◦investments to grow capacity across PMI's smoke-free platforms; and

◦some inflation for certain supply chain elements;

•continued commercial reinvestment to support our growing portfolio of smoke-free alternatives;

•Other category net revenues of around $350 million (including smoking cessation products), with an operating loss of around $150 million, primarily due to:

•the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions;

•investments in research and development; and

•expenses related to employee retention programs;

•Operating cash flow of around $11 billion at prevailing exchange rates and subject to year-end working capital requirements;

- 3 -

•Capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, reflecting increased investments behind smoke-free platforms and PMI's digital commercial engine, in addition to certain projects which were delayed to 2022 due to the pandemic;

•An effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax events, of around 22%;

•The impact on diluted EPS of 2021 share repurchases; the impact of assumed 2022 share repurchases is not included in the forecast; and

•First-quarter reported diluted EPS in a range of $1.50 to $1.55, including an unfavorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of around $0.15 per share, notably reflecting: robust organic net revenue growth, as well as an unfavorable operating margin comparison primarily due to:

•the phasing of very strong gross productivity savings in 2021; and

•the factors described above for operating income margin for the full year.

This forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated or unquantifiable asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments pertaining to the judgment in the two Québec Class Action lawsuits and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) protection granted to PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), any unusual events, any intensification of the global shortage of semiconductors and the related impact on the supply of our electronic devices, and any COVID-19-related developments different from the assumptions set forth in the company's forecast.

Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.

IQOS in the U.S.

On November 29, 2021, an importation ban and cease-and-desist orders imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) relating to IQOS Platform 1 products (including consumables and infringing components) went into effect. As a result, IQOS is not currently available for sale in the U.S. PMI has appealed the patent and statutory issues related to the ITC's Final Determination, and also has contingency plans underway, including domestic production. PMI hopes to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. For more details on the ITC case and related legal matters, please refer to PMI's Form 10-K for 2021, which the company plans to file with the SEC in the coming days.

Note: The ITC decision has no bearing outside the U.S.; competitor lawsuits based on the same patent families have repeatedly and universally failed in European courts and the European Patent Office.

Platform 2

PMI conducted a consumer test of its Platform 2 TEEPS carbon tip product in the last quarter of 2021. As a result of the feedback from this consumer test, the design of the company's current Platform 2 technology has been discontinued. PMI is assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment.

Conference Call

A conference call, hosted by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer, will be webcast at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 10, 2022. Access is at www.pmi.com/2021Q4earnings.

OTHER

Following the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma A/S, OtiTopic, Inc. and Vectura Group plc., PMI added the "Other" category in the third quarter of 2021. Business operations for the Other category are managed and evaluated separately from the geographical operating segments.

Full-Year

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

PMI recorded net revenues of $101 million in the Other category, with approximately 39% of the total coming from Fertin Pharma's nicotine replacement therapy and nicotine-containing oral products businesses.

The operating loss of $52 million primarily reflected a pre-tax charge of $51 million in the third quarter of 2021 related to the OtiTopic transaction. The charge was recorded to research and development costs (within marketing, administration and research costs) and reflected PMI's accounting for the OtiTopic transaction as an asset acquisition, since the in-process research and development of the dry powder inhalation aspirin treatment represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired and had no alternative future use. The charge has been excluded from adjusted results.

PMI recorded an adjusted operating loss of $1 million for the Other category, which included the adverse impact of the amortization of intangibles and other acquisition-related costs.

Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future

Philip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long-term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, which are sold in markets outside the U.S. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the marketing of a version of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. As of December 31, 2021, PMI's smoke-free products are available for sale in 71 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 15.3 million adults around the world have already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life-sciences, in February 2021 PMI announced its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet patient and consumer needs.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.

PMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products in certain markets or countries; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco and other nicotine-containing products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use and intellectual property; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost, availability, and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials, as well as components and materials for our electronic devices; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to 

- 30 -

attract and retain the best global talent, including women or diverse candidates. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance.

In addition, PMI’s business risks also include risks and uncertainties related to PMI’s acquisitions of Fertin Pharma A/S (“Fertin”), OtiTopic, Inc. ("OtiTopic") and Vectura Group plc (“Vectura”), including, amongst other things: (1) the possibility that the integration of the operations of Fertin and Vectura with those of PMI may be more difficult and/or take longer than anticipated, and may not accelerate PMI’s desired entry into additional smoke-free and beyond nicotine platforms as quickly as anticipated; (2) the possibility that the respective integrations of Fertin and Vectura into PMI may be more costly than anticipated and may have unanticipated adverse results relating to Fertin, Vectura or PMI’s existing businesses; (3) the inability to gain access to or acquire differentiated proprietary assets, technology and/or pharmaceutical development expertise as anticipated by these acquisitions; (4) risks associated with third-party contracts containing consent and/or other contractual provisions that may be triggered by the acquisitions; (5) the success of the research and development efforts of Fertin, OtiTopic and Vectura, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for new products, and the ability to commercialize or license these new products; (6) any unanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns and the impact of identified concerns associated with the products developed by Fertin, OtiTopic and Vectura; and (7) the ability of PMI to retain key personnel of Fertin and Vectura, or hire key talent to work in the Fertin and Vectura businesses due to their affiliation with PMI.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant societal and economic disruption, and resulted in closures of stores, factories and offices, and restrictions on manufacturing, distribution and travel, all of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Currently, significant risks include our diminished ability to convert adult smokers to our reduced-risk products, significant volume declines in our duty-free business and certain other key markets, disruptions or delays in our manufacturing and supply chain, increased currency volatility, and delays in certain cost saving, transformation and restructuring initiatives. Our business could also be adversely impacted if key personnel or a significant number of employees or business partners become unavailable due to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic. The significant adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate could result in changes to the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands. Continuation of the pandemic could disrupt our access to the credit markets or increase our borrowing costs. Governments may temporarily be unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business. In addition, messaging about the potential negative impacts of the use of our products in relation to COVID-19 risks may lead to increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the sale and use of our products, negatively impact demand for our products, the willingness of adult consumers to switch to our reduced-risk products and our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products.

The impact of these risks also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, its recurrence in our key markets, actions taken to contain its spread and to mitigate its public health effects, and the ultimate economic consequences thereof.

PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, and PMI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021, which will be filed in the coming days. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.

Key Terms, Definitions and Explanatory Notes

•2020 and 2021 estimates for total industry volume and market share in certain geographies reflect limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data during pandemic-related restrictions.

•"Combustible products" is the term PMI uses to refer to cigarettes and OTP, combined.

•In-market sales, or "IMS," is defined as sales to the retail channel, depending on the market and distribution model.

•"Total shipment volume" is defined as the combined total of cigarette shipment volume and heated tobacco unit shipment volume.

•"Americas" refers to the former Latin America & Canada segment, which was renamed as the Americas segment as of the third quarter of 2021. References to "Americas" may, in defined instances, exclude the U.S.

•"North Africa" is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.

•"The GCC" (Gulf Cooperation Council) is defined as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

•"Southeast Europe" is defined as Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.

•Following the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma A/S, OtiTopic, Inc. and Vectura Group plc., PMI added the "Other" category in the third quarter of 2021. Business operations for the Other category are managed and evaluated separately from the geographical operating segments.

•Following the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH) on March 22, 2019, PMI continues to report the volume of brands sold by RBH for which other PMI subsidiaries are the trademark owner. These include HEETS, Next, Philip Morris and Rooftop.

•From time to time, PMI’s shipment volumes are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements, and estimated total industry/market volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of PMI’s competitors arising from market-specific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures. Such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain, shipment methods, consumer demand, timing of excise tax increases or other influences that may affect the timing of sales to customers. In such instances, in addition to reviewing PMI shipment volumes and certain estimated total industry/market volumes on a reported basis, management reviews these measures on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements. Management also believes that disclosing PMI shipment volumes and estimated total industry/market volumes in such circumstances on a basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements, such as on an IMS basis, improves the comparability of performance and trends for these measures over different reporting periods.

The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses. 

•"Cost/Other" in the Consolidated Financial Summary table of total PMI and the six geographical segments of this release reflects the currency-neutral variances of: cost of sales (excluding the volume/mix cost component); marketing, administration and research costs (including asset impairment and exit costs); and amortization of intangibles. “Cost/Other” also includes the currency-neutral net revenue variance, unrelated to volume/mix and price components, attributable to: fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets in the ME&A Region and the Saudi Arabia customs assessment net revenue adjustment.

•"Adjusted Operating Income Margin" is calculated as adjusted operating income, divided by adjusted net revenues.

•"Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, excluding asset impairment and exit costs, and unusual items.

•"Net debt" is defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents.

•Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral underlying results.

•Management reviews net revenues, operating income, operating income margin, operating cash flow and earnings per share, or "EPS," on an adjusted basis, which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, tax items and other special items. Currency-neutral and organic growth rates reflect the way management views underlying performance for these measures. PMI believes that such measures provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results. Management reviews these measures because they exclude changes in currency exchange rates and other factors that may distort underlying business trends, thereby improving the comparability of PMI’s business performance between reporting periods. Furthermore, PMI uses several of these measures in its management compensation program to promote internal fairness and a disciplined assessment of performance against company targets. PMI discloses these measures to enable investors to view the business through the eyes of management.

•Non-GAAP measures used in this release should neither be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, see the relevant schedules provided with this press release.

•U.S. GAAP Treatment of Argentina as a Highly Inflationary Economy. Following the categorization of Argentina by the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality as a country with a three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100%, the country is considered highly inflationary in accordance

with U.S. GAAP. Consequently, PMI began to account for the operations of its Argentinian affiliates as highly inflationary, and to treat the U.S. dollar as the functional currency of the affiliates, effective July 1, 2018.

•"Fair value adjustment for equity security investments" reflects the adjustment resulting from share price movements in passive investments for publicly traded entities that are not controlled or influenced by PMI. Under U.S. GAAP, such adjustments are required, since January 1, 2018, to be reflected directly in the income statement.

Reduced-Risk Products

•Reduced-risk products (“RRPs”) is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking. PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. PMI's RRPs are smoke-free products that contain and/or generate far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.

•"Heated tobacco units," or "HTUs," is the term PMI uses to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include the company's HEETS, HEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO (defined collectively as HEETS), Marlboro Dimensions, Marlboro HeatSticks, Parliament HeatSticks and TEREA, as well as the KT&G-licensed brands, Fiit and Miix (outside of South Korea).

•Market share for HTUs is defined as the total sales volume for HTUs as a percentage of the total estimated sales volume for cigarettes and HTUs.

•Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to PMI's Platform 1 IQOS devices and heated tobacco consumables.

•IQOS heat-not-burn devices are precisely controlled heating devices into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco units are inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.

•"PMI heat-not-burn products" include licensed KT&G heat-not-burn products.

•"PMI HTUs" include licensed KT&G HTUs.

•“Total IQOS users” is defined as the estimated number of Legal Age (minimum 18 years) users of PMI heat-not-burn products for which PMI HTUs represented at least 5% of their daily tobacco consumption over the past seven days.

The estimated number of adults who have "switched to IQOS and stopped smoking" reflects:

•for markets where there are no heat-not-burn products other than PMI heat-not-burn products: daily individual consumption of PMI HTUs represents the totality of their daily tobacco consumption in the past seven days; 

•for markets where PMI heat-not-burn products are among other heat-not-burn products: daily individual consumption of HTUs represents the totality of their daily tobacco consumption in the past seven days, of which at least 70% is PMI HTUs.

Note: The above IQOS user metrics reflect PMI estimates based on consumer claims and sample-based statistical assessments, the accuracy and reliability of which may vary based on individual market maturity and availability of information. The average margin of error for IQOS users in key volume markets is +/-5% at a 95% Confidence Interval.

As of December 2020, PMI heat-not-burn products and HTUs include licensed KT&G heat-not-burn products and HTUs, respectively.

IQOS in the United States

•On April 30, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the marketing of a version of PMI's Platform 1 product, namely, IQOS 2.4, together with its heated tobacco units (the term PMI uses to refer to heated tobacco consumables), is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the U.S. The FDA’s decision followed its comprehensive assessment of PMI’s premarket tobacco product applications (PMTAs) submitted to the Agency in 2017.

•In the third quarter of 2019, PMI brought IQOS 2.4 and three variants of its heated tobacco units to the U.S. through its license with Altria Group, Inc., whose subsidiary, Philip Morris USA Inc., is responsible for marketing the product and complying with the provisions set forth in the FDA's marketing orders.

•On July 7, 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of a version of PMI's Platform 1 product, namely, IQOS

2.4, together with its heated tobacco units, as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP). In doing so, the agency found that an IQOS exposure modification order is appropriate to promote the public health. The decision followed a review of the extensive scientific evidence package PMI submitted to the FDA in December 2016 to support its MRTP applications.

•On December 7, 2020, the FDA confirmed that the marketing of a version of PMI's Platform 1 product, namely, IQOS 3, is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the U.S. The FDA’s decision followed an assessment of a PMI's PMTA filed with the agency in March 2020.

•On November 29, 2021, an importation ban and cease-and-desist orders imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) relating to IQOS Platform 1 products (including consumables and infringing components) went into effect. As a result, IQOS is not currently available for sale in the U.S. PMI has appealed the patent and statutory issues related to the ITC's Final Determination, and also has contingency plans underway, including domestic production. PMI hopes to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. For more details on the ITC case and related legal matters, please refer to PMI's Form 10-K for 2021, which the company plans to file with the SEC in the coming days. Note: The ITC decision has no bearing outside the U.S.; competitor lawsuits based on the same patent families have repeatedly and universally failed in European courts and the European Patent Office.

•Shipment volume of heated tobacco units to the U.S. is included in the heated tobacco unit shipment volume of the Americas segment. Revenues from shipments of Platform 1 devices, heated tobacco units and accessories to Altria Group, Inc. for sale under license in the U.S. are included in Net Revenues of the Americas.
