Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to enable our growth strategies and strengthen our focus on customers. Our chemistries and supplies business and our remarketed instruments business will move from our Agilent CrossLab business segment to our life sciences and applied markets business segment. Service revenue and cost of sales related to the acquisition of BioTek will move from our life sciences and applied markets business segment to our Agilent CrossLab business segment. Following this reorganization, we will continue to have three business segments (life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab), each of which will continue to comprise a reportable segment. 

We are furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K to present selected segment information that reflect changes in our reportable segments related to the changes in our organizational structure. Beginning with the quarter ending January 31, 2022, our financial statements will reflect the new reporting structure with prior periods adjusted accordingly.
