FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Supplemental package contains “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by our use of the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “budgeted,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “guidance,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plans,” “projects,” “should,” “will” and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters. These statements are based on our current plans, expectations, projections and assumptions about future events. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond Boston Properties’ control. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statement. These factors include, without limitation, uncertainties and risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic domestically and internationally; federal, state and local government actions and restrictive measures implemented in response to COVID-19, the effectiveness of such measures and the effect of any relaxation or reimplementation of restrictions, and the direct and indirect impact of such measures on the U.S. and international economy and economic activity generally, the demand for office space and our tenants' businesses, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and liquidity; the emergence and characteristics of new variants, the speed, effectiveness and distribution of vaccines (including effectiveness against variant strains), whether new or existing actions or measures continue to impact the ability of our residential tenants to generate sufficient income to pay, or make them unwilling to pay rent in a timely manner, in full or at all; the health, continued service and availability of our personnel, including our key personnel and property management teams; and the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of government relief in providing assistance to individuals and large and small businesses, including our tenants, that have suffered significant adverse effects from COVID-19. In addition to the risks specific to COVID-19, other factors include, without limitation, the Company’s ability to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms, dependence on tenants’ financial condition, the uncertainties of real estate development, acquisition and disposition activity, the ability to effectively integrate acquisitions, the uncertainties of investing in new markets, the costs and availability of financing, the effectiveness of our interest rate hedging contracts, the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations, the effects of local, national and international economic and market conditions, the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and possible impairment charges on our operating results, the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on the Company’s accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results, regulatory changes and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of issuance of this report and are not guarantees of future results, performance or achievements. Boston Properties does not undertake a duty to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This Supplemental package includes non-GAAP financial measures, which are accompanied by what the Company considers the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Quantitative reconciliations of the differences between the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the non-GAAP financial measures presented are provided within this Supplemental package. Definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures and statements of the reasons why management believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors about the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and, if applicable, the other purposes for which management uses the measures, can be found in the Definitions section of this Supplemental starting on page 52.

The Company also presents “BXP’s Share” of certain of these measures, which are non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated as the consolidated amount calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus the Company’s share of the amount from the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the Company’s percentage ownership interest and, in some cases, after priority allocations), minus the Company’s partners’ share of the amount from the Company’s consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners’ percentage ownership interests and, in some cases, after income allocation to private REIT shareholders and their share of fees due to the Company). Management believes that presenting “BXP’s Share” of these measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and/or results of operations because the Company has several significant joint ventures and, in some cases, the Company exercises significant influence over, but does not control, the joint venture, in which case GAAP requires that the Company account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and the Company does not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes. In other cases, GAAP requires that the Company consolidate the venture even though the Company’s partner(s) owns a significant percentage interest. As a result, management believes that presenting BXP’s Share of various financial measures in this manner can help investors better understand the Company’s financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account its true economic interest in these joint ventures. The Company cautions investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating “BXP’s Share” of these measures may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture. For example, in addition to partners’ interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, financings and guarantees, liquidations and other matters. As a result, presentations of “BXP’s Share” of a financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to, the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Unless noted otherwise, reconciliations of “BXP’s Share” of these financial measures can be found in the Reconciliations section of this Supplemental package starting on page 56.

Q4 2021

Guidance and assumptions

GUIDANCE

The Company’s guidance for the first quarter 2022 and full year 2022 for diluted earnings per common share attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (EPS) and diluted funds from operations (FFO) per common share attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. is set forth and reconciled below. Except as described below, the estimates reflect management’s view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels, the timing of the lease-up of available space and the earnings impact of the events referenced in the Company’s earnings release issued on January 25, 2022 and those referenced during the Company’s conference call scheduled for January 26, 2022. Except as otherwise publicly disclosed, the estimates do not include any material (1) possible future gains or losses or the impact on operating results from other possible future property acquisitions or dispositions, (2) possible gains or losses from capital markets activity (including, without limitation, due to the early extinguishment of debt and resulting from hedging activity and derivatives), (3) possible future write-offs or reinstatement of accounts receivable and accrued rent balances or (4) possible future impairment charges. EPS estimates may be subject to fluctuations as a result of several factors, including changes in the recognition of depreciation and amortization expense, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and any gains or losses associated with disposition activity. The Company is not able to assess at this time the potential impact of these factors on projected EPS. By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on depreciable real estate, or gains and losses associated with disposition activities. For a complete definition of FFO and statements of the reasons why management believes it provides useful information to investors, see page 54. There can be no assurance that the Company’s actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_____________

1In light of the front-ended, uneven rental payments required by the Company’s 99-year ground and air rights lease for the 100 Clarendon Street garage and Back Bay Transit Station in Boston, MA, and to make period-to-period comparisons more meaningful to investors, the adjustment does not include the straight-line impact of approximately $52 and $144 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has remaining lease payments aggregating approximately $25.4 million, all of which it expects to incur by the end of 2023 with no payments thereafter. Under GAAP, the Company recognizes expense of $(87) per quarter on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. However, unlike more traditional ground and air rights leases, the timing and amounts of the rental payments by the Company correlate to the uneven timing and funding by the Company of capital expenditures related to improvements at Back Bay Transit Station. As a result, the amounts excluded from the adjustment each quarter through 2023 may vary significantly. 

2Consist of lease transaction costs that qualify as rent inducements in accordance with GAAP. Lease transaction costs are generally included in 2nd generation tenant improvements and leasing commissions in the Company’s FAD calculation on page 7.

________________

1Shady Grove Bio+Tech Campus is an approximately 435,000 net rentable square foot, seven-building office park situated on an approximately 31-acre site. The Company intends to reposition three of the buildings, which are currently vacant, to support life sciences uses. These three buildings are not part of the Company’s in-service portfolio and are included within Land Held for Future Development on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company anticipates it will redevelop or convert the remaining four buildings to lab or life sciences-related uses as each becomes vacant.

2The acquisition was completed through a newly formed joint venture with two institutional partners. Each partner owns approximately one-third of the joint venture. Each of the institutional partners invested approximately $71.9 million of cash for its ownership interest in the joint venture. The Company invested approximately $72.6 million in the joint venture and is providing customary operating, property management and leasing services to the venture. The purchase price was funded with cash and proceeds from a new mortgage loan secured by the property. 

3On December 14, 2021, the Company acquired 360 Park Avenue South. The gross purchase price was approximately $300.7 million (including $0.7 million of net closing costs), consisting of (1) the assumption of approximately $200.3 million of mortgage debt collateralized by the property and (2) the issuance of 866,503 common units of limited partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership (“OPUs”), the Company’s operating partnership. The OPUs issued totaled approximately $99.7 million based on the average closing price per share of BXP common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the closing date (approximately $115 per share). Following the acquisition, on December 14, 2021, the Company refinanced the mortgage loan with a new lender totaling $220.0 million. On December 15, 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture with two institutional partners as part of the Company’s Strategic Capital Program and contributed the property to the joint venture for its aggregate 42% ownership interest. There was no gain on sale of real estate associated with the contribution of the property to the joint venture. The joint venture has commenced redevelopment activity, including modernizing building systems and creating amenities, collaborative spaces, and client spaces. 

4Total percentage leased excludes 360 Park Avenue South, which is in redevelopment.

5Completed the sale of Annapolis Junction Buildings Six and Seven, two Class A office properties in Annapolis, Maryland totaling approximately 247,000 square feet, for a gross sales price of approximately $65.9 million. The Company had a 50% ownership interest in the joint venture that owned the properties. Net cash proceeds to the Company totaled approximately $17.6 million after repayment of the Company's share of debt totaling approximately $15.1 million. With the sale of Annapolis Junction Buildings Six and Seven, the Company no longer has any assets in Annapolis, Maryland. 

6The Company sold its 6595 Springfield Center Drive development project located in Springfield, Virginia on December 13, 2018. Concurrently with the sale, the Company agreed to act as development manager and guaranteed the completion of the project. The Company earned a development fee of approximately $7.9 million to develop this building. Upon completion of the project in 2021, the total cost of development was determined to be below the estimated total investment at the time of sale. As a result, the Company recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $8.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Q4 2021

Senior unsecured debt covenant compliance ratios

In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company’s Operating Partnership (Boston Properties Limited Partnership) received investment grade ratings on its senior unsecured debt securities and thereafter issued unsecured notes. The notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of December 13, 2002, by and between Boston Properties Limited Partnership and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented from time to time (the “Indenture”), which, among other things, requires us to comply with the following limitations on incurrence of debt: Limitation on Outstanding Debt; Limitation on Secured Debt; Ratio of Annualized Consolidated EBITDA to Annualized Interest Expense; and Maintenance of Unencumbered Assets. Compliance with these restrictive covenants requires us to apply specialized terms the meanings of which are described in detail in our filings with the SEC, and to calculate ratios in the manner prescribed by the Indenture. 

This section presents such ratios as of December 31, 2021 to show that the Company’s Operating Partnership was in compliance with the terms of the Indenture, which has been filed with the SEC. Management is not presenting these ratios for any other purpose or for any other period, and is not intending for these measures to otherwise provide information to investors about the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Investors should not rely on these measures other than for purposes of testing our compliance with the Indenture.

Q4 2021

Definitions

This section contains definitions of certain non-GAAP financial measures and other terms that the Company uses in this supplemental report and, if applicable, the reasons why management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors about the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and the other purposes for which management uses the measures. Additional detail can be found in the Company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as other documents the Company files or furnishes to the SEC from time to time. 

The Company also presents “BXP’s Share” of certain of these measures, which are non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated as the consolidated amount calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus the Company’s share of the amount from the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the Company’s percentage ownership interest and, in some cases, after priority allocations), minus the Company’s partners’ share of the amount from the Company’s consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners’ percentage ownership interests and, in some cases, after income allocation to private REIT shareholders and their share of fees due to the Company). Management believes that presenting “BXP’s Share” of these measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and/or results of operations because the Company has several significant joint ventures and, in some cases, the Company exercises significant influence over, but does not control, the joint venture, in which case GAAP requires that the Company account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and the Company does not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes. In other cases, GAAP requires that the Company consolidate the venture even though the Company’s partner(s) owns a significant percentage interest. As a result, management believes that presenting BXP’s Share of various financial measures in this manner can help investors better understand the Company’s financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account its true economic interest in these joint ventures. The Company cautions investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating “BXP’s Share” of these measures may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture. For example, in addition to partners’ interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, financings and guarantees, liquidations and other matters. As a result, presentations of “BXP’s Share” of a financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to, the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Unless noted otherwise, reconciliations of “BXP’s Share” of these financial measures can be found in the Reconciliations section of this Supplemental package starting on page 56. 

Annualized Rental Obligations

Annualized Rental Obligations is defined as monthly Rental Obligations, as of the last day of the reporting period, multiplied by twelve (12). 

Average Economic Occupancy

Average Economic Occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant units at their Market Rents, Average Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property’s total possible gross revenue. 

Average Monthly Rental Rates

Average Monthly Rental Rates are calculated by the Company as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (A) rental revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP by (B) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period. 

Average Physical Occupancy

Average Physical Occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage. 

Debt to Market Capitalization Ratio 

Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Market Capitalization Ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector that equals the quotient of (A) the Company’s Consolidated Debt divided by (B) the Company’s Consolidated Market Capitalization, presented as a percentage. Consolidated Market Capitalization is the sum of (x) the Company’s Consolidated Debt plus (y) the market value of the Company’s outstanding equity securities calculated using the closing price per share of common stock of the Company, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, multiplied by the sum of (1) outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, (2) outstanding common units of limited partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership (excluding common units held by the Company), (3) common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, (4) common units issuable upon conversion of 2012 OPP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units, (5) common units issuable upon conversion of 2013 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units, (6) common units issuable upon conversion of 2014 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units, (7) common units issuable upon conversion of 2015 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units, (8) common units issuable upon conversion of 2016 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units and (9) on and after February 6, 2020, which was the end of the performance period for 2017 MYLTIP Units and thus the date earned, common units issuable upon conversion of 2017 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units, (10) on and after February 5, 2021, which was the end of the performance period for 2018 MYLTIP Units and thus the date earned, common units issuable upon conversion of 2018 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units. The calculation of Consolidated Market Capitalization does not include LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned. Because their three-year performance periods have not yet ended, 2019, 2020 and 2021 MYLTIP Units are not included. 

The Company also presents BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization, which is calculated in a similar manner, except that BXP’s Share of Debt is utilized instead of the Company’s Consolidated Debt in both the numerator and the denominator. The Company presents these ratios because its degree of leverage could affect its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios. Investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of the Company, and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price and do not necessarily reflect the Company’s capacity to incur additional debt to finance its activities or its ability to manage its existing debt obligations. However, for a company like Boston Properties, Inc., whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness.

Q4 2021

Definitions (continued)

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre) 

Pursuant to the definition of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), the Company calculates EBITDAre as net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus preferred stock redemption charge, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, losses (gains) from early extinguishments of debt, depreciation and amortization expense, impairment loss and adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDAre from unconsolidated joint ventures less gains (losses) on sales of real estate. EBITDAre is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company uses EBITDAre internally as a performance measure and believes EBITDAre provides useful information to investors regarding its financial condition and results of operations at the corporate level because, when compared across periods, EBITDAre reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and acquisition and development activities on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net (loss) income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. 

In some cases the Company also presents (A) BXP’s Share of EBITDAre – cash, which is BXP’s Share of EBITDAre after eliminating the effects of straight-line rent (excluding the impact related to deferred revenue related to improvements to long-lived assets paid for by a tenant), fair value lease revenue, non-cash termination income adjustment (fair value lease amounts) and non-cash gains (losses) from early extinguishment of debt and adding straight-line ground rent expense (excluding prepaid ground rent expense), stock-based compensation expense and lease transaction costs that qualify as rent inducements, and (B) Annualized EBITDAre, which is EBITDAre for the applicable fiscal quarter ended multiplied by four (4). Presenting BXP’s Share of EBITDAre – cash allows investors to compare EBITDAre across periods without taking into account the effect of certain non-cash rental revenues, ground rent expense and stock based compensation expense. Similar to depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting, fair value lease revenue may distort operating performance measures at the property level. Additionally, presenting EBITDAre excluding the impact of straight-line rent provides investors with an alternative view of operating performance at the property level that more closely reflects rental revenue generated at the property level without regard to future contractual increases in rental rates. In addition, the Company’s management believes that the presentation of Annualized EBITDAre provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s results of operations because it enables investors to more easily compare quarterly EBITDAre to EBITDAre from full fiscal years. 

The Company’s computation of EBITDAre may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its operating results, EBITDAre should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. EBITDAre should not be considered a substitute to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio equals BXP’s Share of EBITDAre – cash divided by Total Fixed Charges. BXP’s Share of EBITDAre – cash is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to BXP’s Share of EBITDAre after eliminating the effects of straight-line rent (excluding the impact related to deferred revenue related to improvements to long-lived assets paid for by a tenant), fair value lease revenue, non-cash termination income adjustment (fair value lease amounts) and non-cash gains (losses) from early extinguishment of debt and adding straight-line ground rent expense, stock-based compensation expense and lease transaction costs that qualify as rent inducements. Total Fixed Charges is also a non-GAAP financial measure equal to the sum of BXP’s Share of interest expense, capitalized interest, maintenance capital expenditures, hotel improvements, equipment upgrades and replacements and preferred dividends/distributions less hedge amortization and amortization of financing costs. The Company believes that the presentation of its Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio provides investors with useful information about the Company’s financial performance as it relates to overall financial flexibility and balance sheet management. Furthermore, the Company believes that the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is frequently used by analysts, rating agencies and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company’s performance as a REIT and, as a result, by presenting the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio the Company assists these parties in their evaluations. The Company’s calculation of its Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may not be comparable to the ratios reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define the term differently and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For clarification purposes, this ratio does not include gains (losses) from early extinguishments of debt. 

Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) and FAD Payout Ratio

In addition to FFO, which is defined on the following page, the Company presents Funds Available for Distribution to common shareholders and common unitholders (FAD), which is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by (1) adding to FFO lease transaction costs that qualify as rent inducements, non-real estate depreciation, non-cash losses (gains) from early extinguishments of debt, stock-based compensation expense, partners’ share of consolidated and unconsolidated joint venture 2nd generation tenant improvement and leasing commissions (included in the period in which the lease commences) and unearned portion of capitalized fees, (2) eliminating the effects of straight-line rent, straight-line ground rent expense adjustment (excluding prepaid ground rent expense), hedge amortization and fair value lease revenue, and (3) subtracting maintenance capital expenditures, hotel improvements, equipment upgrades and replacements, 2nd generation tenant improvement and leasing commissions (included in the period in which the lease commences), non-cash termination income adjustment (fair value lease amounts) and impairments of non-depreciable real estate. The Company believes that the presentation of FAD provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s results of operations because FAD provides supplemental information regarding the Company’s operating performance that would not otherwise be available and may be useful to investors in assessing the Company’s operating performance. Additionally, although the Company does not consider FAD to be a liquidity measure, as it does not make adjustments to reflect changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period, the Company believes that FAD may provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s ability to generate cash from its operating performance and the impact of the Company’s operating performance on its ability to make distributions to its shareholders. Furthermore, the Company believes that FAD is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of its performance as a REIT and, as a result, by presenting FAD the Company is assisting these parties in their evaluation. FAD should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc.’s co determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

FAD Payout Ratio is defined as distributions to common shareholders and unitholders (excluding any special distributions) divided by FAD.

Funds from Operations (FFO)

Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of Nareit, the Company calculates Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on the Company’s balance sheet, impairment losses on its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, but the Company believes the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing the Company’s operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. 

The Company’s computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company’s operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

In-Service Properties

The Company treats a property as being “in-service” upon the earlier of (1) lease-up and completion of tenant improvements or (2) one year after cessation of major construction activity as determined under GAAP. The determination as to when an entire property should be treated as “in-service” involves a degree of judgment and is made by management based on the relevant facts and circumstances of the particular property. For portfolio operating and occupancy statistics, the Company specifies a single date for treating a property as “in-service,” which is generally later than the date the property is partially placed in-service under GAAP. Under GAAP, a property may be placed in-service in stages as construction is completed and the property is held available for occupancy. In addition, under GAAP, when a portion of a property has been substantially completed and either occupied or held available for occupancy, the Company ceases capitalizing costs on that portion, even though it may not treat the property as being “in-service,” and continues to capitalize only those costs associated with the portion still under construction. In-service properties include properties held by the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures. 

Interest Coverage Ratio

Interest Coverage Ratio, calculated including and excluding capitalized interest, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to BXP’s Share of EBITDAre – cash divided by Adjusted interest expense. BXP’s Share of EBITDAre – cash is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to BXP’s Share of EBITDAre after eliminating the effects of straight-line rent (excluding the impact related to deferred revenue related to improvements to long-lived assets paid for by a tenant), fair value lease revenue, non-cash termination income adjustment (fair value lease amounts) and non-cash gains (losses) from early extinguishment of debt and adding straight-line ground rent expense (excluding prepaid ground rent expense), stock-based compensation expense and lease transaction costs that qualify as rent inducements. Adjusted interest expense excluding capitalized interest is equal to BXP’s Share of interest expense less (1) BXP’s Share of hedge amortization and (2) BXP’s Share of amortization of financing costs. Adjusted interest expense including capitalized interest is calculated in the same manner but adds back BXP’s Share of capitalized interest. The Company believes that the presentation of its Interest Coverage Ratio provides useful information about the Company’s financial condition because it provides investors additional information on the Company’s ability to meet its debt obligations and incur additional indebtedness. In addition, by analyzing interest coverage ratios over a period of time, trends may emerge that provide investors a better sense of whether a company’s financial condition is improving or declining. The ratios may also be used to compare the financial condition of different companies, which can help when making an investment decision. The Company presents its Interest Coverage Ratio in two ways - including capitalized interest and excluding capitalized interest. GAAP requires the capitalization of interest expense during development. Therefore, for a company like Boston Properties, Inc. that is an active developer of real estate, presenting the Interest Coverage Ratio (excluding capitalized interest) provides an alternative measure of financial condition that may be more indicative of the Company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations and therefore its overall financial condition. For clarification purposes, this ratio does not include gains (losses) from early extinguishments of debt. 

Market Rents

Market Rents used by the Company in calculating Average Economic Occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of the Company’s residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property’s units and publicly available market data. Trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could therefore vary materially. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions. 

Net Debt

Net Debt is equal to (A) the Company’s consolidated debt plus special dividends payable (if any) less (B) cash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrow for potential Section 1031 like kind exchange(s). The Company believes that the presentation of Net Debt provides useful information to investors because the Company reviews Net Debt as part of the management of its overall financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage. In particular, Net Debt is an important component of the Company’s ratio of BXP’s Share of Net Debt to BXP’s Share of EBITDAre. BXP’s Share of Net Debt is calculated in a similar manner to Net Debt, except that BXP’s Share of Debt and BXP’s Share of cash are utilized instead of the Company’s consolidated debt and cash in the calculation. The Company believes BXP’s Share of Net Debt to BXP’s Share of EBITDAre is useful to investors because it provides an alternative measure of the Company’s financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage based on its percentage ownership interest in all of its assets. Furthermore, certain debt rating agencies, creditors and credit analysts monitor the Company’s Net Debt as part of their assessments of its business. The Company may utilize a considerable portion of its cash and cash equivalents at any given time for purposes other than debt reduction. In addition, cash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrow for potential Section 1031 like kind exchange(s) may not be solely controlled by the Company. The deduction of these items from consolidated debt in the calculation of Net Debt therefore should not be understood to mean that these items are available exclusively for debt reduction at any given time.

Net Operating Income/(Loss) (NOI)

Net operating income/(loss) (NOI) is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus (1) preferred stock redemption charge, preferred dividends, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, corporate general and administrative expense, payroll and related costs from management services contracts, transaction costs, impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense, losses from early extinguishments of debt and interest expense, less (2) development and management services revenue, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, gains (losses) on sales of real estate, gains (losses) from investments in securities and interest and other income (loss). In some cases, the Company also presents (1) NOI – cash, which is NOI after eliminating the effects of straight-line rent (excluding the impact related to deferred revenue related to improvements to long-lived assets paid for by a tenant), fair value lease revenue, straight-line ground rent expense adjustment (excluding prepaid ground rent), prepaid ground rent expense and lease transaction costs that qualify as rent inducements in accordance with GAAP, and (2) NOI and NOI – cash, in each case excluding termination income. 

The Company uses these measures internally as performance measures and believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the Company’s results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, they reflect the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. Similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). In addition, depreciation and amortization expense because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level. Presenting NOI – cash allows investors to compare NOI performance across periods without taking into account the effect of certain non-cash rental revenues and ground rent expenses. Similar to depreciation and amortization expense, fair value lease revenues, because of historical cost accounting, may distort operating performance measures at the property level. Additionally, presenting NOI excluding the impact of the straight-lining of rent provides investors with an alternative view of operating performance at the property level that more closely reflects net cash generated at the property level on an unleveraged basis. Presenting NOI measures that exclude termination income provides investors with additional information regarding operating performance at a property level that allows them to compare operating performance between periods without taking into account termination income, which can distort the results for any given period because they generally represent multiple months or years of a tenant’s rental obligations that are paid in a lump sum in connection with a negotiated early termination of the tenant’s lease and are not reflective of the core ongoing operating performance of the Company’s properties. 

Rental Obligations

Rental Obligations is defined as the contractual base rents (but excluding percentage rent) and budgeted reimbursements from tenants under existing leases. These amounts exclude rent abatements. 

Rental Revenue

Rental Revenue is equal to Total revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less development and management services revenue and direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts. The Company uses Rental Revenue internally as a performance measure and in calculating other non-GAAP financial measures (e.g., NOI), which provides investors with information regarding our performance that is not immediately apparent from the comparable non-GAAP measures and allows investors to compare operating performance between periods. The Company also presents Rental Revenue (excluding termination income) because termination income can distort the results for any given period because it generally represents multiple months or years of a tenant’s rental obligations that are paid in a lump sum in connection with a negotiated early termination of the tenant’s lease and does not reflect the core ongoing operating performance of the Company’s properties. 

Same Properties

In the Company’s analysis of NOI, particularly to make comparisons of NOI between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by the Company throughout each period presented. The Company refers to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by the Company through the end of the latest period presented as “Same Properties.” “Same Properties” therefore exclude properties placed in-service, acquired, repositioned or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Accordingly, it takes at least one year and one quarter after a property is acquired or treated as “in-service” for that property to be included in “Same Properties.” Pages 20 - 23 indicate by footnote the “In-Service Properties” that are not included in “Same Properties.”

1In light of the front-ended, uneven rental payments required by the Company’s 99-year ground and air rights lease for the 100 Clarendon Street garage and Back Bay Transit Station in Boston, MA, and to make period-to-period comparisons more meaningful to investors, the adjustment does not include the straight-line impact of approximately $40 and $98 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, the Company has remaining lease payments aggregating approximately $25.4 million, all of which it expects to incur by the end of 2023 with no payments thereafter. Under GAAP, the Company recognizes expense of $(87) per quarter on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. However, unlike more traditional ground and air rights leases, the timing and amounts of the rental payments by the Company correlate to the uneven timing and funding by the Company of capital expenditures related to improvements at Back Bay Transit Station. As a result, the amounts excluded from the adjustment each quarter through 2023 may vary significantly.
