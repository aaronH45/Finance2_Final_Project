Management Commentary

“We are pleased to have achieved another strong year for IFF, with continued growth in sales and profitability as we advanced our transformation strategy,” said IFF Chairman and CEO Andreas Fibig. “We finished the year ahead of our sales target, with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter driven by all business segments. I am also pleased that we achieved our synergy target and began optimizing our portfolio to create a more efficient organization and enhance value for our shareholders. I am confident that as IFF enters its next chapter, the Company will continue to deliver long-term profitable growth and provide significant benefits for all its stakeholders.” 

IFF Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter, commented, “Looking ahead, our teams are focused on pricing execution and cost discipline to improve our operational performance as well as furthering our integration and portfolio optimization efforts. These priorities are critical as we expect inflationary pressures across the supply chain to continue in 2022. We are taking significant pricing actions to fully offset our dollar cost exposure, which we expect will result in strong sales and profit growth at a more modest margin. Longer-term, we remain confident in our ability to recover margin to pre-inflation levels as we are focused on improving returns to generate strong value creation for our shareholders.”

Comparable currency neutral sales growth for 2022 is expected to be approximately 6% to 9%. On a comparable basis, full year 2021 sales were approximately $11.85 billion, including approximately $500 million related to N&B January 2021 sales, less approximately $300 million of sales related to the Fruit Preparation and pending Microbial Control divestitures. 

Comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth for 2022 is expected to be approximately 4% to 8%. On a comparable basis, full year 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA was approximately $2.5 billion, including approximately $110 million related to N&B January 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA, less approximately $35 million of adjusted operating EBITDA related to the Fruit Preparation and pending Microbial Control divestitures. 

The Company expects that foreign exchange will negatively impact sales growth in 2022 by approximately 2 percentage points and adjusted operating EBITDA growth by approximately 4 percentage points.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We provide in this press release non-GAAP financial measures, including: (i) combined currency neutral sales; (ii) adjusted operating EBITDA and combined adjusted operating EBITDA; (iii) adjusted EBITDA margin and combined adjusted operating EBITDA margin; (iv) adjusted EPS ex amortization; (v) free cash flow; and (vi) net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA.

Our non-GAAP financial measures are defined below.

Currency Neutral metrics eliminate the effects that result from translating non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars. We calculate currency neutral numbers by translating current year invoiced sale amounts at the exchange rates used for the corresponding prior year period. We use currency neutral results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance. We also use currency neutral numbers when analyzing our performance against our competitors.

Adjusted operating EBITDA and adjusted operating EBITDA margin exclude depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other income (expense), net, restructuring and other charges and certain non-recurring items such as Frutarom integration related costs, gain (losses) on sale of assets, shareholder activism related costs, business divestiture costs, employee separation costs, Frutarom acquisition related costs, compliance review & legal defense costs, N&B inventory step-up costs, N&B transaction related costs, N&B integration related costs and the impact of the merger with N&B.

Adjusted EPS ex Amortization excludes the impact of non-operational items including Frutarom integration related costs, restructuring and other charges, gain (losses) on sale of assets, , business divestiture costs, employee separation costs, pension settlement Frutarom acquisition related costs, compliance review and legal defense costs, , N&B transaction related costs, N&B integration related costs, redemption value adjustment to EPS, the impact of the merger with N&B and non-cash items including the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets.

Free Cash Flow is operating cash flow (i.e. cash flow from operations) less capital expenditures.

Net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA is the leverage ratio used in our credit agreement and defined as Net debt (which is long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents) divided by the trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA. Credit adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, specified items and non-cash items.

Combined historical results for the fourth quarter is defined as 3 months (October, November and December) of legacy IFF and N&B results, in both the 2020 period and the current 2021 period. Combined historical results for the full year is defined as 12 months of legacy IFF results, and 11 months (excluding January) of N&B results.

These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. These non-

6

GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ calculation of such metrics.

Effective in the first quarter of 2021, the Company elected to change the profit or loss measure of the Company's reportable segments from Segment Operating Profit to Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for internal reporting and performance measurement purposes. Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA is defined as (Loss) Income Before Taxes before depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, restructuring and other charges, net and certain non-recurring items. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect these changes in segment profitability measures. Our determination of reportable segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities within each segment and corresponds to the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment. In addition to our strategic priorities, segment reporting is also based on differences in the products and services we provide. As a result, we added two new reportable segments - Health & Biosciences and Pharma Solutions. Nourish is composed of IFF’s legacy Taste segment and N&B’s Food & Beverage segment. The Scent and Health & Biosciences segments include a component of the legacy Taste segment.

The Company cannot reconcile its expected Adjusted Operating EBITDA margin to Income (loss) Before Taxes under "Financial Guidance" without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. These items include but are not limited to Frutarom integration related costs, losses on sale of assets, shareholder activism related costs, business divestiture costs, employee separation costs, compliance review & legal defense costs, N&B inventory step-up costs, N&B transaction related costs and N&B integration related costs.
