Item 5.02Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On January 13, 2022, the Board of Directors (“Board”) of McKesson Corporation (“Company”) elected James H. Hinton and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson as directors of the Corporation effective on January 13, 2022.

Mr. Hinton serves as an operating partner for the private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stone. Prior to that, he held the role of chief executive officer at Baylor Scott & White Health, the largest not-for-profit health system in Texas, and held a variety of roles with Presbyterian Healthcare Services, New Mexico’s largest non-profit healthcare provider, including president and chief executive officer.

Ms. Wilson-Thompson most-recently held the role of executive vice president and global chief human resources officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance. Prior to that, she held the role of senior vice president of global human resource at Kellogg Company. She serves on the boards of directors of Tesla, Inc. and Wolverine Worldwide.

The Company expects that the Board will appoint Mr. Hinton to the Compliance Committee and Governance Committee and Ms. Wilson-Thompson to the Compensation Committee and Governance Committee.

Mr. Hinton and Ms. Wilson-Thompson each will receive compensation in accordance with the Company’s standard compensatory arrangement for non-employee directors. Each will receive an annual cash retainer of $80,000, which will be prorated based on their election date. Each also will receive, effective February 7, 2022, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the Company’s 2013 Stock Plan in an amount that represents the annual equity award value granted to non-management directors after the Company's 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, prorated to January 13, 2022. The number of RSUs to be granted to each will be determined by dividing $94,191.78 by the closing price of the Company's common stock on February 7, 2022.

In addition, effective January 13, 2022, Mr. Hinton and Ms. Wilson-Thompson each will enter into the Company’s standard Indemnification Agreement for directors, which provides for indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.
