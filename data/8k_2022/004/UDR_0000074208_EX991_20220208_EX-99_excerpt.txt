UDR ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2021 RESULTS

AND 2022 GUIDANCE RANGES

UDR, Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE: UDR), announced today its fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results. Net Income, Funds from Operations (“FFO”), FFO as Adjusted (“FFOA”), and Adjusted FFO (“AFFO”) per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 are detailed below.

​

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

●The Company reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $116.4 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to $25.5 million, or $0.09 per share, in the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in Same-Store (“SS”) net operating income (“NOI”), higher NOI from acquired communities, higher income from unconsolidated entities particularly from real estate technology investments, higher gains on sold properties, and lower debt extinguishment costs.

​

●SS results for fourth quarter 2021 versus fourth quarter 2020 and third quarter 2021 are summarized below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

●The Company’s weighted average SS physical occupancy for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 97.1 percent, compared to 96.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 97.5 percent for the third quarter of 2021.

​

●The Company continues to implement its Next Generation Operating Platform which helped limit fourth quarter 2021 SS controllable expense growth to 2.8 percent YOY and 2.2 percent YTD.

​

●During the quarter, the Company acquired three communities for an aggregate purchase price of $409.1 million and disposed of one community for proceeds of $126.0 million. Additionally, the Company committed $52.2 million to a Developer Capital Program (“DCP”) investment.

“Our full-year 2021 earnings and same-store results compare very well versus initial guidance, and operating strength has persisted into 2022,” said Tom Toomey, UDR’s Chairman and CEO. “Our outlook for 2022 guidance signals one of our best years ever. In addition to favorable market rent growth dynamics, our unique value creation mechanisms, accretive capital allocation, and innovative Platform initiatives serve as a strong foundation for margin expansion and robust same-store, earnings, and dividend growth.”

Recent Operating Trends

“Pricing power remained unseasonably strong in the fourth quarter with blended lease rate growth in the low-teens and a low-double-digit loss-to-lease to start the year,” said Mike Lacy, UDR’s Senior Vice President of Operations. “When coupled with occupancy above 97 percent, continued elevated traffic levels, and the real-time demand data we are using to optimize unit-level pricing, we are set up well to achieve strong results as we enter 2022.”

Summary of Third Quarter 2021, Fourth Quarter 2021, and January 2022 Residential Operating Trends (1)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)

Metrics shown here are as of January 31, 2022, and are for the Company’s total residential portfolio, unless otherwise indicated. The summation of cash revenue collected during and subsequent to a billing period may not equate to the total cash revenue collected as of January 31, 2022 for that same billing period due to rounding. Cash revenue collected as a percentage of billed revenue for Q1 2021 and Q2 2021 continue to increase over time and are 98.1 percent, and 98.2 percent, respectively, as of January 31, 2022.

(2)

For Q4 2021, as a result of the Company’s additional cash revenue collected as a percentage of billed revenue attributable to prior quarters as outlined in footnote (1) above, the Company reduced its reserves (reflected as an increase in revenues) by approximately 0.5 percent, or $1.7 million, including $0.3 million for the Company’s share from unconsolidated joint ventures. This reduces the Company’s total bad debt reserve to $13.2 million, including $0.8 million for the Company’s share from unconsolidated joint ventures, which compares to a quarter-end accounts receivable balance of $23.4 million.

(3)

The Company defines Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth as the combined proportional growth as a result of (a) Effective New Lease Rate Growth and (b) Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth. Management considers Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth a useful metric for investors as it assesses combined proportional market-level new and in-place demand trends. Please refer to the “Definitions and Reconciliations” section of the Company’s related quarterly Supplemental Financial Information for additional details.

In September 2018, UDR structured a $12.9 million preferred equity investment with a third-party developer to finance this 330-apartment home community that was completed in 2020.
