First Quarter GAAP Diluted EPS of $2.13 and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $2.58

Adjusted Diluted EPS Guidance Range Raised to $10.60 to $10.90 for Fiscal 2022

CONSHOHOCKEN, PA, February 2, 2022 - AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE: ABC) today reported that in its fiscal year 2022 first quarter ended December 31, 2021, revenue increased 13.5 percent year-over-year to $59.6 billion. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $2.13 for the December quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to $1.81 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes items described below, increased 18.3 percent to $2.58 in the fiscal first quarter.

 AmerisourceBergen is updating its outlook for fiscal year 2022. The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, as discussed below in Fiscal Year 2022 Expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance has been raised from the previous range of $10.50 to $10.80 to a range of $10.60 to $10.90.

"AmerisourceBergen continues to play an important role in supporting the COVID response, both in the U.S. and abroad," said Steven H. Collis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of AmerisourceBergen. "We are proud of the work our teams do in leveraging our capabilities and expertise to deliver innovative solutions to help advance pharmaceutical innovation and access."

Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 3.46%, an increase of 69 basis points from the prior year quarter primarily driven by the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare.

•Operating Expenses: In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, operating expenses were $1.4 billion, a 56.5 percent increase, primarily as a result of increases in distribution, selling, and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare.

("WBA") for the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare.

Segment Discussion

 The Company is organized geographically based upon the products and services it provides to its customers. The

Company has re-aligned its reporting structure under two reportable segments: U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions. U.S. Healthcare Solutions consists of the legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment (excluding Profarma), MWI Animal Health, Xcenda, Lash Group, and ICS 3PL. International Healthcare Solutions consists of Alliance Healthcare, World Courier, Innomar, Profarma, and Profarma Specialty. The Company’s previously reported segment results have been revised to conform to its re-aligned reporting structure.

U.S. Healthcare Solutions

 U.S. Healthcare Solutions revenue was $53.0 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 2.7 percent compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year primarily due to overall market growth, increased sales to specialty physician practices, and growth in the MWI Animal Health business, partially offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 therapies. Segment operating income of $569.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was up 0.6 percent compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year as a result of an increase in gross profit, largely offset by an increase in operating expenses.

International Healthcare Solutions

 Revenue in International Healthcare Solutions was $6.6 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase from the previous fiscal year’s first quarter of 604.2 percent on a reported basis, and 632 percent on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. Segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was $180.1 million, an increase of 253.1 percent on a reported basis and 268 percent on a constant currency basis, due to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to perform financial planning, and to determine incentive compensation. Therefore, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. The presented non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that management does not believe reflect the Company’s core operating performance because such items are outside the control of the Company or are inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash. We have included the following non-GAAP earnings-related financial measures in this release:

•Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin: Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes gains from antitrust litigation settlements and LIFO expense (credit). Adjusted gross profit margin is the ratio of adjusted gross profit to total revenue. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as a supplemental measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Gains from antitrust litigation settlements and LIFO expense (credit) are excluded because the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. Gains from antitrust litigation settlements relate to the settlement of lawsuits that have been filed against brand pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging that the manufacturer, by itself or in concert with others, took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drugs from entering the market. LIFO expense (credit) is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. 

•Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating expense margin: Adjusted operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes acquisition-related intangibles amortization, employee severance, litigation, and other, and impairment of assets. Adjusted operating expense margin is the ratio of adjusted operating expenses to total revenue. Acquisition-related intangibles amortization is excluded because it is a non-cash item and does not reflect the operating performance of the acquired companies. We exclude employee severance amounts that relate to unpredictable and/or non-recurring business restructuring. We exclude the amount of litigation settlements and other expenses and the impairment of assets that are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature because we believe these exclusions facilitate the analysis of our ongoing operational performance.

•Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin: Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted operating income margin is the ratio of adjusted operating income to total revenue. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company’s performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted income before income taxes: Adjusted income before income taxes is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted operating income. In addition, the gain on the currency remeasurement of the deferred tax asset relating to Swiss tax reform in the three months ended December 31, 2020 is excluded from adjusted income before income taxes because these amounts are unusual, non-operating, and non-recurring. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it facilitates the calculation of the Company’s adjusted effective tax rate.

•Adjusted effective tax rate: Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure that is determined by dividing adjusted income tax expense/benefit by adjusted income before income taxes. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it presents an effective tax rate that does not reflect unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash amounts or items that are outside the control of the Company.

•Adjusted income tax expense: Adjusted income tax expense is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the income tax expense associated with the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted income before income taxes. Certain discrete tax expense (benefits) primarily attributable to foreign valuation allowance adjustments for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and the income tax deduction recognized in connection with the permanent shutdown of PharMEDium as well as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") are also excluded 

from adjusted income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2020. Further, certain expenses relating to tax reform in Switzerland are excluded from adjusted income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company’s performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted net income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests: Adjusted net income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests excludes the non-controlling interest portion of acquisition-related intangibles amortization. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it facilitates the calculation of adjusted net income attributable to the Company. 

•Adjusted net income attributable to the Company: Adjusted net income attributable to the Company is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company's performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted diluted earnings per share: Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the per share impact of adjustments including gains from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense (credit); acquisition-related intangibles amortization; employee severance, litigation, and other; impairment of assets; and the loss on the currency remeasurement related to Swiss tax reform, in each case net of the tax effect calculated using the applicable effective tax rate for those items. In addition, the per share impact of certain discrete tax expense (benefits) primarily attributable to foreign valuation allowance adjustments for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and the income tax deduction recognized in connection with the permanent shutdown of PharMEDium as well as the CARES Act for the three months ended December 31, 2020, and the per share impact of certain expenses relating to tax reform in Switzerland are also excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the per share impact of the items that are outside the control of the Company or that we consider to not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature.

The company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the United States reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and this presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

In addition, the Company updated its non-GAAP fiscal year 2022 guidance for diluted earnings per share and operating income, and has previously provided non-GAAP fiscal year 2022 guidance for adjusted free cash flow and effective income tax rate. The guidance for each metric excludes the same or similar items as those that are excluded from the historical non-GAAP financial measures, as well as significant items that are outside the control of the Company or inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature. For fiscal year 2022, we have defined the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding other significant unpredictable or non-recurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. For the three months ended December 31, 2021 adjusted free cash flow of $808.9 million consisted of net cash provided by operating activities of $863.4 million minus capital expenditures of $79.7 million plus legal settlement payments of $25.2 million. The Company does not provide forward looking guidance on a GAAP basis for such metrics because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. For example, LIFO expense (credit) is largely dependent upon the future inflation or deflation of brand and generic pharmaceuticals, which is out of the Company’s control, and acquisition-related intangibles amortization depends on the timing and amount of future acquisitions, which cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the timing and amount of litigation settlements is unpredictable and non-recurring.
