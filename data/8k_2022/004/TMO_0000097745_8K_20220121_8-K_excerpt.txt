 Item 7.01  

Regulation FD Disclosure.  

On January 21, 2022, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the “Company”) notified the holders of its $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) that it will redeem all of the Notes on February 7, 2022 (the “Redemption Date”). The Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of the Notes to be redeemed discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury rate plus 25 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to be redeemed, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.  

The Company intends to fund the aggregate redemption price using cash on hand.  

The information in Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.  

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  

This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, the Company’s statements about its intended source of funds for the redemption. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to general economic conditions and related uncertainties; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; and any natural disaster, public health crisis or other catastrophic event. Additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are set forth in the Company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC and available in the “Investors” section of the Company’s website under the heading “SEC Filings,” and other documents the Company files with the SEC. While the Company may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if estimates change and, therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing the Company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
