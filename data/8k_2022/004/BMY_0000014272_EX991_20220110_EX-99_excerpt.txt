Exhibit 99.1

 January 10, 2022 JP Morgan Presentation    

 Forward Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Financial Information 2 This presentation contains statements about the Company’s future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. These documents are available on the SEC’s website, on the Bristol-Myers Squibb website or from Bristol-Myers Squibb Investor Relations. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of the date hereof and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change.This presentation includes certain non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures that we use to describe our company’s performance. The non-GAAP information presented provides investors with additional useful information but should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the related GAAP measures. Moreover, other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparisons with such other companies. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Also note that a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, however, is not provided due to no reasonably accessible or reliable comparable GAAP measures for such statements and the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying such measures that are necessary for such reconciliation. Namely, we are not able to reliably predict the impact of certain specified items or currency exchange rates beyond the next twelve months. As a result, the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. In addition, the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. The variability of the specified items may have a significant and unpredictable impact on our future GAAP results.
