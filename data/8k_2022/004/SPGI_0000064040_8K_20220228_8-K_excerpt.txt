 Item 2.01  

Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.  

On February 28, 2022, S&P Global Inc., a New York corporation (the “Company”), completed its previously announced merger with IHS Markit Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company limited by shares (“IHS Markit”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 29, 2020 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, dated as of January 20, 2021, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, IHS Markit and Sapphire Subsidiary, Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company limited by shares and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), Merger Sub merged with and into IHS Markit (the “Merger”), with IHS Markit continuing as the surviving company of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each common share, par value $0.01 per share, of IHS Markit (“IHS Markit Common Shares”) issued and outstanding (other than IHS Markit Common Shares held in treasury) was converted into the right to receive 0.2838 (the “Exchange Ratio”) newly issued shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”), with cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock, without interest.  

In addition, equity awards of IHS Markit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were generally converted into Company equity awards based on the Exchange Ratio with the same terms and conditions as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to certain exceptions. Each IHS Markit performance share unit award was converted into a Company restricted share unit award based on the Exchange Ratio (assuming target performance), with the possibility of earning up to 200% of the target award if the individual remains employed through the end of the applicable performance period.  

The issuance of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-251999) (the “Registration Statement”), declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 22, 2021.  

The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Annex A to Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement, filed with the SEC on January 20, 2021, and which is incorporated herein by reference.
