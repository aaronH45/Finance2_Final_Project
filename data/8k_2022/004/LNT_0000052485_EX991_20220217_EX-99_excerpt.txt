MADISON, Wis. - February 17, 2022 - Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: LNT) today announced U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP consolidated unaudited earnings per share (EPS) for 2021 and 2020 as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“2021 was another great year for Alliant Energy as we marked the 3rd consecutive year of delivering 7% EPS growth, and the 19th consecutive year of dividend growth,” said John Larsen, Alliant Energy Chair, President and CEO. “Looking forward to 2022, we are excited to begin placing some of our announced 1.5 gigawatts of solar generation in service and put that zero-emissions generation to work for our customers.”

Utilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy’s Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $2.52 per share of GAAP EPS in 2021, which was $0.16 per share higher than 2020. The primary drivers of higher EPS were higher earnings resulting from Interstate Power and Light Company’s (IPL’s) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company’s (WPL’s) increasing rate base, higher sales due to favorable temperature impacts versus 2020, as well as higher temperature-normalized sales due to recovery from COVID-19 sales impacts in 2020. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC).

Earnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for 2020 excludes $0.02 per share related to credit loss adjustments on a guarantee for an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum Corporation (Whiting Petroleum) and $0.02 per share related to a tax valuation allowance adjustment, both for Alliant Energy’s Non-utility and Parent. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.

Estimated Temperature Impacts to Non-GAAP EPS - The estimated impacts of temperatures on retail electric and gas sales were $0.05 per share and $0.01 per share gains in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS was $2.58 per share and $2.42 per share for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Details regarding GAAP EPS variances between 2021 and 2020 for Alliant Energy are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Higher revenue requirements primarily due to increasing rate base - In 2020, IPL received a final order from the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric customers based on a 2020 forward-looking Test Period. Effective with the implementation of final rates covering the 2020 forward-looking Test Period on February 26, 2020, IPL began recovering a return of, as well as earning a return on, its new wind generation placed in service in 2019 and 2020 from its retail electric customers through a renewable energy rider. Other applicable costs and tax benefits associated with the new wind generation, excluding operation and maintenance expenses, are also included in the rider. The renewable energy rider factor is updated on an annual basis using forecasted rate base and costs for the current year. The 2021 renewable energy rider factor includes the impact of the wind expansion completed in 2020, resulting in increased earnings for 2021. IPL recognized a $0.13 per share increase in 2021 primarily due to the higher revenue requirements from increasing rate base related to the wind generation placed in service during 2020. This increasing rate base completed in 2020 at IPL also resulted in higher depreciation expense and lower AFUDC in 2021.

In 2020, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued an order authorizing WPL to maintain its current retail electric and gas base rates, authorized return on equity, regulatory capital structure and earnings sharing mechanism through the end of 2021. WPL began to utilize anticipated fuel-related cost savings and excess deferred income tax benefits in 2021 to offset the revenue requirement impacts of increasing electric and gas rate base. WPL recognized a $0.17 per share increase in 2021 due to higher revenue requirements from increasing electric and gas rate base. This increasing rate base at WPL was primarily attributable to its Kossuth wind farm, which was placed in service in October 2020, and the expansion of its gas distribution system in Western Wisconsin, which was placed in service in November 2020. This increasing rate base completed in 2020 at WPL also resulted in higher depreciation expense and lower AFUDC in 2021.

Credit loss adjustment on guarantee for affiliate of Whiting Petroleum in 2020 - A wholly-owned subsidiary of Alliant Energy continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under multiple general partnership agreements. The partnership obligations include costs associated with the future abandonment of certain facilities owned by the partnerships. Whiting Petroleum completed its bankruptcy proceedings in the third quarter of 2020. Alliant Energy estimated a decrease in the current expected credit loss related to the guarantees and recognized $0.02 per share of earnings in 2020. This was a non-recurring increase to earnings in 2020.

Tax valuation allowance adjustment in 2020 - In prior years, valuation allowances related to certain tax credit carryforwards were recorded, since it was expected they would expire before utilized. Based on updated taxable income projections, it was determined that a portion of these credits would be utilized before they expire. Alliant Energy recognized a $0.02 per share increase of earnings in 2020 as a result of reversing a portion of the valuation allowance.

2022 Earnings Guidance

Alliant Energy’s is updating its EPS guidance for 2022 as follows. The midpoint of the 2022 EPS guidance was increased by $0.02 per share primarily due to increased 2022 capital expenditures related to solar generation.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy’s financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include the use of (1) income and EPS for year ended December 31, 2020 excluding credit loss adjustments on a guarantee for an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum and a tax valuation allowance adjustment; and (2) income and EPS for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020 excluding a tax valuation allowance adjustment. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy’s management also uses income, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation.

In addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL; Corporate Services; Utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Holdings; and Non-utility and Parent EPS for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.

This press release references year-over-year variances in utility electric margins and utility gas margins. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures that will be reported and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, in our 2021 Form 10-K.

This press release also includes temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because the measure facilitates period-to-period comparison of Alliant Energy’s operating performance and provides investors with information on a basis consistent with measures that management uses to assess Alliant Energy’s earnings growth rate.

The tax impact adjustments represent the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the estimated consolidated statutory tax rate.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings summaries that follow, and in the case of temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS, in the press release above.

Note: Unless otherwise noted, all “per share” references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.
