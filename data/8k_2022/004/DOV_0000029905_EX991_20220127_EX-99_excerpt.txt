MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY:

Dover’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard J. Tobin, said, “At the conclusion of our fiscal year end commentary, I typically thank our employees for their efforts in delivering our results, and our customers for their loyalty and trust. Recognizing that the operating environment of the past year was remarkably challenging, and in many ways continues to be such, I would like to be upfront and emphasize such recognition. We are humbled by the extraordinary efforts of our Dover team members in overcoming adversities during this past year which has enabled us to deliver strong operating results. We are grateful to our customers who trusted us with their businesses while adapting their supply chains and business models to a demanding operating environment. The resilience and creativity of our teams and the durability of our customer relationships were the key elements of our success this year, and we are committed to build upon those pillars into 2022 and mobilize to deliver another year of strong performance. Again, we thank you. 

“We delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and the full year posting organic revenue growth of 11% and 15%, respectively. Solid top line growth, improving mix of products and services, and our operational excellence and enterprise capabilities allowed us to deliver a robust increase in profitability and earnings per share. The operating environment became increasingly challenging as 2021 progressed. While we are proud of our efforts to combat these challenges, they did impact portions of our portfolio that operate with particularly complex supply chains and produce labor- and material-intensive products. We have taken actions to address these challenges, and we expect to convert revenue growth into earnings at a sequentially improving rate through 2022, which is reflected in our guidance.

“Our strong operational execution in 2021 was complemented by stepped-up disciplined capital allocation, as we continued to enhance our portfolio by deploying our highest amount of capital since 2016 toward numerous strategically and financially attractive capacity investments for organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions. These investments are part of our deliberate strategy to expand into markets with secular growth opportunities. Recognizing recent changes to our portfolio, we renamed our Fueling Solutions segment to ‘Clean Energy & Fueling’, and our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment to ‘Climate & Sustainability Technologies’ to better reflect the markets and customers served by these businesses.

“We begin 2022 with a constructive outlook and are well-equipped to navigate this persistently demanding operational environment. We see sustained strong demand conditions across much of our portfolio which is reflected in our order backlogs and which allows us to better plan our capacity, production and inventory, a major benefit in today’s constrained operating environment. While we expect the operational challenges in supply chain and labor availability to continue into early 2022, we will remain focused on delivering products and services to our customers against a robust backlog and actively managing margin headwinds. 

“We believe we are well-positioned to deliver robust top-line growth, margin expansion and EPS accretion in 2022. Our strategy remains unchanged: drive superior value-creation through growth in excess of GDP, continued profitability improvement, strong cash flow and smart capital deployment. The Dover team is prepared to continue delivering against our ambitious objectives to maximize value and benefits to our shareholders, customers, and employees.”

FULL YEAR 2022 GUIDANCE:

In 2022, Dover expects to generate GAAP EPS in the range of $7.45 to $7.65 (adjusted EPS of $8.45 to $8.65), based on full year revenue growth of 8% to 10% (7% to 9% on an organic basis). A full reconciliation between forecasted GAAP and forecasted adjusted measures in included as an exhibit herein.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2021

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Acquisitions

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of ECI Holding Company ("RegO"), Acme Cryo Intermediate Inc. ("Acme Cryogenics"), and LIQAL B.V. ("LIQAL") within the Clean Energy & Fueling segment for a total consideration of $945.9 million, net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration. 

For the full year 2021, the Company acquired nine businesses in separate transactions for total consideration of $1,125.1 million, net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration. The businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Clean Energy & Fueling, Engineered Products, Imaging & Identification, and Pumps & Process Solutions segments. The purchase price allocation for our acquisitions is preliminary and subject to change during the measurement period.

Dispositions

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed the disposition of Unified Brands ("UB"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company within the Climate & Sustainability segment, and Race Winning Brands ("RWB"), a equity method investment within the Engineered Products segment for a total consideration of $229.0 million and $45.0 million, respectively.

The UB disposition resulted in a preliminary pre-tax gain of $181.6 million, included within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and within the Climate & Sustainability Technologies segment for the year ended December 31, 2021. The preliminary pre-tax gain on sale is subject to standard working capital adjustments. The sale does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. 

The RWB disposition resulted in a pre-tax gain of $24.7 million, included within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and within the Engineered Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2021. The preliminary pre-tax gain on sale is subject to standard working capital adjustments. 

Segment Rename

Recognizing recent portfolio changes, the Company renamed the Fueling Solutions segment to ‘Clean Energy & Fueling’, and the Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment to ‘Climate & Sustainability Technologies’ to better reflect the markets and customers served by these businesses.

Rightsizing and Other Costs

During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021, rightsizing activities included restructuring charges of $6.0 million and $26.7 million, respectively, and other costs of $20.7 million and $11.7 million, respectively. For the full year 2021, restructuring expense was comprised primarily of restructuring programs initiated in 2020 and 2021 in response to demand conditions, asset charges related to a product line exit, as well as broad-based operational efficiency initiatives focusing on footprint consolidation and IT centralization. Other costs in Q4 and FY 2021 were comprised primarily of charges in our Climate & Sustainability Technologies segment related to an equity method investment impairment charge of $12.1 million and write-off of assets incurred in connection with an exit from certain Latin America countries of $6.1 million. Full year 2021 includes a $9.1 million payment received in Q3 for previously incurred restructuring costs related to a product line exit in our Engineered Products Segment.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, Management also discloses non-GAAP information that Management believes provides useful information to investors. Adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted net earnings per share, total segment earnings (EBIT), adjusted EBIT by segment, adjusted EBIT margin by segment, adjusted EBITDA by segment, adjusted EBITDA margin by segment, net debt, net capitalization, net debt to net capitalization ratios, free cash flow, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted earnings, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, diluted net earnings per share, debt or equity, cash flows from operating activities, or revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Adjusted net earnings represents net earnings adjusted for the effect of acquisition-related amortization, rightsizing and other costs/benefits, and gain/loss on dispositions. We exclude after-tax acquisition-related amortization because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions the Company consummates. We exclude the other items because they occur for reasons that may be unrelated to the Company's commercial performance during the period and/or Management believes they are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period. 

Adjusted diluted net earnings per share represents adjusted net earnings divided by average diluted shares. 

Total segment earnings (EBIT) is defined as net earnings before income taxes, net interest expense and corporate expenses. Total segment earnings (EBIT) margin is defined as total segment earnings (EBIT) divided by revenue.

Adjusted EBIT by Segment is defined as net earnings before income taxes, net interest expense, corporate expenses, rightsizing and other costs/benefits, and gain/loss on dispositions. Adjusted EBIT Margin by Segment is defined as adjusted EBIT by segment divided by segment revenue.

Adjusted EBITDA by Segment is defined as adjusted EBIT by segment plus depreciation and amortization, excluding depreciation and amortization included within rightsizing and other costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin by Segment is defined as adjusted EBITDA by segment divided by segment revenue.

Management believes these measures are useful to investors to better understand the Company’s ongoing profitability as they will better reflect the Company's core operating results, offer more transparency and facilitate easier comparability to prior and future periods and to its peers.

Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. Net debt to net capitalization ratio equals net debt divided by net capitalization. Management believes the net debt to net capitalization ratio is useful to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity. 

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net earnings equals free cash flow divided by adjusted net earnings. Management believes that free cash flow and free cash flow ratios are important measures of operating performance because they provide management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock. 

Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, provides a useful comparison of our revenue and bookings performance and trends between periods.

Performance Measures Definitions

Bookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends. 

Organic bookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisition and dispositions. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends. 

IS - 12

Backlog represents an estimate of the total remaining bookings at a point in time for which performance obligations have not yet have satisfied. This metric is useful as it represents the aggregate amount we expect to recognize as revenue in the future. 

We use the above operational metrics in monitoring the performance of the business. We believe the operational metrics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in assessing the performance of our segments.
