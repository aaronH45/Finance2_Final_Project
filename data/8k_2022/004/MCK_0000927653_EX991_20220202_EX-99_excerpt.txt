Fiscal 2022 Third-Quarter Result Summary

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

"Our dedicated team members delivered another quarter of strong financial results, demonstrating our continued focus on our strategic growth initiatives, company priorities, and value creation for all stakeholders," said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. "As a result of our underlying business performance across all segments, and our ongoing support of the COVID-19 response efforts, we are raising our previous guidance range for fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share to $23.55 to $23.95."

Third-quarter revenues were $68.6 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.

Third-quarter loss per diluted share from continuing operations of ($0.04) included an after-tax charge of $829 million for the fair value remeasurement related to McKesson’s previously announced agreement to sell the retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom. Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share did not include these charges.

Third-quarter fiscal year 2021 loss per diluted share of ($39.03) included a pre-tax $8.1 billion expense accrual related to the opioid litigation.

Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $6.15 compared to $4.60 a year ago, an increase of 34%, driven by strong operating performance across the segments, the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs with the U.S. government, and a lower share count.

For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $2.0 billion of common stock repurchases and $206 million of dividend payments. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $1.5 billion, and invested $380 million in capital expenditures, resulting in Free Cash Flow of $1.2 billion.

Business Highlights

•Through January 31, 2022, U.S. Pharmaceutical successfully shipped over 370 million vaccines on behalf of the U.S. government. McKesson continues to play a leading role in the fight against COVID-19.

•McKesson continued to progress in its planned exit from Europe, closing two transactions in the quarter:

◦After entering an agreement in November 2021 to sell the remaining share of GEHE Pharma Handel and Alliance Healthcare Deutschland joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance, McKesson closed the transaction on January 31, 2022.

◦After entering an agreement in December 2021 to sell its Austrian business to Quadrifolia Management GmbH, McKesson closed the transaction on January 31, 2022.

U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment

•Third-quarter revenues were $55.0 billion, an increase of 11%, driven by higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.

•Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $744 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $735 million, an increase of 12%, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems.

Prescription Technology Solutions Segment

•Third-quarter revenues were $1.0 billion, an increase of 33%, driven by volume growth related to biopharma services, including third party logistic services and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. 

•Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $129 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $145 million, an increase of 11%, driven by growth from access and adherence solutions.

Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment

•Third-quarter revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 1%, driven by growth and improvements in the primary care business and the contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program, partially offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 tests.

•Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $308 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $330 million, an increase of 18%, driven by the contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and growth in the primary care business.

International Segment

•Third-quarter revenues were $9.5 billion on a reported and FX-Adjusted basis, an increase of 2%, driven by sales to new customers in the Canadian business, partially offset by the contribution of McKesson's German pharmaceutical wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance.

•Third-quarter Segment Operating Loss was ($668) million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $223 million, an increase of 41%, driven by the reduction over the prior year of depreciation and amortization on European assets under agreements to sell and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and personal protective equipment.

Company Updates 

•On December 8, 2021, McKesson hosted an Investor Day where management highlighted progress against the company’s growth strategies and presented compelling long-term financial targets.

Fiscal 2022 Outlook

McKesson raised fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance to $23.55 to $23.95 from the previous range of $22.35 to $22.95 to reflect strong operating performance and increased contribution from the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage programs.

Fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance includes approximately $2.99 to $3.59 of impacts attributable to the following:

•$1.75 to $2.15 related to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage programs;

•$0.75 to $0.95 related to the COVID-19 tests and impairments for personal protective equipment and related products;

•$0.49 related to year-to-date gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures’ equity investments.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Loss on Debt Extinguishment, Adjusted Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.

Cautionary Statements

This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “projects,” “plans”, “estimates” or the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial outlook, trends, strategy, plans, assumptions, or intentions may also include forward-looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as financial performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, we encourage investors to read the risk factors described in our most recent annual and periodic report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

These risk factors include, but are not limited to: we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes and settlements, including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might experience losses not covered by insurance; we might be adversely impacted by changes in tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions; we from time to time record significant charges from impairment to goodwill, intangibles, inventory and other assets or investments; we experience cybersecurity incidents and might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches; we might experience significant problems with information systems or networks; we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy profitability; we might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-renewal; our contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks; we might be harmed by changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by delays or other difficulties with divestitures; we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models; we might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply and we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and changes in pricing due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains; we might be adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely impacted by an economic slowdown (including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic) or recession and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access to credit, increase our borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues (including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events and other catastrophic events; we may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; and we face uncertainties and risks related to COVID-19 vaccination mandates and to vaccination distribution and related ancillary supply kit programs.

(a)Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.

(b)We calculate loss per diluted common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation (GAAP) for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 using a weighted average of 151.6 million, 159.5 million, and 161.2 million common shares, respectively, which excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effect when calculating a net loss per diluted share. We calculate adjusted earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 on a fully diluted basis, using a weighted average of 153.5 million, 161.0 million, and 162.5 million common shares, respectively. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a fully diluted basis, any footing differences in those items are due to different weighted average share counts. This methodology results in per share differences of $0.36 and $0.26 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020, respectively.

(c)Adjusted earnings per diluted share on an FX-adjusted basis for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 was $6.15 and $17.75, respectively, which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of zero and $0.11, respectively.

Additionally, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes immaterial amounts under “gross profit” in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

2 of 3

FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(7)Claims and litigation charges, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 includes a pre-tax charge of $27 million ($22 million after-tax) related to an agreement to settle opioid-related claims with the State of New York and its participating subdivisions, including Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and a pre-tax charge of $47 million ($39 million after-tax) related to our estimated liability for a comprehensive proposed agreement to settle opioid-related claims of participating states, their political subdivisions, and other government entities, within Corporate expenses, net. These charges are included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(8)Claims and litigation charges, net for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of $8.1 billion ($6.7 billion after-tax) related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims of states, their political subdivisions, and other government entities, within Corporate expenses, net. This charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

This gain is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(10)Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 includes a pre-tax loss of $191 million ($141 million after-tax) on debt extinguishment related to our July 2021 tender offer to redeem a portion of our existing debt. This charge is included under "loss on debt extinguishment" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(11)Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 includes pre-tax charges of $155 million ($118 million after-tax) related to inventory write downs on certain excess personal protective equipment within Medical-Surgical Solutions. These charges are driven by the intent of management to not sell this excess inventory which required inventory write downs to zero net realizable value, and instead direct it to charitable organizations. A portion of this inventory was committed for donation during our first quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to the nature of this expected in-kind donation of inventory in a quantitatively significant amount, management believes this charge is not part of normal business operations and is therefore excluded from our determination of adjusted results. A pre-tax charge of $147 million ($112 million after-tax) is included under "gross profit" primarily related to the excess inventory, which we no longer plan to sell and instead plan to donate, and a pre-tax charge of $8 million ($6 million after-tax) is included under "total operating expenses" related to the already committed donation in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(12)Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $69 million (pre-tax and after-tax) within International related to our European retail business, partially offset by the related indirect effect of $4 million benefit in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. This impairment charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

3 of 3

FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(13)Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of $50 million ($37 million after-tax) related to our estimated liability under the New York ("NY") state Opioid Stewardship Act ("OSA") within U.S. Pharmaceutical for calendar years 2017 and 2018. In December 2018, a federal district court struck down the law as unconstitutional and NY replaced the OSA with an excise tax on opioid sales in the state of NY covering calendar year 2019 sales and beyond. In September 2020, an appellate court reversed on procedural grounds the district court’s decision. An amendment to the Act made clear that the OSA applies only to NY opioid sales or distributions for calendar years 2017 and 2018. On October 4, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court denied further review, and, as a result, we anticipate facing liability under the OSA for calendar years 2017 and 2018. We believe the estimated OSA liability is one-time in nature because the liability is retroactively imposed on sales or distributions in 2017 and 2018, and is not indicative of future results. Inclusion of this accrual in our adjusted results would distort current period performance. This charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our Non-GAAP measures as defined above:

Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration, and other expenses that are directly related to business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures, and other transaction-related costs including initial public offering costs. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, severance charges, retention payments and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees and gains or losses on business combinations, and divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

Restructuring, impairment, and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from adjusted results.

Claims and litigation charges - Adjustments to certain of the Company’s reserves, including those related to estimated probable settlements for its controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred.

Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share on an FX-Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less payments for property, plant and equipment and capitalized software expenditures, as disclosed in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Management utilizes Non-GAAP financial measures when allocating resources, deploying capital, as well as assessing business performance, and determining employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP adjusted results and related Non-GAAP measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
