Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On February 28, 2022, Alliant Energy Finance, LLC (“AEF”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alliant Energy Corporation (“Alliant Energy”), issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.600% Senior Notes due 2032 (the “Notes”), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Alliant Energy on a senior unsecured basis. The Notes were sold in a private offering only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (the “Offering”). The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of February 28, 2022, among AEF, Alliant Energy, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Indenture”).

The Notes are AEF’s senior unsecured indebtedness and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Alliant Energy. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.600% per annum, accruing from February 28, 2022. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2022. The Notes will mature on March 1, 2032, subject to earlier repurchase or redemption in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

At any time and from time to time prior to December 1, 2031, AEF may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes being redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) that would be due if the Notes matured on December 1, 2031, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the treasury rate plus 25 basis points, plus unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption.

The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict AEF’s and Alliant Energy’s ability, and the ability of certain of Alliant Energy’s other subsidiaries, to create liens, and AEF’s and Alliant Energy’s ability to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease their respective properties and assets substantially as an entirety. The Indenture also provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include nonpayment, breach of covenants, payment defaults, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. These covenants and events of default are subject to a number of important qualifications, limitations and exceptions that are described in the Indenture. If an event of default with respect to the Notes occurs under the Indenture, the principal amount of all of the Notes then outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of acceleration, may become immediately due and payable.

The foregoing summary of the Indenture is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual text of the Indenture, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

The net proceeds from the Offering are intended to be used to reduce Alliant Energy’s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.
