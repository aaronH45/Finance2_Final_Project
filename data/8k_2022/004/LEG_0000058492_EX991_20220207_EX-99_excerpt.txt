President and CEO Mitch Dolloff commented, “We are pleased to have delivered record1 full year results in 2021 despite a myriad of macro market challenges, including supply chain issues related to semiconductor shortages, foam chemical shortages, labor availability, and transportation challenges, as well as higher costs associated with each of these issues. We also delivered record1 quarterly sales and solid operating results in the fourth quarter. Despite these ongoing challenges, including inflation and a likely shift to tighter monetary policy, we expect continued improvement in 2022 as conditions gradually stabilize and growth continues in our businesses most negatively impacted by the pandemic.  

“In addition to record results, Leggett achieved several milestones in 2021. We increased our dividend for the 50th consecutive year, honoring our commitment to return value to our shareholders. We strengthened our balance sheet by extending our debt maturity profile with the issuance of 30-year notes. We completed three small acquisitions that expanded our capabilities in International Bedding, Aerospace, and Work Furniture. Leggett remains well-positioned, both competitively and financially, to capitalize on long-term opportunities in our various end markets. Our enduring fundamentals give us confidence in our ability to continue creating long-term value for our shareholders.  

“Finally, I would like to thank our employees for their tremendous contributions in another challenging year. Your collaboration, agility, dedication, and commitment to our values drive our success.”
