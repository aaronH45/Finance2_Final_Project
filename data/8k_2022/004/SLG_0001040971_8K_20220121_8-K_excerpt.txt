SLG has filed Articles of Amendment (the “Articles of Amendment”) to amend its charter to effect the Reverse Stock Split, effective immediately after the close of business on January 21, 2022, and SLG’s common stock will begin trading on a post-split basis on January 24, 2022. Pursuant to the Articles of Amendment, every 1.03060 shares of SLG’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in the Reverse Stock Split, and cash will be paid in lieu of any fraction of a share to which a stockholder would otherwise be entitled. 

The description of the Articles of Amendment set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Articles of Amendment, which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2 to this report and are incorporated herein by reference.

Forward-looking statements contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made by us. Factors and risks to our business that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties related to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and the duration and impact it will have on our business and the industry as a whole and the other risks and uncertainties described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise.
