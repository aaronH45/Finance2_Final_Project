 Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure 

This report is filed quarterly to disclose assets under management (“AUM”) by asset manager, prior to the availability of Principal Financial Group, Inc's (the "Company") quarterly earnings release. The amounts presented herein will be consistent with the format of AUM by asset manager and presented again in such format within the Company's financial supplement for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 when that document is posted to the Company's investor relations web site on or about February 7, 2022. 

As of December 31, 2021, the assets under management by asset manager were $546.5 billion for Principal Global Investors and $167.4 billion for Principal International and Other Entities of Principal Financial Group.1 Principal International and Other Entities of Principal Financial Group includes Principal International, Principal Bank, assets managed by segments of the insurance company and sub-advised assets within the RIS segment. 

1 Effective 4Q21, $4.7 billion of AUM moved out of Principal Global Investors and $14.1 billion of AUM moved into Principal International and Other Entities of Principal Financial Group through Other on a prospective basis due to an internal definition change relating to AUM and assets under administration (“AUA”). 

Note: During 2021, we exited our retail investment and retirement business in India which resulted in $1.2 billion through Operations Disposed for Principal Global Investors. 

Note: Principal Global Investors delivers products and services through our network of focused investment teams. During times of market dislocations and a wider dispersion of returns, it is important to note our exposure to small and mid-cap products in US equity AUM and high yield and preferred securities exposure in fixed income AUM. Principal International and Other Entities of Principal Financial Group includes AUM associated with Principal International where AUM is translated to U.S. dollar equivalents using end of reporting period spot foreign exchange rates.
