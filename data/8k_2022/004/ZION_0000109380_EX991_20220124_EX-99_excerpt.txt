CEO COMMENTARY

Harris H. Simmons, Chairman and CEO of Zions Bancorporation, commented, “We were pleased with our fourth quarter results, which included $1.4 billion of non-PPP loan growth relative to the third quarter – an 11.7% annualized growth rate after a period of attrition in loan volumes in earlier months of the pandemic. Credit quality remained very strong, as demonstrated by a 0.01% annualized net charge-off rate, both for the fourth quarter and the full year. Customer-related noninterest income increased 9.4% over the prior year’s fourth quarter.

“Finally, continued strong growth in average deposits, which increased 19.3% over the prior year quarter – with average noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprising 51% of total deposits versus 47% a year ago – allowed us to increase our securities portfolio by 43% from the year-ago period, while leaving considerable upside for margin expansion as interest rates rise.”

Comparisons noted in the sections below are calculated for the current quarter versus the same prior-year period, unless otherwise specified. Growth rates of 100% or more are considered not meaningful (“NM”) as they generally reflect a low initial starting point.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Rates are calculated using amounts in thousands and a tax rate of 21% for the periods presented. 

Net interest income increased $3 million to $553 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven largely by a significant increase in average earning assets. Growth in these assets had a dilutive effect on the net interest margin, given an increased concentration in lower-yielding assets and the low interest rate environment.

Average interest-earning assets increased $11.4 billion, or 15%, driven by growth in money market investments, securities, and commercial loans (ex-PPP). These increases were partially offset by declines in PPP and consumer loans. Average money market investments, including short-term deposits held at the Federal Reserve, increased to 15.4% of average interest-earning assets, compared with 7.2%. Average securities increased to 25.9% of average interest-earning assets, compared with 20.9%, as we have actively deployed excess liquidity into short-to-medium duration securities.

The net interest margin was 2.58%, compared with 2.95%. The yield on average interest-earning assets was 2.64% in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of 42 basis points. The yield on total loans remained relatively stable at 3.73%, compared with 3.71%. Excluding PPP loans, the yield on loans decreased 18 basis points. The yield on securities decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to lower yields on re-investment of principal payments and other purchases throughout the year.

The annualized cost of total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 0.03%, compared with 0.08%. The rate paid on total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities was 0.06%, a decrease from 0.12% during the fourth quarter of 2020, which was primarily due to low deposit rates and strong noninterest bearing deposit growth. Average noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were 51%, compared with 47% for the same prior year period.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, more than 10,000 PPP loans, totaling $1.1 billion, were forgiven by the SBA. Total interest income from PPP loans was $44 million, of which $30 million was related to accelerated recognition of net unamortized deferred fees on these loans due to forgiveness. At December 31, 2021, the remaining unamortized net origination fees on these loans totaled $45 million.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total customer-related fees increased $13 million, or 9%, to $152 million, driven by increased capital markets and foreign exchange activity, card fees, and wealth management fees, partially offset by a decrease in loan-related fees and income. 

Dividends and other income increased $12 million, primarily due to the gain on sale of certain bank-owned facilities during the quarter. These sales resulted from the consolidation of a substantial portion of our technology and operations facilities in advance of occupying our new Corporate Technology Center, which is expected to be completed in mid-2022. The new technology campus will allow us to achieve efficiencies by eliminating smaller facilities and reducing related occupancy costs.

Net securities gains and losses increased $8 million, primarily due to net gains related to our SBIC investment portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized a $31 million realized gain resulting from the sale of one of our SBIC investments, which was partially offset by a $12 million negative mark-to-market adjustment to our investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., reducing our remaining $35 million unrealized gain from the third quarter of 2021.

We recognized a $1 million loss related to a credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) on client-related interest rate swaps, compared with an $8 million CVA gain in the prior year period. The CVA may fluctuate from period to period based on the credit quality of our clients and changes in interest rates, which impacts the value of, and our credit exposure to, the client-related interest rate swaps.

Noninterest expense increased $25 million, or 6%, relative to the prior year quarter, and was largely attributable to a $21 million increase in other noninterest expense. This increase was primarily due to a $10 million donation to our charitable foundation, as well as increases related to a success fee accrual adjustment for our SBIC investments, software licenses and maintenance, and other business development costs.

Salaries and benefits expense increased $5 million, or 2%, and was partially offset by a $4 million, or 21% decrease in professional and legal services, largely due to higher technology spend and third-party assistance related to PPP loan forgiveness in the prior year period.

Adjusted noninterest expense increased $23 million, or 5%, to $446 million, and includes the previously discussed $10 million charitable contribution, compared with $423 million for the prior year period. The efficiency ratio was 60.8%, compared with 60.2%. Excluding the $10 million charitable contribution, the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter of 2021 would have been 59.4%. For information on non-GAAP financial measures, including differences between noninterest expense and adjusted noninterest expense, see pages 17-19.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Loans and leases, net of unearned income and fees, decreased $2.6 billion, or 5%, to $50.9 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily due to the forgiveness of PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, total loans and leases increased $1.1 billion, or 2%, to $49.0 billion. Municipal loans, owner occupied loans, and commercial and industrial loans increased $0.7 billion, $0.5 billion, and $0.4 billion, respectively. Consumer 1-4 family residential mortgage loans decreased $0.9 billion, primarily due to continued refinancing activity, while home equity lines of credit increased $0.3 billion. 

Unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit increased $1.7 billion, or 7%, to $26.7 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily due to growth in our home equity credit line and commercial and industrial loan portfolios as well as a decrease in commitment utilization.

Net loan and lease charge-offs were $1 million, compared with $15 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting strong credit performance. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a positive $25 million provision for credit losses, compared with a negative $67 million provision for the prior year period. The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) was $553 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $835 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the ACL was due largely to improvements in economic forecasts and credit quality, compared with the economic stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year period, and was partially offset by the expected impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 cases resulting from the Omicron variant. The ratio of ACL to total loans and leases (ex-PPP) was 1.13% at December 31, 2021, compared with 1.74% at December 31, 2020. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total deposits increased $13.1 billion, or 19%, to $82.8 billion, primarily due to a $8.6 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. Average total deposits increased to $81.4 billion, compared with $68.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased 29% to $41.4 billion, from $32.0 billion, and were 51% and 47% of average total deposits for the respective time periods.

Total borrowed funds decreased $1.0 billion, or 34%, to $1.9 billion. Average borrowed funds decreased to $1.7 billion, compared with $2.7 billion for the prior year quarter. The decrease in long-term debt was primarily due to the maturity of $281 million of 3-year, 3.50% senior notes during the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in overall borrowed funds continues to reflect less reliance on federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings due to strong deposit growth.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The common stock dividend was $0.38 per share, compared with $0.34 during the prior year quarter. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 10.3 million from the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to share repurchases. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we repurchased 5.0 million common shares outstanding for $325 million, which was equivalent to 3.2% of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2021. During the last four quarters, we repurchased 13.5 million common shares outstanding for $800 million, which was equivalent to 8.2% of common stock outstanding as of the prior year end.

Preferred stock decreased $126 million due to the redemption of the outstanding shares of our 5.75% Series H Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock at par value during the second quarter of 2021. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $405 million to a loss of $80 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to decreases in the fair value of available-for-sale securities as a result of changes in interest rates. 

Tangible book value per common share increased to $39.62, compared with $38.42. Basel III common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital was $6.1 billion, compared with $6.0 billion. The estimated Basel III CET1 capital ratio was 10.2%, compared with 10.8%.

Our Tier 1 leverage ratio declined to 7.2% from 8.3%, and has become more relevant in our capital adequacy assessments. Recent deposit-driven balance sheet growth has resulted in a modest reduction in our risk-weighted regulatory capital ratios, but a larger reduction in the Tier 1 leverage ratio, as the denominator for this ratio is not adjusted for risk.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(Unaudited)

This press release presents non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to provide investors with additional information. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following schedules. We consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and to provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our performance, financial position, and for presentations of our performance to investors. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess our performance on the same basis as that applied by our management and the financial services industry.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations and are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other financial services companies. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.

Tangible Common Equity and Related Measures

Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our use of shareholders’ equity and provide a basis for evaluating the performance of a business more consistently, whether acquired or developed internally.

Efficiency Ratio and Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue

The efficiency ratio is a measure of operating expense relative to revenue. We believe the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. The methodology of determining the efficiency ratio may differ among companies. We make adjustments to exclude certain items that are not generally expected to recur frequently, as identified in the subsequent schedule, which we believe allow for more consistent comparability among periods. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how well we are managing our expenses; adjusted pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”) enables management and others to assess our ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows us to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.
