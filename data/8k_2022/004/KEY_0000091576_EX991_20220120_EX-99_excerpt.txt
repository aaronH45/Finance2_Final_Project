TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

TE = Taxable Equivalent

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the net interest margin was 2.44%. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, net interest income decreased $5 million, while the net interest margin decreased by 26 basis points. Both net interest income and the net interest margin reflect the impact of lower reinvestment yields and the exit of the indirect auto loan portfolio, largely offset by a favorable earning asset mix. The net interest margin was also impacted by elevated levels of liquidity as we continued to experience higher levels of deposit inflows in 2021.

Compared to the third quarter of 2021, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $13 million and the net interest margin decreased by 3 basis points. The increase in net interest income was driven by balance sheet growth and a favorable mix of earning assets, as well as higher loan fees from the PPP forgiveness and core portfolio growth. Additionally, both net interest income and the net interest margin were impacted by lower reinvestment yields and the exit of the indirect auto loan portfolio.

 Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, noninterest income increased by $107 million. The increase was primarily driven by investment banking and debt placement fees, up $80 million. Additionally, commercial mortgage servicing fees and other income both increased $16 million. Partially offsetting the increase was a $18 million decrease in consumer mortgage income, driven by higher balance sheet retention and lower gain on sale margins. 

Compared to the third quarter of 2021, noninterest income increased by $112 million. The primary driver was investment banking and debt placement fees, which increased $88 million. Additionally, commercial mortgage servicing fees increased $14 million and other income increased $33 million, reflecting market related gains. Partially offsetting the increase was a $25 million decrease in cards and payments income, driven by lower prepaid card revenue.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Key’s noninterest expense was $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $42 million from the year-ago period. The increase in nonpersonnel expense was primarily driven by higher business services and professional fees and computer processing fees. The increase in personnel expense reflects higher incentive and stock-based compensation from strong fee production, partially offset by lower severance. 

 Compared to the third quarter of 2021, noninterest expense increased $58 million. The increase was largely related to personnel expense, reflecting higher incentive and stock-based compensation. The increase in nonpersonnel expense was driven by higher business services and professional fees.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Commercial and industrial average loan balances include $141 million, $137 million, and $129 million of assets from commercial credit cards at December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Average loans were $99.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of $2.3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Commercial loans decreased by $3.5 billion, reflecting a decline in PPP balances. Total PPP loan forgiveness was $8.0 billion for 2021. Partly offsetting the decrease was core growth in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans. Consumer loans increased $1.2 billion, reflecting strength from Key's consumer mortgage business and Laurel Road, partly offset by the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio.

Compared to the third quarter of 2021, average loans decreased by $741 million. Commercial loans were relatively unchanged from the prior quarter as declines in PPP balances were largely offset by core growth in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans. Consumer loans decreased $764 million, reflecting the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio, which reduced average loans by $2.7 billion. In addition, we continued to experience strength from Key's consumer mortgage business and Laurel Road.

N/A = Not Applicable

 Average deposits totaled $151.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $15.3 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects growth from consumer and commercial relationships, including higher commercial escrow and retail deposits, partially offset by a decline in time deposits.

Compared to the third quarter of 2021, average deposits increased by $4.1 billion, primarily driven by higher commercial escrow balances and retail deposits.

 Key's provision for credit losses was $4 million, compared to $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a net benefit of $107 million in the third quarter of 2021.

 Net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2021 totaled $19 million, or .08% of average total loans. These results compare to $135 million, or .53%, for the fourth quarter of 2020 and $29 million, or .11%, for the third quarter of 2021. Key’s allowance for credit losses was $1.2 billion, or 1.20% of total period-end loans at December 31, 2021, compared to 1.80% at December 31, 2020, and 1.25% at September 30, 2021. 

 At December 31, 2021, Key’s nonperforming loans totaled $454 million, which represented .45% of period-end portfolio loans. These results compare to .78% at December 31, 2020, and .56% at September 30, 2021. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2021, totaled $489 million, and represented .48% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets. These results compare to .92% at December 31, 2020, and .61% at September 30, 2021.

CAPITAL

Key’s estimated risk-based capital ratios included in the following table continued to exceed all “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2021.

(a)December 31, 2021 ratio is estimated and reflects Key's election to adopt the CECL optional transition provision.

(b)The table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons. 

Key's capital position remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2021. As shown in the preceding table, at December 31, 2021, Key’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 9.4% and 10.7%, respectively. Key's tangible common equity ratio was 6.9% at December 31, 2021. 

 Key has elected the CECL phase-in option provided by regulatory guidance which delays for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital and phases it in over three years beginning in 2022. On a fully phased-in basis, Key's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio would be reduced by 17 basis points.

 During the fourth quarter of 2021, Key declared a dividend of $.195 per common share, representing a 5% increase from the prior quarter. The reduction in share count was driven by the final settlement of 2.5 million shares related to the accelerated share repurchase program disclosed in the third quarter of 2021. There were no additional open market share repurchases in the fourth quarter.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(Dollars in millions)

The table below presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “pre-provision net revenue," and “cash efficiency ratio."

The tangible common equity ratio and the return on average tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock.

The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze the results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.

The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. As such, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of Key’s intangible asset amortization from the calculation. Management believes this ratio provide greater consistency and comparability between Key’s results and those of its peer banks. Additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
