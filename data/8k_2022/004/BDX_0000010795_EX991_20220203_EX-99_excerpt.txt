Segment Results

First fiscal quarter revenue growth across the segments was driven by strong base business performance. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1Represents a non-GAAP financial measure; refer to reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures included in the attached financial tables.

The BD Medical segment includes the Medication Delivery Solutions (MDS), Medication Management Solutions (MMS), Pharmaceutical Systems (PS), and Diabetes Care (DC) business units. BD Medical revenue growth was driven by strong performance in MDS and PS. 

•MDS performance reflects strong growth in the U.S., particularly catheters and vascular care products. 

•MMS performance reflects the anticipated decline in the infusion business due to high demand for infusion pumps in the prior year in the U.S. and Europe that was partially offset by strong demand in the dispensing platform.

•PS performance reflects continued strong demand for pre-fillable devices enabled by capacity expansion. 

•DC performance reflects category leadership aided by the timing of certain customer orders in the U.S. 

The BD Life Sciences segment includes the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions (IDS) and Biosciences (BDB) business units. BD Life Sciences performance reflects the decline in COVID-only testing revenues, partially offset by growth in the base business of 16.7% as reported and 17.2% on a currency-neutral basis. 

•IDS performance reflects a decline in COVID-only testing revenues to $185 million from $866 million in the prior year, partially offset by growth in the base business of 19.8% as reported, and 20.3% on a currency-neutral basis. Base business growth was driven by continued recovery in demand for specimen management products and microbiology solutions, licensing revenues, and demand for combination flu/COVID-19 diagnostic tests.

•BDB performance reflects continued strong demand for research solutions driven by the recovery in lab activity and continued COVID-19 research. 

The BD Interventional segment includes the Surgery, Peripheral Intervention (PI), and Urology & Critical Care (UCC) business units. BD Interventional revenue growth reflects strong performance in Surgery and UCC. 

•Surgery performance reflects growth across the hernia, biosurgery and infection prevention platforms as deferrable procedure volumes recovered compared to the prior year and was also aided by the recent acquisition of Tepha. 

•PI performance reflects the impact of a fiscal 2021 product recall, supply chain disruptions and planned product line discontinuations to support portfolio simplification and margin enhancement, partially offset by continued strong performance in atherectomy, particularly in China, and the benefit from the recent acquisition of Venclose.

•UCC performance was driven by continued strong demand for acute urology products.

Assumptions and Outlook for Full Year Fiscal 2022

The company raised its full year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. 

•The company now expects fiscal year 2022 revenues to be in the range of $19.55 billion to $19.75 billion, which reflects an increase of approximately $250 million compared to approximately $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion previously announced. 

•Revenue guidance for fiscal year 2022 now assumes base business currency-neutral revenue growth of 5.75% to 6.75%, compared to 5% to 6% previously announced, which represents an increase of approximately $150 million. 

•In addition, the revenue guidance range now assumes approximately $450 million in COVID-19-only diagnostic testing revenues, which is an increase of $250 million compared to approximately $200 million previously announced. 

•Based on current rates, foreign exchange would represent a headwind of approximately 125 basis points to total company revenue growth compared to approximately 50 basis points previously announced, which represents an incremental headwind of approximately $150 million. 

•The company now expects fiscal year 2022 adjusted diluted EPS to be $12.80 to $13.00, including an incremental headwind of approximately $0.10 from foreign currency, compared to $12.30 to $12.50 previously.

BD's outlook for fiscal 2022 reflects numerous assumptions about many factors that could affect its business, based on the information management has reviewed as of this date, which includes assumptions regarding the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the company’s outlook continues to assume no extended major system-wide hospital restrictions on deferrable procedures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Management will discuss its outlook and several of its assumptions on its first fiscal quarter earnings call. 

The company's expected adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal 2022 excludes potential charges or gains that may be recorded during the fiscal year, such as, among other things, the non-cash amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related charges, spin-off related charges, and certain tax matters. BD does not attempt to provide reconciliations of forward-looking adjusted diluted non-GAAP EPS guidance to the comparable GAAP measure because the impact and timing of these potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts. In addition, the company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of BD’s financial performance.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures/Financial Tables

This news release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include revenue growth rates on a currency-neutral basis and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. BD management believes that the use of non-GAAP measures to adjust for items that are considered by management to be outside of BD’s underlying operational results or that affect period to period comparability helps investors to gain a better understanding of our performance year-over-year, to analyze underlying trends in our businesses, to analyze our base operating results, and understand future prospects. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to measure and forecast the company’s performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. We believe presenting such adjusted metrics provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by BD management for its operational decision-making and for comparison for other companies within the medical technology industry. Although BD’s management believes non-GAAP results are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, its reliance on these measures is limited since items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on BD’s net income, earnings per share or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP results in conjunction with GAAP results to address these limitations. BD strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by BD may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered replacements for, and should be read together with, the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 

Current and prior-year adjusted diluted earnings per share results exclude, among other things, the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, integration and restructuring costs, spin-off related charges, certain transaction gains and losses, certain legal defense and product remediation costs, certain regulatory costs, certain investment gains and losses, the impact of the extinguishment of debt and the dilutive impact of outstanding preferred stock. 

We also provide these measures, as well as revenues, on a currency-neutral basis after eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation, where applicable. We calculate foreign currency-neutral percentages by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results.

Reconciliations of these and other non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial tables. Within the attached financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts.
