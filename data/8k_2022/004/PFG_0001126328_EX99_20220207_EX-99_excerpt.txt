"2021 was a milestone year for Principal, marked by the execution of our strategic review as well as our 20th anniversary as a public company,” said Dan Houston, chairman, president, and CEO of Principal®. “With a renewed focus on higher growth markets and improved capital efficiency, we were able to deliver strong non-GAAP operating earnings of $498 million in the fourth quarter and over $1.8 billion in 2021, a 35% increase compared to 2020.

“Overall, focused execution across our diversified portfolio of businesses drove strong results throughout the year. We’re executing on a clear strategy that will enable us to deliver on our financial targets, as demonstrated by last week’s agreement to reinsure our in-force U.S. retail fixed annuity and universal life insurance with secondary guarantee blocks of business,” said Houston. “We look forward to sustaining the momentum in 2022 and beyond and creating long term shareholder value along the way.”

Use of Non-GAAP financial measures 

The company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company’s financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.

*U.S. GAAP (GAAP) net income attributable to Principal Financial Group versus non-GAAP operating earnings 

Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings, which is a financial measure that excludes the effect of net realized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments the company believes are not indicative of overall operating trends, for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts. Note: it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of non-GAAP operating earnings enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the company’s businesses.
