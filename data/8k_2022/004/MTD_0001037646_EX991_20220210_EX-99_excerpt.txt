Outlook 

The Company stated that forecasting continues to be challenging. Management cautions that market conditions are dynamic and changes to the business environment can happen quickly. Uncertainty remains surrounding the impact of COVID-19 and the challenges in the global supply chain on the economic environment. The estimates include uncertainty and management acknowledges that market conditions are subject to change. 

The Company said that based on its assessment of market conditions today, management anticipates local

currency sales growth in 2022 will be approximately 7%. This sales growth is expected to result in

Adjusted EPS in the range of $38.15 to $38.50 which represents a growth rate of 12% to 13%. This compares with previous local currency sales guidance of approximately 6% and Adjusted EPS guidance of $37.25 to $37.65.

Based on today's assessment of market conditions, management anticipates local currency sales growth for the first quarter of 2022 will be approximately 10%, and Adjusted EPS is forecasted to be $7.25 to $7.35, a growth rate of 11% to 12%. 

While the Company has provided an outlook for local currency sales growth and Adjusted EPS, it has not provided an outlook for reported sales growth or EPS as it would require an estimate of currency exchange fluctuations and non-recurring items, which are not yet known. 

Conclusion

Kaltenbach concluded, "We continued to strengthen our competitive position in 2021. Innovation nourished our excellent product portfolio and comprehensive services offering, and combined with our Spinnaker sales and marketing strategies, helped us to capture growth opportunities. We successfully navigated challenges in the global supply chain to meet customer demands. Our culture of agility and execution further reinforced our brand while our strong results allowed us to make important investments for future growth. We also furthered our great track record on Environment, Social, and Governance initiatives by committing to establish science-based targets to drive greater reductions in our impact on the environment. While market conditions are currently good, challenges remain in the global supply chain and we remain cautious about COVID-19 and its ultimate impact on the global economy. We are confident in our strategic growth and margin initiatives and our ability to gain market share. We believe we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2022 and beyond."
