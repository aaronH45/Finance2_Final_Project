The Trading Plan is designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Trading Plan entered into by Mr. Ketchum authorizes a broker-dealer to purchase on behalf of Mr. Ketchum $1,000,000 of Common Stock on the open market or otherwise at prevailing market prices on or after July 1, 2022. In accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and the terms of the Trading Plan, Mr. Ketchum has no discretion or control over the timing or effectuation of purchases of the Common Stock that are made pursuant to the Trading Plan.

Mr. Ketchum directly and indirectly beneficially owns 97,164 shares of Common Stock.

The transactions executed in accordance with the Trading Plan will be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission through Form 4 filings pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act and in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake to report on specific Rule 10b5-1 trading plans that may be adopted by officers, directors, or other insiders of the Company in the future or to report any modifications or termination of any publicly announced trading plan.
