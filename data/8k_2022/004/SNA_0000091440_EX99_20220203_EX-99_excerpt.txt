As we have throughout the turbulence, we’ve utilized our Snap-on Value Creation Processes to expand our advantages in our products, our brands, and our people, which we believe will serve to drive continuing and substantial progress for the foreseeable future. Finally, I want to thank our franchisees and our associates worldwide for their valuable contributions, for their ongoing dedication, and for their confidence in our prospects as we move through 2022 and beyond.”  

 Segment Results - Fourth Quarter  

 Commercial & Industrial Group segment sales of $358.7 million in the quarter compared to $364.4 million last year, reflecting a $1.6 million, or 0.4%, organic sales decline and $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease is primarily due to lower sales to customers in critical industries. In addition, segment net sales in the period increased $5.8 million, or 1.6%, from $352.9 million in the pre-pandemic fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting a $6.7 million, or 1.9%, organic sales decline, offset by $8.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  

 Operating earnings of $50.1 million in the period, including $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $56.2 million in 2020. The operating margin (operating earnings as a percentage of segment sales) of 14.0% compared to 15.4% a year ago.  

 Snap-on Tools Group segment sales of $504.8 million in the quarter increased $9.9 million, or 2.0%, from 2020 levels, reflecting a $7.9 million, or 1.6%, organic sales gain and $2.0 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is due to higher activity in the U.S. franchise business, partially offset by a decrease in the segment’s international operations. Additionally, segment net sales in the period increased $93.1 million, or 22.6%, from $411.7 million in the pre-pandemic fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting an $89.2 million, or 21.5%, organic sales gain and $3.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation.

The organic gain is comprised of higher sales of undercar equipment and of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, partially offset by lower activity with OEM dealerships. In addition, segment net sales in the period increased $57.5 million, or 17.2%, from $335.0 million in the pre-pandemic fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting a $43.7 million, or 13.0%, organic sales gain, $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales, and $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation.

 Outlook  

 COVID-19, its subsequent variants, as well as related supply chain inefficiencies, continue to impact economic activity worldwide in 2022. Snap-on is accommodating to the virus-related turbulence and is capitalizing on opportunities in this mixed environment. The company believes that our markets and our operations possess and, indeed, have demonstrated considerable resilience against the impact of the virus and that there will be ongoing advancement even in the midst of the pandemic. The trajectory, however, may be uncertain due to the evolving nature and duration of the situation.  

 Snap-on expects to make continued progress in 2022 along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including extending in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In pursuit of these initiatives, it is projected that capital expenditures in 2022 will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million. Snap-on continues to respond to the global macroeconomic challenges through its Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) process and other cost reduction initiatives.  

 Snap-on currently anticipates that its full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.

 Non-GAAP Measures  

 References in this release to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), adjusted to exclude acquisition-related sales and the impact of foreign currency translation. Management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output, expanded customer base, geographic expansion, new product development and pricing changes, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. Organic sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in the company’s businesses and facilitates comparisons of its sales performance with prior periods.  

 For the fourth quarter of 2020, the company is including operating earnings before financial services, consolidated operating earnings, net earnings, diluted earnings per share and its effective tax rate, all as adjusted to exclude the impact of $1.0 million of restructuring charges ($1.0 million after tax) for exit and disposal activities.  

 For the full year 2020, the company is including operating earnings before financial services, consolidated operating earnings, net earnings, diluted earnings per share and its effective tax rate, all as adjusted to exclude the impact of $12.5 million of restructuring charges ($10.3 million after tax) for exit and disposal activities, which occurred in the first, second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020.  

 Management believes that adjusting these measures to exclude the restructuring charges provides more meaningful year-over-year comparisons of the company’s 2021 operating performance. For a reconciliation of the 2020 adjusted metrics, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
