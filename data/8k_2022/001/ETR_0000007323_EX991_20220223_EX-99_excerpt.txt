Business Segment Results

Utility

For full year 2021, the Utility business reported earnings attributable to Entergy Corporation of $1,490 million, or $7.38 per share, on an as-reported basis, and earnings of $1,464 million, or $7.25 per share, on an adjusted basis. This compared to full year 2020 earnings of $1,800 million, or $8.95 per share, on an as-reported basis, and earnings of $1,424 million, or $7.08 per share, on an adjusted basis. Drivers for the full year included: 

•the net effect of regulatory actions across the operating companies;

•higher retail sales volume; 

•various regulatory provisions; 

•higher operating expenses including other O&M, depreciation expense, and taxes other than income taxes; 

•higher interest expense, including lower AFUDC; and

•higher effective income tax rate (certain income tax items were considered adjustments and excluded from adjusted earnings).

On a per share basis, full year 2021 results reflected higher common shares outstanding.

Appendix C contains additional details on Utility operating and financial measures.

Parent & Other

For full year 2021, Parent & Other reported a loss attributable to Entergy Corporation of $(249 million), or $(1.23) per share, on an as-reported basis, and a loss of $(248 million), or $(1.23) per share, on an adjusted basis. This compared to a full year 2020 loss of $(347 million), or $(1.73) per share, on an as-reported basis, and a loss of $(286 million), or $(1.42) per share, on an adjusted basis. A primary driver for the full year change was income tax expense (certain income tax items were considered adjustments and excluded from adjusted earnings). This was partially offset by higher interest expense.

On a per share basis, full year 2021 results reflected higher common shares outstanding. 

Entergy Wholesale Commodities 

For full year 2021, EWC reported a loss attributable to Entergy Corporation of $(123 million), or (61) cents per share, on an as-reported basis. This compared to full year 2020 loss attributable to Entergy Corporation of $(65 million), or (32) cents per share, on an as-reported basis. Drivers for the year included:

•lower revenue primarily due to the shutdown of Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3; 

•higher asset write-offs and impairments due primarily to the loss on the sale of IPEC, partially offset by a gain from the settlement of spent fuel litigation at Indian Point; and

•absence of earnings on NDTs as a result of the transfer of the IPEC NDTs and decommissioning liabilities to Holtec.

These drivers were partially offset by:

•income tax items in 2021 and 2020; and

•lower operating expenses due to the shutdown of Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3.

Appendix D contains additional details on EWC operating and financial measures, including reconciliation for non-GAAP EWC adjusted EBITDA.

Earnings Per Share Guidance

Entergy initiated its 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.15 to $6.45. See webcast presentation for additional details.

The company has provided 2022 earnings guidance with regard to the non-GAAP measure of Entergy adjusted EPS. This measure excludes from the corresponding GAAP financial measure the effect of adjustments as described below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” The company has not provided a reconciliation of such non-GAAP guidance to guidance presented on a GAAP basis because it cannot predict and quantify with a reasonable degree of confidence all of the adjustments that may occur during the period. One such adjustment will be the exclusion of EWC earnings from Entergy adjusted EPS. We currently estimate that the contribution of EWC to Entergy’s as-reported EPS will be approximately 15 cents in 2022. This estimate is subject to substantial uncertainty due to, among other things, the potential effects of exiting the EWC business.

Our approximately 12,500 employees are dedicated to powering life today and for future generations. 

Entergy Corporation’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Chicago under the symbol “ETR”.

Details regarding Entergy’s results of operations, regulatory proceedings, and other matters are available in this earnings release, a copy of which will be filed with the SEC, and the webcast presentation. Both documents are available on Entergy’s Investor Relations website at www.entergy.com/investor_relations. 

Entergy maintains a web page as part of its Investor Relations website, entitled Regulatory and Other Information, which provides investors with key updates on certain regulatory proceedings and important milestones on the execution of its strategy. While some of this information may be considered material information, investors should not rely exclusively on this page for all relevant company information.

For definitions of certain operating measures, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and abbreviations and acronyms used in the earnings release materials, see Appendix F. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This news release contains non-GAAP financial measures, which are generally numerical measures of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that either exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within this news release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 

Entergy reports earnings using the non-GAAP measure of Entergy adjusted earnings, which excludes the effect of certain “adjustments,” including the removal of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment in light of the company’s exit from the merchant power business. Adjustments are unusual or non-recurring items or events or other items or events that management believes do not reflect the ongoing business of Entergy, such as the results of the EWC segment, significant tax items, and other items such as certain costs, expenses, or other specified items. In addition to reporting GAAP consolidated earnings on a per share basis, Entergy reports its adjusted earnings on a per share basis. These per share measures represent the applicable earnings amount divided by the diluted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share for, among other things, financial planning and analysis; reporting financial results to the board of directors, employees, stockholders, analysts, and investors; and internal evaluation of financial performance. Entergy believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy’s business, comparing period to period results, and comparing Entergy’s financial performance to the financial performance of other companies in the utility sector.

Other non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA; adjusted ROE; adjusted ROE, excluding affiliate preferred; gross liquidity; net liquidity; net liquidity, including storm escrows; debt to capital, excluding securitization debt; net debt to net capital, excluding securitization debt; parent debt to total debt, excluding securitization debt; FFO to debt, excluding securitization debt; and FFO to debt, excluding securitization debt, return of unprotected excess ADIT, and severance and retention payments associated with exit of EWC, are measures Entergy uses internally for management and board discussions and to gauge the overall strength of its business. Entergy believes the above data provides useful information to investors in evaluating Entergy’s ongoing financial results and flexibility, 

 (more) 

Entergy Reports 2021 Earnings 

February 23, 2022

Page 5 

and assists investors in comparing Entergy’s credit and liquidity to the credit and liquidity of others in the utility sector. In addition, other financial measures including FFO are included on both an adjusted and an as-reported basis. In each case, the metrics defined as “adjusted” (other than EWC’s adjusted EBITDA) exclude the effect of adjustments as defined above. EWC’s adjusted EBITDA represents EWC’s earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, and also excludes decommissioning expense.

These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of Entergy’s operations that, when viewed with Entergy’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Entergy’s business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Investors are strongly encouraged to review Entergy’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Although certain of these measures are intended to assist investors in comparing Entergy’s performance to other companies in the utility sector, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it might not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

Calculations may differ due to rounding

(a)Per share amounts are calculated by dividing the corresponding earnings (loss) by the diluted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

See Appendix B for detailed earnings variance analysis.

Appendix A-2 and Appendix A-3 list adjustments by business. Adjustments are included in as-reported earnings consistent with GAAP but are excluded from adjusted earnings. As a result, adjusted earnings is considered a non-GAAP measure.

Appendix A-4 provides a comparative summary of OCF by business. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Calculations may differ due to rounding

OCF decreased quarter-over-quarter due primarily to higher fuel and purchased power payments at the Utility and higher income tax payments. The decrease was partially offset by higher collections from Utility customers and lower pension contributions.

OCF decreased year-over-year due primarily to higher fuel and purchased power payments, non-capital storm restoration spending, higher income tax payments, lower EWC revenues, higher EWC severance and retention payments, the non-capital portion of proceeds from the DOE regarding spent fuel litigation, and higher pension contributions. The decrease was partially offset by higher collections from Utility customers and lower spending on nuclear refueling outages.

For the quarter and the full year, intercompany income tax payments contributed to the line of business variances.

B: Earnings Variance Analysis 

Appendix B-1 and Appendix B-2 provide details of current quarter and full year 2021 versus 2020 as-reported and adjusted earnings per share variances for Utility, Parent & Other, and EWC.

(c)Utility operating revenue / regulatory charges (credits)–net and Utility income taxes–other exclude $16 million in fourth quarter 2021 and $13 million in fourth quarter 2020 for the return of unprotected excess ADIT to customers (net effect is neutral to earnings). On a full year basis, Utility operating revenue / regulatory charges (credits)–net and Utility income taxes–other exclude $88 million in 2021 and $74 million in 2020 for the return of unprotected excess ADIT to customers (net effect is neutral to earnings).

(d)EPS effect is calculated by multiplying the pre-tax amount by the estimated income tax rate that is expected to apply and dividing by diluted average number of common shares outstanding for the prior period; income taxes–other represents income tax differences other than the tax effect of individual line items.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(e)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases were driven by regulatory actions including E-AR’s FRP; E-LA’s FRP (including riders); E-MS’s FRP; E-NO’s FRP (electric and gas); and E-TX’s GCRR, TCRF, and DCRF. The variances also reflected other items: regulatory charges (credits)–net for the difference between decommissioning expenses and NDT earnings plus decommissioning costs collected in revenue (largely earnings neutral, offset in Utility other income (deductions)–other); regulatory charges (credits)–net to account for timing differences which result from HLBV accounting for the equity partnership for E-AR’s Searcy Solar plant (offset in Utility noncontrolling interest); regulatory provisions for E-AR and E-MS’s FRPs; a regulatory liability for tax sharing with E-LA customers (partially offsets the hurricanes Katrina and Rita Act 55 income tax item discussed in footnote p) and higher Grand Gulf revenue. For the full year, volume/weather contributed to the increase. For the quarter, volume/weather partially offset the increase. The full year variance also reflected recovery of LCPS, the reversal of the 4Q20 regulatory provision for E-AR’s 2019 netting adjustment in 1Q21, a first quarter 2020 regulatory liability for tax sharing with E-LA customers (partially offsets the Hurricane Isaac Act 55 income tax item discussed in footnote p), and a reserve adjustment for the FERC MSS-4 ROE decision.

(f)The fourth quarter and full year earnings decreases were due largely to lower revenues from the shutdown of Indian Point 3 in April 2021. The full year decrease also reflected the shutdown of Indian Point 2 in April 2020.

(g)The fourth quarter and full year earnings decreases from higher Utility other O&M were primarily due to higher MISO expenses, higher contract costs related to new customer solutions and sustainability initiatives, and higher compensation and benefits costs. The full year variance also reflected higher distribution operations expenses, an increase in non-nuclear generation expenses due primarily to new plants placed in service, higher nuclear generation costs, reduced expenses resulting from receipt of proceeds from spent fuel litigation with the DOE, and lower nuclear insurance refunds; these were partially offset by a decrease in meter reading expenses as a result of AMI meter deployment and a $15M pre-tax gain on the sale of an asset (considered an adjustment and excluded from adjusted earnings).

(h)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases from lower EWC other O&M were due largely to the shutdown of Indian Point 3 in April 2021 and lower severance and retention costs. The full year increase also reflected the shutdown of Indian Point 2 in April 2020. 

(i)The fourth quarter earnings increase from lower EWC asset write-offs and impairments was primarily due to a gain from the settlement of spent fuel litigation at Indian Point. The full year earnings decrease from higher EWC asset write-offs and impairments also reflected a $340 million ($268 million net-of-tax) loss which resulted from the sale of Indian Point in May 2021. 

(j)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases from lower EWC decommissioning expense were due to the sale of Indian Point in May 2021. 

(k)The fourth quarter and full year earnings decreases from higher Utility taxes other than income taxes were due to higher franchise taxes and higher ad valorem taxes. 

(l)The fourth quarter and full year earnings decreases from higher Utility depreciation expense were due primarily to higher plant in service, including MCPS and WPEC. The full year decrease also reflected LCPS. 

(m)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases from lower EWC depreciation expense were due primarily to the shutdown of Indian Point 3 in April 2021. The full year variance also reflected the shutdown of Indian Point 2 in April 2020.

(n)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases from higher Utility other income (deductions)–other were due largely to differences in NDT returns (based on regulatory treatment, decommissioning-related variances are largely earnings 

neutral, as described in footnote e), partially offset by the change in AFUDC as a result of higher construction work in progress in 2020. 

(o)The fourth quarter and full year earnings decreases from lower EWC other income (deductions)–other were due largely to the absence of earnings from NDTs that were transferred in the sale of Indian Point, partially offset by lower non-service pension costs. 

(p)The fourth quarter and full year earnings decreases from Utility income taxes-other reflected three fourth quarter 2021 tax items and two fourth quarter 2020 tax items. In the fourth quarter 2021, Louisiana and Arkansas enacted corporate income tax rate changes resulting in a $29 million decrease in income tax expense. Also, in the fourth quarter 2021, an $8 million valuation allowance was recorded as a result of incurring storm restoration costs which impaired the realizability of certain net operating loss carryovers and a $5 million provision was recorded for an uncertain tax position associated with net operating losses from prior years. The portion of these three items that related to prior years was considered an adjustment and excluded from adjusted earnings. In fourth quarter 2020, a settlement of the 2014 / 2015 IRS audit resulted in a $396 million tax benefit (classified as an adjustment), as well as a $31 million tax benefit related to Act 55 financing of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita costs (partly offset by customer sharing, recorded as a regulatory charge discussed in footnote e). The full year decrease also reflected an IRS settlement related to Act 55 financing of Hurricane Isaac costs (partly offset by customer sharing, discussed in footnote e) and an annual tax accrual related to stock-based compensation which resulted in a $22 million income tax benefit in first quarter 2020.

(q)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases from Parent & Other income taxes–other related primarily to a fourth quarter 2020 settlement of the 2014 / 2015 IRS audit, which resulted in a $61 million income tax expense (considered an adjustment and excluded from adjusted earnings). The full year increase also reflected the reversal of a $9 million valuation allowance related to the interest expense limitation in second quarter 2021 as well as $23 million of income tax expense recorded in first quarter 2020 as a result of the IRS settlement (discussed in footnote p) related to the Hurricane Isaac Act 55 financing. 

(r)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases from EWC income taxes related primarily to a fourth quarter 2020 settlement of the 2014 / 2015 IRS audit, which resulted in a $104 million income tax expense. 

(s)The fourth quarter and full year earnings increases from Utility preferred dividend requirements and noncontrolling interest resulted from HLBV accounting for the noncontrolling interest partner of the tax equity partnership for Searcy Solar (offset by a regulatory provision).

(t)The full year earnings increase from lower EWC taxes other than income taxes was due primarily to the shutdown of Indian Point 2 in April 2020 and Indian Point 3 in April 2021. 

(u)The full year earnings decrease from higher Utility interest expense was due primarily to higher debt balances at E-LA and E-MS, as well as the change in AFUDC as a result of higher construction work in progress in 2020.

(v)The full year earnings decrease from higher Parent & Other interest expense was driven by debt issuances at Entergy Corporation, which resulted in a higher debt balance and additional debt issuance costs.

C: Utility Operating and Financial Measures 

Appendix C provides comparative summaries of Utility operating and financial measures.

(w)The effects of weather were estimated using heating degree days and cooling degree days for the billing cycles from certain locations within each jurisdiction and comparing to “normal” weather based on 20-year historical data. The models used to estimate weather are updated periodically and are subject to change.

On a weather-adjusted basis for fourth quarter 2021, retail billed sales increased 3.0 percent, including estimated hurricane impacts of (0.8) percent. Residential billed sales decreased (3.8) percent and commercial billed sales increased 1.1 percent. Industrial billed sales increased 8.9 percent primarily reflecting growth from new customers, new/expansion projects, and an increase in demand from cogeneration customers.

On a weather-adjusted basis for full year 2021, retail billed sales increased 2.0 percent, including the impacts from COVID-19 and hurricanes. Residential billed sales decreased (1.8) percent and commercial billed sales increased 0.9 percent. Industrial billed sales volume increased 5.7 percent reflecting an increase in demand from new/expansion projects - primarily in the metals, transportation, and chemicals industries - and an increase in demand from cogeneration customers.
