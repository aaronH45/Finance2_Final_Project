Item 8.01 Other Events.

On January 28, 2022, Johnson & Johnson (the Company) determined that it will record an intangible asset impairment charge related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year 2020.

Additional information regarding efficacy through the clinical trial became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for AD. The resulting non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $610 million will be reflected in the Company’s fiscal first quarter 2022 financial results and will be excluded for purposes of adjusted earnings. Following this impairment charge, bermekimab will retain a carrying value of approximately $150 million relating to the HS indication.

A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in Johnson & Johnson’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, including in the sections captioned “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A.
