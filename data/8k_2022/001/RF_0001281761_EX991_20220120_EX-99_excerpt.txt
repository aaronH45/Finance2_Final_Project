SUMMARY OF FULL-YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER 2021 RESULTS:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Based on income taxes at an approximate 25% incremental rate. Second quarter of 2021 bank-owned life insurance claim is tax free. 

** Items impacting results or trends during the period, but are not considered non-GAAP adjustments. These items generally include market-related measures, impacts of new accounting guidance, or event driven actions.

*** Fourth quarter and full-year 2021 amounts include $145 million for the initial allowance for non-purchased credit deteriorated acquired EnerBank loans. Full-year 2020 includes $64 million for the initial allowance for non-purchased credit deteriorated acquired Ascentium loans. 

**** Interest income for the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans includes estimated funding costs.

Non-GAAP adjusted items(1) impacting the company's earnings are identified to assist investors in analyzing Regions' operating results on the same basis as that applied by management and provide a basis to predict future performance. Non-GAAP adjusted items(1) in the current quarter reflect, among other items, approximately $15 million in professional fees and related costs associated with the company's fourth quarter acquisitions.

 Total revenue

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not Meaningful

* These market value adjustments relate to assets held for employee benefits that are offset within salaries and employee benefits expense.

Total revenue of approximately $1.6 billion increased 1 percent on both a reported and an adjusted basis(1) compared to the third quarter of 2021. Net interest income increased 6 percent compared to the third quarter driven primarily by the EnerBank acquisition and higher Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) forgiveness income. Excluding these items and a large interest recovery in the third quarter, net interest income remained stable. Loan growth and hedging income offset pressure on asset yields from the low interest rate environment. Strong deposit growth trends continued, and cash balances rose to new record levels, negatively impacting the reported net interest margin. Excluding the impact of PPP interest income and excess cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, the company's adjusted net interest margin(1) increased 4 basis points to 3.34 percent, attributable mostly to the EnerBank acquisition.

4

Non-interest income decreased 5 percent on both a reported and an adjusted basis(1) compared to the third quarter of 2021. Wealth management increased 5 percent compared to the prior quarter driven by higher investment management & trust fees. Service charges reflected a seasonal increase of 2 percent while mortgage income and card & ATM fees remained relatively stable. Capital markets income decreased 5 percent during the fourth quarter; however, 2021 represents the company's highest annual capital markets income since it began rebuilding its capital markets business in 2014. Other non-interest income declined 33 percent primarily due to an increase in the value of certain equity investments and the sale of certain small dollar equipment loans and leases during the prior quarter. 

Non-interest expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not Meaningful

Non-interest expense increased 5 percent on both a reported and an adjusted basis(1) compared to the third quarter of 2021 and includes the impact of the company's EnerBank, Sabal Capital Partners, and Clearsight Advisors acquisitions, which closed during the fourth quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 4 percent, driven primarily by higher incentive compensation and base salaries, as well as some inflationary pressures. Full-time equivalent associate headcount increased by approximately 660 positions during the quarter driven primarily by acquisitions, but also reflects key hires to support strategic initiatives within other revenue-producing businesses. Elevated incentive compensation is due primarily to exceptionally strong 2021 performance, including credit. Most other expense categories also increased during the quarter, but were partially offset by a loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred during the prior quarter. 

5

The company's fourth quarter efficiency ratio was 59.8 percent on a reported basis and 58.8 percent on an adjusted basis(1). The effective tax rate was 18.9 percent and includes a discrete income tax benefit related to state income tax true-ups.

Loans and Leases

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not meaningful.

Average loans and leases increased 4 percent compared to the prior quarter and includes the benefit of approximately $3 billion in acquired loan balances associated with the company's fourth quarter EnerBank acquisition. Excluding the acquired EnerBank loans, average loans and leases increased modestly. Excluding the company's consumer exit portfolios, as well as outstanding PPP loans, adjusted average and ending loans and leases(1) increased approximately 6 percent and 7 percent respectively. Adjusted average business lending(1) increased 2 percent led by growth in corporate and middle market lending across asset-based lending, healthcare, government, transportation, and technology and defense. While still below pre-pandemic levels, commercial loan line utilization levels ended the quarter at approximately 42.3 percent, increasing 240 basis points over the prior quarter. Loan production continues to be strong with year-to-date loan commitment growth of approximately $4.7 billion. Adjusted average consumer lending(1) increased 12 percent attributable primarily to the EnerBank acquisition, but also reflects growth in residential first mortgage and consumer credit card partially offset by declines in consumer exit portfolios and home equity lending. 

6

Deposits 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total average deposit balances increased 4 percent to a new record high in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding approximately $2.7 billion of acquired EnerBank deposits, which are included in Other deposits, total average deposits increased 2 percent. Consumer, Corporate, and Wealth Management deposits all increased compared to the third quarter. 

Asset quality[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Excludes guaranteed residential first mortgages that are 90+ days past due and still accruing. 

** Business services represents the combined total of commercial and investor real estate loans.

This quarter's provision includes $145 million related to the initial allowance for non-purchased credit 

7

deteriorated loans acquired from EnerBank; the acquisition closed on Oct. 1, 2021. Continued improvements in the economic outlook and positive credit performance partially offset the initial EnerBank allowance resulting in a net $110 million provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2021. The resulting allowance for credit losses was equal to 1.79 percent of total loans and 349 percent of total non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale. Annualized net charge-offs increased 6 basis points to 0.20 percent of average loans during the fourth quarter and included the impact from the EnerBank acquisition. Full-year 2021 net charge-offs were 24 basis points representing the company's lowest level since 2006. Total non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, and total business services criticized loans improved during the quarter. Overall asset quality continues to reflect broad-based improvement across most commercial and consumer loan portfolios, as well as elevated recoveries associated with strong collateral asset values. 

Capital and liquidity[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Tangible common book value per share includes the impact of quarterly earnings and changes to market value adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income, as well as continued capital returns.

Regions maintains a solid capital position as estimated capital ratios remain well above current regulatory requirements. The Tier 1(2) and Common Equity Tier 1(2) ratios were estimated at 11 percent and 9.5 percent respectively at quarter-end. 

During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 12.8 million shares of common stock for a total of $300 million through open market purchases and declared $160 million in dividends to common shareholders.

Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the statements are made. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, and because they also relate to the future they are likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those described below:

•Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values, increases in unemployment rates, financial market disruptions and potential reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and conditions.

•Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.

•Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity.

•The impact of pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on our businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions. The duration and severity of any pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt the global economy, adversely affect our capital and liquidity position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and increase our allowance for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result in lost revenue or additional expenses. 

•Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets, or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to changes in tax law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit or other factors.

•The effect of new tax legislation and/or interpretation of existing tax law, which may impact our earnings, capital ratios, and our ability to return capital to shareholders.

•Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating leases.

•Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.

•Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those securities.

•Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.

•Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits, which could adversely affect our net income.

•Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional financial services companies, including fintechs, some of whom possess greater financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory standards than we are.

•Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and services to meet customers’ needs and respond to emerging technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our revenue.

•Our inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could result in losing business to competitors.

•Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, including as a result of the changes in U.S. presidential administration, control of the U.S. Congress, and changes in personnel at the bank regulatory agencies, which could require us to change certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.

•Our capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases, or redemptions of preferred stock, must not cause us to fall below minimum capital ratio requirements, with applicable buffers taken into account, and must comply with other requirements and restrictions under law or imposed by our regulators, which may impact our ability to return capital to shareholders.

•Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements (as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance of such tests and requirements.

•Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements (including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards), including our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition and market perceptions of us could be negatively impacted.

•The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our subsidiaries.

•The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition or divestiture of businesses, including our recently completed acquisitions of EnerBank, Sabal Capital Partners, and Clearsight Advisors, and risks related to such acquisitions, including that the expected synergies, cost savings and other financial or other benefits may not be realized within the expected timeframes, or might be less than projected; difficulties in integrating the businesses; and the inability of Regions to effectively cross-sell products following these acquisitions.

•Market replacement of LIBOR and the related effect on our LIBOR-based financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, derivative products, debt obligations, deposits, investments, and loans.

•The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary information, increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, and cause losses.

•Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries, in particular Regions Bank, could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.

•Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analyses relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove incorrect.

•The effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above.

•Other risks identified from time to time in reports that we file with the SEC.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

Management uses pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP) and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP), as well as the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the fee income ratio. Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) and adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP) are used to determine adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) as a percentage of total loans is an important ratio, especially during periods of economic stress. Management believes this ratio provides investors with meaningful additional information about credit loss allowance levels when the impact of SBA's Paycheck Protection Program loans, which are fully backed by the U.S. government, and any related allowance are excluded from total loans and total allowance which are the denominator and numerator, respectively, used in the ACL ratio. This adjusted ACL ratio represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

Tangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.

Management and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentation to investors of company performance

•Metrics for incentive compensation
