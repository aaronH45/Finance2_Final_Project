CEO Commentary

"Fifth Third has continued to deliver strong financial results while fully supporting our customers, communities, and employees. Results for the quarter reflected strong business momentum in most of our businesses, resulting in improved and diversified revenues. Net interest income excluding the impact of PPP increased 2% sequentially, benefiting from robust C&I loan growth while continuing to be disciplined in managing our excess cash position. We generated record commercial banking and wealth and asset management revenue, while mortgage revenue was impacted by environmental factors and our decision to retain a portion of our salable production. We expect the positive momentum in our businesses to carry forward into 2022 and beyond.

We had yet another quarter of benign credit results, resulting in a full year net charge-off ratio of just 16 basis points. Additionally, non-performing loans and commercial criticized assets continued to improve. 

We took action in recognition of the extraordinary efforts made by our front-line employees throughout the pandemic by making a special COVID staffing bonus totaling $10 million in the fourth quarter.

We continue to focus on growing strong relationships and managing the balance sheet with a through-the-cycle perspective to generate sustainable long-term value and continue our position as a top performing regional bank."

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compared to the prior quarter, NII increased $8 million, or 1%, primarily due to higher commercial & industrial (C&I) loan balances, seasonal mutual fund dividends and elevated prepayment penalties received in the investment portfolio, and a reduction in long-term debt, partially offset by lower yields on C&I loan balances due to continued spread compression and lower PPP-related income. PPP-related interest income was $36 million compared to $47 million in the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP-related income, NII increased $19 million, or 2%, sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, reported NIM decreased 4 bps, primarily due to a $2.6 billion increase in other short-term investments (primarily interest-bearing cash) and lower yields on C&I loans, partially offset by the aforementioned seasonal mutual fund dividends and elevated prepayment penalties received in the investment portfolio. Underlying NIM(g) decreased 1 bp sequentially. Excess liquidity and PPP had a negative impact on reported NIM of approximately 47 bps in the current quarter, compared to 44 bps in the prior quarter. 

Compared to the year-ago quarter, NII increased $15 million, or 1%, primarily reflecting the benefit of GNMA forbearance loan buyout purchases, a reduction in long-term debt, higher indirect secured consumer loan balances, and lower deposit costs, partially offset by lower home equity, C&I, and construction balances as well as the impact of lower market rates. Compared to the year-ago quarter, reported NIM decreased 3 bps, primarily reflecting loan spread compression and lower market rates, partially offset by PPP-related income and lower long-term debt and deposit costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compared to the prior quarter, total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1%, reflecting an increase in both commercial loan and lease balances and consumer loans. Average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 2%, primarily reflecting growth in C&I loans which increased 4% (or 7% excluding the impact of PPP loans). Average consumer portfolio loans increased 1%, as higher indirect secured consumer loans were partially offset by lower home equity and other consumer loan balances. 

Compared to the year-ago quarter, total average portfolio loans and leases were flat, as an increase in consumer loans was offset by lower commercial loans and leases.

Average consumer portfolio loans increased 5%, as higher indirect secured consumer loans were partially offset by lower home equity and credit card balances.

Average loans and leases held for sale were $5 billion in the current quarter compared to $6 billion in the prior quarter and $2 billion in the year-ago quarter. The increase from the year-ago quarter was primarily attributable to the aforementioned GNMA forbearance loan buyout purchases within consumer loans held for sale (approximately $4.7 billion purchased since December 2020, including $0.7 billion in October 2021).

Average commercial transaction deposits increased 5% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 2%.

Compared to the year-ago quarter, average core deposits increased 6%, reflecting ongoing impacts of fiscal and monetary stimulus combined with success in generating consumer household growth, partially offset by the HSA deposit sale finalized near the end of the third quarter of 2021.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to GAAP measures, management considers various non-GAAP measures when evaluating the performance of the business, including: ânet interest income (FTE),â âinterest income (FTE),â ânet interest margin (FTE),â ânet interest rate spread (FTE),â âincome before income taxes (FTE),â âtangible net income available to common shareholders,â âaverage tangible common equity,â âreturn on average tangible common equity,â âtangible common equity (excluding AOCI),â âtangible common equity (including AOCI),â âtangible equity,â âtangible book value per share,â âadjusted noninterest income,â ânoninterest income excluding certain items,â âadjusted noninterest expense,â ânoninterest expense excluding certain items,â âpre-provision net revenue,â âadjusted efficiency ratio,â âadjusted return on average common equity,â âadjusted return on average tangible common equity,â âadjusted return on average tangible common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income,â âunderlying net interest margin,â âadjusted pre-provision net revenue,â âadjusted return on average assets,â âefficiency ratio (FTE),â âtotal revenue (FTE),â ânoninterest income as a percent of total revenueâ, and certain ratios derived from these measures. The Bancorp believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by the Fifth Third management team to evaluate operating performance and to make day-to-day operating decisions.

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and net interest margin as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.

The Bancorp believes tangible net income available to common shareholders, average tangible common equity, tangible common equity (excluding AOCI), tangible common equity (including AOCI), tangible equity, tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity are important measures for evaluating the performance of the business without the impacts of intangible items, whether acquired or created internally, in a manner comparable to other companies in the industry who present similar measures. 

The Bancorp believes noninterest income, noninterest expense, net interest income, net interest margin, pre-provision net revenue, efficiency ratio, noninterest income as a percent of total revenue, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, and return on average assets are important measures that adjust for significant, unusual, or large transactions that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance and enhances comparability of results with prior periods. 

The Bancorp believes noninterest income excluding certain items and noninterest expense excluding certain items are important measures that adjust for certain components that are prone to significant period-to-period changes in order to facilitate the explanation of variances in the noninterest income and noninterest expense line items.

Management considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity and tangible common equity (including and excluding AOCI), in addition to capital ratios defined by U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that providing the tangible common equity ratio excluding AOCI on certain assets and liabilities enables investors and others to assess the Bancorpâs use of equity without the effects of changes in AOCI, some of which are uncertain; providing the tangible common equity ratio including AOCI enables investors and others to assess the Bancorpâs use of equity if components of AOCI, such as unrealized gains or losses, were to be monetized.

Please note that although non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight, they should not be considered in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for analysis using GAAP measures. 

Please see reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, beginning on the following page.
