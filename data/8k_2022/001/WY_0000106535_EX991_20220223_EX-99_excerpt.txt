February 23, 2022  

SEATTLE, February 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ — Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) (“Weyerhaeuser,” “we” or “our”) today announced that it has commenced cash tender offers (each, an “Offer” and collectively, the “Offers”) for the maximum principal amount of validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) notes set forth below (the “Notes”), such that the aggregate purchase price, not including accrued and unpaid interest, payable in respect of such Notes will not exceed $1.0 billion.  

The Offers are being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated February 23, 2022 (the “Offer to Purchase”), which sets forth a description of the terms of the Offers.  

A summary of the Offers to purchase the Notes is outlined below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  

Weyerhaeuser is offering to accept the maximum principal amount of validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) Notes in the Offer for which the aggregate purchase price, not including accrued and unpaid interest, does not exceed $1.0 billion using a “waterfall” methodology under which Weyerhaeuser will accept the Notes in order of their respective Acceptance Priority Levels (as defined below).  

 (2)  

The applicable page on Bloomberg from which the Lead Dealer Managers (as defined below) for the Offers will quote the bid side prices of the applicable Reference Treasury Security (as defined below) is FIT1. The Total Consideration (as defined below) for Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to or at the Early Tender Time (as defined below) and accepted for purchase is calculated using the applicable fixed spread as described in the Offer to Purchase. The Early Tender Premium (as defined below) of $50 per $1,000 principal amount is included in the Total Consideration for each series of Notes set forth above and does not constitute an additional or increased payment. Holders of Notes will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on Notes accepted for purchase up to, but excluding, the Early Settlement Date or the Final Settlement Date (each as defined below), as applicable.  

 (3)  

Denotes a series of Notes for which the Notes were issued in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The remaining series of Notes were issued in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.  

 *  

Denotes a series of Notes for which the calculation of the applicable Total Consideration may be performed, subject to market practice, using the present value of such Notes as determined at the Price Determination Time (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) as if the principal amount of Notes had been due on the applicable Par Call Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) of such series rather than the maturity date.   

Each Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 22, 2022, unless extended or earlier terminated by Weyerhaeuser (such date and time, as the same may be extended or earlier terminated with respect to each Offer, the “Expiration Time”). To receive the Total Consideration, holders of the Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 8, 2022, unless such deadline is extended with respect to the applicable Offer(s) (such date and time, as the same may be extended with respect to each Offer, the “Early Tender Time”), to be eligible to receive the Total Consideration. Tenders of Notes may not be validly withdrawn after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 8, 2022 (the “Withdrawal Deadline”), unless extended by Weyerhaeuser with respect to the applicable Offer. After such time, Notes validly tendered may not be validly withdrawn unless such deadline is extended with respect to the applicable Offer, except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law. Payments for Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for purchase at or prior to the Early Tender Time are expected to settle on March 10, 2022 (the “Early Settlement Date”).  

The consideration paid in each of the Offers will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to a fixed spread over the yield to maturity of the applicable U.S. Treasury Security (the “Reference Treasury Security”) specified in the table above and on the cover page of the Offer to Purchase in the column entitled “Reference U.S. Treasury Security.” Holders who validly tender and do not validly withdraw Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Time that are accepted for purchase will be eligible to receive the “Total Consideration,” which includes an early tender premium of $50 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase (the “Early Tender Premium”). The Early Tender Premium is included in the Total Consideration for each series of Notes, and does not constitute an additional or increased payment. Holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Time but at or prior to the Expiration Time and whose Notes are accepted for purchase will be entitled to receive the Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Premium. In addition, in each case, holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will receive accrued and unpaid interest on their Notes up to, but excluding, the applicable settlement date, payable on the settlement date.  

Weyerhaeuser will accept for purchase for cash the maximum principal amount of validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) Notes for which the aggregate purchase price, not including accrued and unpaid interest, payable in respect of such Notes does not exceed $1.0 billion (the “Offer Cap”). Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offers, Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to or at the Early Tender Time will be accepted based on the acceptance priority levels noted in the table above (the “Acceptance Priority Levels”). All Notes tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time, regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels of the Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time. Subject to applicable law, Weyerhaeuser may increase, decrease or waive the Offer Cap, as provided in the Offer to Purchase.  

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offers, the “Acceptance Priority Procedures” will operate as follows: (1) at the Early Settlement Date, Weyerhaeuser will accept for purchase all validly tendered Notes of each series validly tendered at or before the Early Tender Time and not validly withdrawn at or before the Withdrawal Deadline, starting with the 8.500% Debentures due 2025 (which have an Acceptance Priority Level of 1), followed by the 7.950% Debentures due 2025 (which have an Acceptance Priority Level of 2), followed by the 7.850% Debentures due 2026 (which have an Acceptance Priority Level of 3), followed by the 7.125% Debentures due 2023 (which have an Acceptance Priority Level of 4), followed by the 7.375% Debentures due 2032 (which have an Acceptance Priority Level of 5), followed by the 7.350% Debentures due 2026 (which have an Acceptance Priority Level of 6), followed by the 6.950% Debentures due 2027 (which have an Acceptance Priority Level of 7), followed by the 6.875% Debentures due 2033 (which have an Acceptance Priority Level of 8), followed by the 4.000% Notes due 2030 (which have an Acceptance Priority Level of 9), followed by the 4.000% Notes due 2029 (which have an Acceptance Priority Level of 10), subject to the Offer Cap; and (2) on March 24, 2022 (the “Final Settlement Date”), to the extent Weyerhaeuser has not already accepted Notes with an aggregate purchase price payable in respect of such Notes equal to the Offer Cap, it will accept for purchase validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes of each series not previously purchased on the Early Settlement Date starting the 8.500% Debentures due 2025, followed by the 7.950% Debentures due 2025, followed by the 7.850% Debentures due 2026, followed by the 7.125% Debentures due 2023, followed by the 7.375% Debentures due 2032, followed by the 7.350% Debentures due 2026, followed by the 6.950% Debentures due 2027, followed by the 6.875% Debentures due 2033, followed by the 4.000% Notes due 2030, followed by the 4.000% Notes due 2029 in accordance with their respective Acceptance Priority Levels, subject to the Offer Cap.   

None of the Offers is conditioned on any of the other Offers or upon any minimum principal amount of Notes of any series being tendered. Weyerhaeuser’s obligation to purchase, and to pay for, any Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Offers is subject to and conditioned upon the satisfaction of, or Weyerhaeuser’s waiver of, the conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, including the successful completion of Weyerhaeuser’s concurrent offerings of notes.
