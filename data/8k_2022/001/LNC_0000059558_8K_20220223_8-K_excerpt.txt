Other Events.  

On February 23, 2022, Lincoln National Corporation (the “Company” or “we”) entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.400% Senior Notes due 2032 (the “Notes”) in a public offering (the “Offering”).  

The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The description of the Underwriting Agreement set forth above is qualified by reference to the Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.  

From time to time, in the ordinary course of their business, certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various financial advisory, investment banking, commercial banking or investment management services to us and our affiliates, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. In addition, the Underwriters and their affiliates may, from time to time, engage in transactions with or perform services for us in the ordinary course of business, including acting as distributors of various life, annuity, defined contribution and investment products of our subsidiaries. From time to time, certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates may effect transactions for their own account or the account of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in our debt or equity securities or loans, and may do so in the future.  

On March 1, 2022, the Company completed the Offering at a price to the public of 99.815%.  

We intend to use the net proceeds from the Offering for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of debt on or prior to its maturity.  

The Offering was completed pursuant to the Prospectus, filed as a part of the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3, dated September 25, 2020 (the “Form S-3”), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement in preliminary form dated February 23, 2022 and in final form dated February 23, 2022, and a free writing prospectus dated February 23, 2022. The Notes were sold to the Underwriters with underwriting discounts of 0.650%. The Notes were issued under the Senior Indenture, dated as of March 10, 2009, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 18, 2020, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (together, the “Senior Indenture”).  

The Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured debt obligations, and rank equally with all of the Company’s other present and future unsecured unsubordinated obligations. The Notes bear interest at a per-annum rate of 3.400%. The Company will make interest payments on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2022. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.  

The Notes will mature on March 1, 2032. However, prior to December 1, 2031 (three months prior to their maturity date) (the “Par Call Date”), we may redeem the Notes at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the Notes matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the final prospectus supplement) plus 25 basis points less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption, and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. On or after the Par Call Date, we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.  

The Senior Indenture contains customary events of default. If an event of default exists under the Senior Indenture, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of all of the Notes, together with accrued interest, if any, to be immediately due and payable.   

The foregoing summary of the terms of the Notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of (i) the Senior Indenture, incorporated by reference in Exhibits 4.1 and 4.4 to the Form S-3; and (ii) the form of the Notes, attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.  

This report is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy or an invitation to purchase or subscribe for any securities or the solicitation of any vote in any jurisdiction, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
