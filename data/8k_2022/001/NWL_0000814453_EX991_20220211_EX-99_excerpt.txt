Newell Brands Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results

Q4 Net Sales Growth 4.3%; Core Sales Growth 5.8%

Q4 Diluted EPS $0.22; Normalized Diluted EPS $0.42

Q4 Net Sales, Operating Profit and EPS Exceed Outlook

Provides Initial Outlook for Full Year 2022

ATLANTA, GA – February 11, 2022 – Newell Brands (NASDAQ: NWL) today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. 

"We achieved an important milestone in 2021, as we returned the company to core sales growth, with strong results across each business unit and geographic region,” said Ravi Saligram, Newell Brands President and CEO. “I am proud of the way our team has navigated through a difficult operating and inflationary backdrop, delivering more than 12 percent growth in both core sales and normalized operating income, with further improvement on complexity reduction, productivity, cash conversion cycle and a robust innovation pipeline. As we look to 2022, we will continue to act with speed and agility to address external headwinds, with a laser focus on gross margins, and execute on our strategic objective to drive sustainable and profitable growth, while building competitive advantage and serving as a force for good. I continue to believe that Newell's best days are ahead of us and that our focused and deliberate actions will drive strong shareholder returns.” 

Chris Peterson, Chief Financial Officer and President, Business Operations, said, “In the fourth quarter, we delivered core sales growth of 5.8 percent, building on the strong momentum of the prior five quarters. Effective cost management, decisive actions to mitigate the impact of inflation, and stronger top line drove upside to our expectations on operating profit. We strengthened the balance sheet, exiting 2021 with a 3.0x leverage ratio, and reduced the cash conversion cycle, even as we decided to strategically build inventories. We expect 2022 to mark another year of progress, despite a challenging operating environment. For 2022, we forecast core sales growth of flat to 2 percent, normalized operating margin expansion of 50 to 80 basis points, and normalized diluted EPS of $1.85 to $1.93.” 

Fourth Quarter 2021 Executive Summary

–Net sales were $2.8 billion, an increase of 4.3 percent compared with the prior year period, during which the company experienced elevated demand across many of its categories. 

–Core sales grew 5.8 percent compared with the prior year period. Six of eight business units and every major region increased core sales compared with the prior year period. 

–Reported operating margin was 6.0 percent compared with 9.2 percent in the prior year period, largely reflecting the headwinds from significant inflation, as well as non-cash impairment charges, which more than offset benefits from lower overhead costs, FUEL productivity savings, and pricing. Normalized operating margin was 9.9 percent compared with 11.4 percent in the prior year period.

–Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.22 compared with $0.30 per share in the prior year period, with the year over year change largely reflecting the decline in reported operating profit and a change in the tax provision due to a reduction in discrete tax benefits. 

–Normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.42 compared with $0.56 per share in the prior year period.

News Release

Fourth Quarter 2021 Operating Results

Net sales were $2.8 billion, a 4.3 percent increase compared to the prior year period, as core sales growth of 5.8 percent was partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, as well as business and retail store exits. Net sales were 6.9 percent above the fourth quarter 2019 level. 

Reported gross margin was 29.8 percent compared with 32.9 percent in the prior year period, as the significant headwind from inflation, particularly related to resin, sourced finished goods, transportation and labor, more than offset the benefits from FUEL productivity savings and pricing. Normalized gross margin was 30.1 percent compared with 32.9 percent in the prior year period.

Reported operating income was $168 million compared with $248 million in the prior year period. Reported operating margin was 6.0 percent compared to 9.2 percent in the prior year period, largely reflecting the headwinds from significant inflation, as well as non-cash impairment charges, which more than offset benefits from lower overhead costs, FUEL productivity savings, and pricing. Normalized operating income was $279 million, or 9.9 percent of sales, compared with $307 million or 11.4 percent of sales, in the prior year period. 

Interest expense was $59 million compared with $69 million in the prior year period, reflecting a reduction in the company's debt balance. 

The company reported a tax provision of $13 million compared with a tax benefit of $26 million in the prior year period, reflecting a reduction in discrete tax benefits. Normalized tax expense was $38 million compared with a tax benefit of $6 million in the prior year period.

The company reported net income of $96 million, or $0.22 diluted earnings per share, compared with net income of $127 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, in the prior year period. The year over year change largely reflects the decline in reported operating profit and a change in the tax provision due to a reduction in discrete tax benefits. 

Normalized net income was $180 million, or $0.42 normalized diluted earnings per share, compared with $238 million, or $0.56 normalized diluted earnings per share, in the prior year period. 

An explanation of non-GAAP measures disclosed in this release and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP results to comparable GAAP measures are included in the tables attached to this release. 

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

During full year 2021, the company generated operating cash flow of $884 million compared with $1.4 billion in the prior year, reflecting a working capital increase to support strong net sales growth, which more than offset the year over year improvement in operating income and cash conversion cycle.

Outlook for Full Year and First Quarter 2022 

The company initiated its full year and first quarter outlook for 2022 as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On February 7, the company announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell the Connected Home & Security (CH&S) business to Resideo Technologies, Inc., for gross proceeds of $593 million, subject to customary working capital and transaction adjustments. The company anticipates using the after-tax proceeds toward both debt paydown and share repurchase, with the goal of maintaining the company's current leverage ratio. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.

News Release

The outlook for Q1 2022 includes the results of the CH&S business. The full year 2022 outlook assumes that the divestiture of CH&S will be completed at the very end of the first quarter. Net sales outlooks for both Q1 2022, as well as for the full year 2022, also account for the expected unfavorable foreign exchange movements, using current rates, as well as additional closures of Yankee Candle retail locations, and exits from low margin categories, primarily in the Outdoor & Recreation and Home Appliances segments. Core sales growth outlooks for both Q1 2022 and full year 2022 exclude the contribution from CH&S. 

For full year 2022, the company expects to deliver operating cash flow in the range of $800 million to $850 million, including the impact of the loss of profits from the sale of the CH&S business, as well as one time cash taxes payable on this transaction. 

The company has presented forward-looking statements regarding normalized operating margin and normalized earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgement and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking normalized operating margin or normalized earnings per share to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, we believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company's future financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures are preliminary estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end and year-end adjustments. Any variation between the company's actual results and preliminary financial data set forth above may be material.

Conference Call

Newell Brands’ fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call will be held today, February 11, at 8:30 a.m. ET. A link to the webcast is provided under Events & Presentations in the Investors section of the company’s website at www.newellbrands.com. A webcast replay will be made available in the Quarterly Earnings section of the company’s website.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This release contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that are included in this press release and the additional financial information both to explain its results to stockholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures (a) permit investors to view the company’s performance and liquidity using the same tools that management uses to evaluate the company’s past performance, reportable segments, prospects for future performance and liquidity, and (b) determine certain elements of management incentive compensation.

The company’s management believes that core sales provides a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales on a consistent basis as it excludes the impacts of acquisitions, planned and completed divestitures, retail store openings and closings, certain market and

News Release

category exits, and changes in foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. The effect of changes in foreign exchange on reported sales is calculated by applying the prior year average monthly exchange rates to the current year local currency sales amounts (excluding acquisitions and divestitures), with the difference between the 2021 reported sales and constant currency sales presented as the foreign exchange impact increase or decrease in core sales. The company’s management believes that “normalized” gross margin, “normalized” operating income, “normalized” operating margin, "normalized EBITDA," “normalized” net income, “normalized” diluted earnings per share, “normalized” interest and “normalized” tax benefits, which exclude restructuring and restructuring-related expenses and one-time and other events such as costs related to the extinguishment of debt, certain tax benefits and charges, impairment charges, pension settlement charges, divestiture costs, costs related to the acquisition, integration and financing of acquired businesses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inflationary adjustments, expenses related to certain product recalls and certain other items, are useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the company’s core ongoing operations and liquidity. “Normalized EBITDA” is an ongoing liquidity measure (that excludes non-cash items) and is calculated as pro forma normalized earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense. "Leverage ratio" is a liquidity measure calculated as the ratio of net debt (defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to normalized EBITDA. 

The company determines the tax effect of the items excluded from normalized diluted earnings per share by applying the estimated effective rate for the applicable jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain situations in which an item excluded from normalized results impacts income tax expense, the company utilizes a “with” and “without” approach to determine normalized income tax benefit or expense. The company will also exclude one-time tax expenses related to a change in tax status of certain entities and the loss of GILTI tax credits as a result of utilizing the 50% IRC Section 163(j) limit resulting from the CARES Act to determine normalized income tax benefit.

While the company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the company’s performance and liquidity, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
