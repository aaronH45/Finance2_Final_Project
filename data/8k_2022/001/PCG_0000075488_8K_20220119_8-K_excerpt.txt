On January 19, 2022, the People and Compensation Committee of the PG&E Corporation Board of Directors (the “Committee”) adopted the PG&E Corporation Short-Term Incentive Plan (the “STIP”), under which officers and employees of PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the “Utility”) (together, the “Companies”) and their subsidiaries are eligible to receive incentive-based cash compensation based on selected metrics that are designed to align their interests with those of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Pursuant to the STIP, the Committee or its delegate will have the discretionary authority to administer the STIP, including granting awards consistent with the terms of the STIP to the Companies’ executive officers. The STIP sets parameters for the Committee (or its delegates) to determine, among other things, eligibility to participate in the STIP, the payout value of STIP awards, and the treatment of STIP awards upon various termination events.
