Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.

On February 13, 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation (the “Company”) sent a notice to Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (“Aerojet Rocketdyne”) terminating its previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 20, 2020, by and among the Company, Mizar Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Aerojet Rocketdyne, which provided for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Aerojet Rocketdyne, with Aerojet Rocketdyne surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger” and such agreement, the “Merger Agreement”). A description of the Merger Agreement was included in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Lockheed Martin on December 21, 2020, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Lockheed Martin’s termination of the Merger Agreement followed the filing by the Federal Trade Commission on January 25, 2022, of complaints to block the closing of the Merger in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and before the Federal Trade Commission. No termination penalties were incurred by either party in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement.

Aerojet Rocketdyne is primarily a technology-based engineering and manufacturing company that develops and produces specialized power and propulsion systems, as well as armament systems. It develops and manufactures liquid and solid rocket propulsion, air-breathing hypersonic engines, and electric power and propulsion for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Aerojet Rocketdyne is a supplier of propulsion systems on multiple of the Company’s missile defense, strategic deterrence, strike, hypersonics and orbital access programs including significantly, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and Orion and is providing propulsion for the Company's Next Generation Interceptor offering. According to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, sales to the Company made up approximately 34% of its net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 31% of its net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

On February 13, 2022, the Company issued a news release announcing the termination of the Merger Agreement. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

The information contained in this Item 7.01 and in Exhibit 99.1 is furnished and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of the Company’s filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
