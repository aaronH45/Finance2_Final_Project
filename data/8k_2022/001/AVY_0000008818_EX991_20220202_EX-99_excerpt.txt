GLENDALE, Calif., February 2, 2022 – Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) today announced preliminary, unaudited results for its fourth quarter and full year ended January 1, 2022. Non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this document are reconciled to GAAP in the attached financial schedules. Unless otherwise indicated, comparisons are to the same period in the prior year.  

“2021 marked the company’s tenth consecutive year of strong top- and bottom-line growth,” said Mitch Butier, chairman, president and CEO. “We delivered 19 percent revenue growth on a constant currency basis and 25 percent adjusted earnings per share growth, while generating record free cash flow.  

“Our strong performance comes at a challenging time as the global health crisis continues, supply chains are tight and significant inflationary pressures persist.   

“2021 marked an important milestone for the company, as the final year of measurement for the five-year financial targets we communicated in early 2017,” added Butier. “I’m pleased to report that we achieved our long-term goals for this period.”  

“For 2022, we expect to again deliver strong top- and bottom-line growth and are targeting continued progress toward our 2025 goals,” said Butier.  

“Once again, I want to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts to keep one another safe while delivering for all our stakeholders.”  

Operational/Market Update  

In the fourth quarter, uncertainty surrounding the global health crisis remained elevated as many parts of the world experienced an increase in COVID-19 cases. The safety and well-being of employees remains the company’s top priority. The company has continued to adapt its world-class safety protocols as the pandemic evolves. All manufacturing locations are currently operational.  

The company continues to actively manage through a dynamic supply and demand environment. Demand across the majority of its businesses and regions remains strong, while raw materials, freight and labor availability continue to be constrained. The company continues to leverage its global scale and work closely with customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions. Inflation remains persistent and additional pricing and material re-engineering actions are being implemented to offset higher costs.  

Fourth Quarter 2021 Results by Segment  

Label and Graphic Materials  

   ●    

Reported sales increased 3% to $1.3 billion. Compared to prior year, sales were up 12% ex. currency and 11% on an organic basis.

Sales increased by low-double digits organically in the combined Graphics and Reflective Solutions businesses.   

   ¡    

On an organic basis, sales were up mid-teens in North America and high-single digits in Western Europe and emerging markets.  

   ●    

Reported operating margin decreased 370 basis points to 12.2%. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 310 basis points to 14.5%, as the benefit from higher organic volume/mix was more than offset by the net impact of pricing, freight and raw material costs and the impact of the extra week in 2020.  

   ¡    

The higher revenue base from price increases alone, with no corresponding incremental EBITDA as they are offsetting inflation, reduced margin by ~140 basis points.  

Retail Branding and Information Solutions  

   ●    

Reported sales increased 30% to $659 million. Sales were up 39% ex. currency and 20% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth in both the high value product categories and the base business.  

   ¡    

Intelligent Labels was up more than 20% organically.  

   ●    

Reported operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 14.7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 30 basis points to 19.3%, as the benefits from acquisitions and higher volume were more than offset by growth investments, higher employee-related costs and the headwind from prior-year temporary cost reduction actions.  

   ●    

The Vestcom business is achieving our acquisition objectives.  

Industrial and Healthcare Materials  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ●    

Reported operating margin decreased 360 basis points to 8.8%. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 300 basis points to 12.9% as the benefit from productivity was more than offset by the net impact of pricing, freight and raw material costs, the impact of the extra week in 2020, higher employee-related costs and growth investments.  

   ¡    

The higher revenue base from price increases alone, with no corresponding incremental EBITDA as they are offsetting inflation, reduced margin by ~90 basis points.   

Other  

Balance Sheet and Capital Deployment  

During 2021, the company deployed $1.48 billion for acquisitions and returned $402 million in cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, up from $301 million compared to last year. The company repurchased 0.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $181 million. Net of dilution from long-term incentive awards, the company’s year-end share count was down by 0.3 million compared to the same time last year.  

The company’s balance sheet remains strong, with ample capacity to continue executing our long term capital allocation strategy. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was 2.2 at the end of the fourth quarter, below the lower end of the company’s long-term target range.  

Income Taxes  

The company’s reported effective tax rate was 25% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. The company’s adjusted (non-GAAP) tax rate was 23.9% for the fourth quarter and 25% for the full year.  

The company’s 2022 adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the mid-twenty percent range based on current tax regulations.  

Cost Reduction Actions  

In the fourth quarter and full year 2021, the company realized $16 million and $63 million, respectively, in pre-tax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, and incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $7 million and $14 million, respectively, the vast majority of which represents cash charges.  

Guidance  

In its supplemental presentation materials, “Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Financial Review and Analysis,” the company provides a list of factors that it believes will contribute to its 2022 financial results. Based on the factors listed and other assumptions, the company expects 2022 reported earnings per share of $9.25 to $9.65.  

Excluding an estimated $0.10 per share impact of restructuring charges and other items, the company expects 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $9.35 to $9.75.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP  

We report our financial results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and also communicate with investors using certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for or superior to, the comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the presentation of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Based on feedback from investors and financial analysts, we believe that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures we provide are useful to their assessments of our performance and operating trends, as well as liquidity.  

Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it difficult to assess our underlying performance in a single period. By excluding the accounting effects, positive or negative, of certain items (e.g., restructuring charges, outcomes of certain legal proceedings, certain effects of strategic transactions and related costs, losses from debt extinguishments, gains or losses from curtailment or settlement of pension obligations, gains or losses on sales of certain assets, gains or losses on venture investments, and other items), we believe that we are providing meaningful supplemental information that facilitates an understanding of our core operating results and liquidity measures. While some of the items we exclude from GAAP financial measures recur, they tend to be disparate in amount, frequency, or timing.  

We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate trends in our underlying performance, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for quarters and year-to-date periods, as applicable.  

We use the non-GAAP financial measures described below in the accompanying news release and presentation.  

Sales change ex. currency refers to the increase or decrease in net sales, excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, and, where applicable, an extra week in our fiscal year and the calendar shift resulting from the extra week in the prior fiscal year and currency adjustment for transitional reporting of highly inflationary economies. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation is calculated on a constant currency basis, with prior period results translated at current period average exchange rates to exclude the effect of currency fluctuations.  

Organic sales change refers to sales change ex. currency, excluding the estimated impact of acquisitions and product line divestitures.  

We believe that sales change ex. currency and organic sales change assist investors in evaluating the sales change from the ongoing activities of our businesses and enhance their ability to evaluate our results from period to period.  

Adjusted operating income refers to income before taxes; interest expense; other non-operating expense (income), net; and other expense (income), net.  

Adjusted EBITDA refers to adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization.  

Adjusted operating margin refers to adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales.  

Adjusted EBITDA margin refers to adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.  

Adjusted tax rate refers to the full-year GAAP tax rate, adjusted to exclude certain unusual or infrequent events that are expected to significantly impact that rate, such as effects of certain discrete tax planning actions, impacts related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), where applicable, and other items.  

Adjusted net income refers to income before taxes, tax-effected at the adjusted tax rate, and adjusted for tax-effected restructuring charges and other items.  

Adjusted net income per common share, assuming dilution (adjusted EPS) refers to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, assuming dilution.  

We believe that adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS assist investors in understanding our core operating trends and comparing our results with those of our competitors.  

Net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio refers to total debt (including finance leases) less cash and cash equivalents, divided by adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months. We believe that the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio assists investors in assessing our leverage position.  

Free cash flow refers to cash flow provided by operating activities, less payments for property, plant and equipment, software and other deferred charges, plus proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, plus (minus) net proceeds from insurance and sales (purchases) of investments. Free cash flow is also adjusted for, where applicable, certain acquisition-related transaction costs. We believe that free cash flow assists investors by showing the amount of cash we have available for debt reductions, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions.  

Reconciliations are provided in accordance with Regulations G and S-K and reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
