“We continue to make good progress on the two remaining regulatory approvals which are conditions to close our transaction.

There are many factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the Merger will not be completed on a timely basis (including the timelines set forth in this press release) or at all, whether due to the failure to satisfy the conditions of the Merger (including approvals or clearances from regulatory and other agencies and bodies) or otherwise, general business and economic conditions globally, industry trends, competition, changes in government and other regulation, changes in political and economic stability, disruptions in business operations due to reorganization activities, interest rate and currency fluctuations, the inability of the Combined Company to realize successfully any anticipated synergy benefits when (and if) the Merger is implemented, the inability of the Combined Company to integrate successfully NortonLifeLock’s and Avast’s operations when (and if) the Merger is implemented, fluctuations and volatility in NortonLifeLock’s stock price, the ability of NortonLifeLock to successfully execute strategic plans, the ability of NortonLifeLock to maintain customer and partner relationships, the timing and market acceptance of new product releases and upgrades, matters arising out of the ongoing SEC investigation and the Combined Company incurring and/or experiencing unanticipated costs and/or delays or difficulties relating to the Merger when (and if) it is implemented.
