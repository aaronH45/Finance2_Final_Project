Clorox Reports Q2 Fiscal Year 2022 Results, Updates Outlook 

OAKLAND, California, Feb. 3, 2022 — The Clorox Company (NYSE: CLX) today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, which ended on Dec. 31, 2021. 

Second-Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Summary

Following is a summary of key second-quarter results. All comparisons are with the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 unless otherwise stated.

•Net sales declined 8% to $1.7 billion in comparison to a 27% increase in the year-ago quarter, or an increase of 19% on a two-year stack basis. The decline in net sales reflects a 10-point decline in volume and 2 points of favorable price mix. Foreign exchange was flat, and organic sales1 for the quarter declined 8%.

•Gross margin decreased 1240 basis points to 33% from 45% in the year-ago quarter driven primarily by higher manufacturing & logistics and commodity costs.

•Diluted net earnings per share (diluted EPS) declined 72% to $0.56 from $2.03 in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by lower gross margin and lower net sales.

•Adjusted EPS1 declined 67% to $0.66 and excludes 10 cents related to investments in the company’s long-term strategic digital capabilities and productivity enhancements.

•Year-to-date net cash provided by operations declined 65% to $222 million, compared to $629 million in the year-ago period. 

“In the face of a challenging cost environment, we’re executing well on the factors we control. We’re driving cost savings and pricing to mitigate inflationary headwinds, while also continuing to meet strong demand across our portfolio. And we’re keeping an eye on the long-term by investing in innovation, our brands and strategic digital capabilities,” said CEO Linda Rendle.

“Although we expect cost pressures will continue through fiscal year 2022, we’re confident we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to strengthen our competitive position, build a stronger, more resilient company, and create long-term shareholder value.”

Strategic & Operational Highlights 

In the second quarter, the company:

•Grew market share in the majority of its businesses, including a second straight quarter of double-digit share increase for disinfecting wipes, driven by strong demand-building plans and continued progress in restoring supply across its portfolio. 

•Achieved record consumer value superiority across its portfolio (75%).

•Accelerated pricing actions on the vast majority of its portfolio, including multiple rounds on select brands, to mitigate rising costs.

•Launched new innovations that support consumer well-being and the company’s ESG commitments. New Clorox® Disinfecting Mists make it easier to disinfect hard and soft surfaces while also providing reusable sprayers and refills that help send less waste to landfill. Additionally, the new Clorox® Multi-Purpose Cleaner concentrate packaging uses 80% less plastic than a typical 16-ounce bottle. And, tapping into scent trends, the company introduced Glad® ForceFlexPlus Cherry Blossom.

•Added Alaska Airlines to its out-of-home, multi-year partnerships. Clorox will supply hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes for most of the airports where the airline operates and all of its lounges.

Key Segment Results

The following is a summary of key second-quarter results by reportable segment. All comparisons are with the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, unless otherwise stated. 

Health and Wellness (Cleaning; Professional Products; Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements) 

•Net sales declined 21%, reflecting decreases in all three businesses. The decline was primarily driven by an 18 point-decline in volume from lower shipments in Cleaning and Professional Products and 3 points of unfavorable price mix. On a two-year stack basis, net sales grew 21%.

◦Cleaning sales decreased double digits primarily due to lapping significant demand in the year-ago period related to COVID-19 impacts. Sales were also impacted by unfavorable price mix as assortment and the promotional environment continued to normalize. 

◦Professional Products sales decreased double digits primarily due to lower shipments of Clorox® Total 360® as the business lapped peak COVID-driven demand. 

◦Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements sales decreased primarily due to lower shipments of noncore brands.

•Segment pretax earnings declined 77% primarily due to lower net sales, higher manufacturing & logistics and commodity costs, partially offset by lower advertising costs.

Household (Bags and Wraps, Grilling, Cat Litter)

◦Bags and Wraps sales increased primarily due to strong consumption supported by innovation and the benefits of pricing. 

◦Grilling sales decreased primarily due to lapping significant demand in the year-ago period related to COVID-19 impacts. 

◦Cat Litter sales increased primarily due to the benefits of pricing and innovation. 

•Segment pretax earnings decreased 83%, primarily due to higher commodity and manufacturing & logistics costs, and partially offset by higher net sales.

Lifestyle (Food, Natural Personal Care, Water Filtration)

•Net sales increased 2%, reflecting increases in two of three businesses, primarily driven by a 1-point increase in volume and 1 point of favorable price mix. On a two-year stack basis, net sales grew 11%.

◦Food sales increased driven primarily by improved supply, strong merchandising and the benefits of pricing. 

◦Natural Personal Care sales decreased primarily due to earlier timing of holiday shipments in the first quarter. 

◦Water Filtration sales increased primarily driven by expanded distribution and strong merchandising.

•Segment pretax earnings decreased 10%, primarily due to higher commodity and manufacturing & logistics costs, and partially offset by higher net sales. 

International (Sales Outside the U.S.)

•Net sales were flat, driven primarily by 8 points of favorable price mix, a 5-point decline in volume and 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 3%. On a two-year stack basis, net sales grew 23%.

◦Reflects a sales decline of 7% in the first half of fiscal year 2022, or an increase of 19% on a two-year stack basis, compared to 27% sales growth in the first half of fiscal year 2021.

◦By the fourth quarter, the company expects sales to return to its long-term sales growth target of 3% to 5%. 

•Gross margin decline of about 750 basis points, primarily due to higher than previously anticipated commodity and manufacturing & logistics costs, with the assumption of a return to gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter.

•Advertising and sales promotion spending at about 10% of net sales, reflecting the company’s ongoing commitment to invest behind its brands. 

•Selling & administrative expenses at about 15% of net sales, reflecting about 1 point of impact from the company’s strategic investments in digital capabilities and productivity enhancements.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

•This press release contains non-GAAP financial information related to organic sales growth/(decrease) and adjusted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, and organic sales growth/(decrease) and adjusted EPS outlook for fiscal year 2022.

•Clorox defines organic sales growth/(decrease) as GAAP net sales growth/(decrease) excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate changes and any acquisitions or divestitures.

•Organic sales growth/(decrease) outlook for fiscal year 2022 excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, which the company currently expects to have only a limited impact on GAAP net sales growth/(decrease).

•Management believes that the presentation of organic sales growth/(decrease) is useful to investors because it excludes sales from any acquisitions and divestitures, which results in a comparison of sales only from the businesses that the company was operating and expects to continue to operate throughout the relevant periods, and the company's estimate of the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, which are difficult to predict and out of the control of the company and management. However, organic sales growth/(decrease) may not be the same as similar measures provided by other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation or differences in which items are incorporated into these adjustments.

•Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for significant items that are nonrecurring or unusual.

•Adjusted EPS is supplemental information that management uses to help evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance. Management believes that by adjusting for certain nonrecurring or unusual items, such as significant losses/(gains) related to acquisitions, impairment charges and other nonrecurring or unusual items, investors and management are able to gain additional insight into the company's underlying operating performance on a consistent basis over time. However, adjusted EPS may not be the same as similar measures provided by other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation or differences in which items are incorporated into these adjustments.
