These forward - looking st atements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward - looking statements often use words such as “anticipate”, “target ”, “expect”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “goal”, “believe”, “aim”, “will”, “may”, “would”, “could” or “should” or other words of similar meaning or the negative there of, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward - looking. Forward - looking statements include statements relating to the following: (i) futur e capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, economic performance, financial conditions, dividend policy, losses and future prospects, (ii) business and management strate gie s and the expansion and growth of the operations of NortonLifeLock or Avast, (iii) the effects of government regulation on the business of NortonLifeLock or Avast, an d (iv) the time frame and the expected benefits of the proposed combination to NortonLifeLock, Avast, and their respective customers, stockholders and investors, in clu ding expected growth, earnings accretion and cost savings. There are many factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implie d i n forward - looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the proposed combination will not be completed on a timely basis or at all , whether due to the failure to satisfy the conditions of the proposed combination (including approvals or clearances from regulatory and other agencies and bodies) or o the rwise, general business and economic conditions globally, industry trends, competition, changes in government and other regulation, changes in political and econo mic stability, disruptions in business operations due to reorganization activities, interest rate and currency fluctuations, the inability of the combined entity to realize su cce ssfully any anticipated synergy benefits when (and if) the proposed combination is implemented, the inability of the combined entity to integrate successfully NortonLifeLo ck’ s and Avast’s operations when (and if) the proposed combination is implemented, fluctuations and volatility in NortonLifeLock’s stock price, the ability of NortonLifeLo ck to successfully execute strategic plans, the ability of NortonLifeLock to maintain customer and partner relationships, the timing and market acceptance of new product rel eas es and upgrades, matters arising out of the ongoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) investigation and the combined entity incurring and/or experienci ng unanticipated costs and/or delays or difficulties relating to the proposed combination when (and if) it is implemented. Additional information concerning these an d o ther risk factors is contained in the Risk Factors sections of NortonLifeLock’s most recent reports on Form 10 - K and Form 10 - Q, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, nor do they form part of, this presentation. These forward - looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the present and future business strategies of such persons and the environment in which each will operate in the future. By their nature, these forward - looking statements involve known and unknown risks, as well as u ncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors described in the context of such forward - looking statemen ts in this presentation may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of any such person, or industry results and developments, to be materially different fro m a ny results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward - looking statements. No assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have bee n correct and persons reading this presentation are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward - looking statements, which speak only as at the date of this presentation. All subsequent oral or written forward - looking statements attributable to NortonLifeLock or Avast or any persons acting on their behalf are exp ressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. Neither of NortonLifeLock or Avast undertakes any obligation to update publicly or revise forward - lo oking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange ru les . 1 Legal Disclaimers

Notice to U.S. Investors in Avast The transaction relates to the acquisition of the securities of an English company, and is expected to be implemented pursuan t t o a scheme of arrangement under English law. A transaction implemented by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Excha nge Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, the transaction is subject to disclosure requirements and practices applicable in the UK to schemes of arrangement which diff er from the disclosure and procedural requirements of US tender offer rules. Any financial information included in this presentation may have been prepared in acco rda nce with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom and thus may not be comparable to financial information of US companies or companies whose financial state men ts are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. If NortonLifeLock exercises its right in the future to impleme nt the transaction by way of a takeover offer, that offer will be made in compliance with applicable US laws and regulations. It may be difficult for US holders of the Avast shares to enforce their rights and claims arising out of the US federal secur iti es laws, since Avast is located in a country other than the United States, and some or all of its officers and directors are residents of a country other than the United States . U S holders of Avast's shares may not be able to sue a non - US company or its officers or directors in a non - US court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non - US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's judgement. Use of Non - GAAP Financial Information We use the non - GAAP measures of operating margin, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on U. S. GAAP and exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. We also provide the non - GAAP metrics of revenues, constant currency revenue, EBITDA, reported EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA margin and free cash flow, which is defined as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. These non - GAAP financia l measures are provided to enhance the user's understanding of our past financial performance and our prospects for the future. Our management team uses these non - GAAP financial measures in assessing NortonLifeLock's performance, as well as in planning and forecasting future periods. These non - GAAP financial measures are not c omputed according to U.S. GAAP and the methods we use to compute them may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non - GAAP financial measures are supplemental , should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our c ons olidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See appendix for reconciliation of certain financial measures included herein from GAAP to non - GAAP. Readers are encouraged to r eview the additional reconciliations of our non - GAAP financial measures to the comparable U.S. GAAP results, which is attached to our quarterly earnings release and whi ch can be found, along with other financial information, on the investor relations page of our website at Investor.NortonLifeLock.com. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward - looking non - GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures because certain information is dependent on future eve nts , some of which are outside the control of NortonLifeLock. Moreover, estimating such U.S. GAAP financial measures with the required precision necessary to provide a mea ningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort.

No Profit Forecasts or Estimates The NortonLifeLock Profit Forecast (see below) is a profit forecast for the purposes of Rule 28 of the UK’s City Code on Take ove rs and Mergers (the “Code”). Other than the NortonLifeLock Profit Forecast, no statement in this presentation is intended as, or is to be construed as, a profit forecast or estimate for any period and no statement in this presentation should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per ordinary share, for NortonLifeLock or Avast, respect ive ly for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per ordinary share for NortonLifeLock or Avas t, respectively. Statements of estimated cost savings and synergies relate to future actions and circumstances which, by their nature, involve ri sks, uncertainties and contingencies. As a result, the cost savings and synergies referred to in this presentation (defined below as the Quantified Financial Benefits S tat ement) may not be achieved, may be achieved later or sooner than estimated, or those achieved could be materially different from those estimated. No statement in the Qua nti fied Financial Benefits Statement, or this presentation generally (other than the NortonLifeLock Profit Forecast (see below)), should be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that the Combined Company’s earnings in the first full year following the combination, or in any subsequent period, would necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of Avast and/or NortonLifeLock for the relevant preceding financial period or any other period. For the purposes of Rule 28 of the Cod e, the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement contained in this presentation is the responsibility of NortonLifeLock and the NortonLifeLock Directors . 4 Legal Disclaimers (cont’d)  

 Copyright © 202 2 NortonLifeLock + Avast . All rights reserved. Quantified Financial Benefits Statement This presentation contains statements of estimated cost savings and synergies arising from the Merger (together, the “Quantif ied Financial Benefits Statement”). A copy of the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement is set out below: “Given the complementary nature of both NortonLifeLock and Avast, the NortonLifeLock Directors believe that the Merger will g ene rate synergies that could not be achieved independently of the Merger and will lead to significant long - term value creation for all shareholders. Significant recurring cost synergies opportunity NortonLifeLock anticipates that the Merger will result in recurring annual pre - tax gross cost synergies for the Combined Company to reach a run - rate of approximately USD 280 million, representing between approximately 15% and 20% of combined adjusted cost of sales and operating spend, based on the latest full year reported results for each of NortonLifeLock and Avast. The synergies are expected to be fully realised by the end of the second year following com ple tion of the Merger. NortonLifeLock intends to approach integration with the aim of retaining and motivating the best talent and structure across the Combined Company to create a best - in - class organisation. The expected sources of the identified cost synergies are as follows: • Organisation: approximately 50% of the total annual run - rate pre - tax gross cost synergies are expected to be generated through t he adoption of shared best practice across existing functions and the reduction of duplicate roles across all geographies, and from a broad range of job categori es, including management, shared services, product and commercial functions; • Systems & Infrastructure operating costs: approximately 25% of the total annual run - rate pre - tax gross cost synergies are expect ed to be realised through migration onto a common data and security platform, integration of systems, and shared technology and analytics infrastructure; and • Contracts & Shared Services: approximately 25% of the total annual run - rate pre - tax gross cost synergies are expected to be gene rated primarily from site rationalisation, procurement and vendor consolidation, and spend de - duplication. NortonLifeLock expects to realise approximately 60% of the run - rate cost savings by the end of the first full year following com pletion of the Merger and 100% by the end of the second full year following completion of the Merger, excluding any potential synergy reinvestment and associated benefits . O n a reported basis, the synergies assume the Combined Company expects to benefit from approximately USD 75 million of cost savings in the first full year following co mpl etion of the Merger, approximately USD 245 million of cost savings in the second full year following completion of the Merger, and the full USD 280 million of the c ost savings in the third full year following completion of the Merger, excluding any potential synergy reinvestment and associated benefits. One - off costs In order to realise these synergies, NortonLifeLock is expected to incur one - off restructuring and integration costs of approxim ately one year’s run - rate pre - tax cost savings, or USD 280 million, with approximately USD 180 million estimated to be incurred in the first full year following completion o f t he Merger and approximately USD 100 million estimated to be incurred in the second full year following completion of the Merger. Aside from integration costs, no materia l d is - benefits are expected to arise in connection with the Merger. The expected synergies will accrue as a direct result of the Merger and would not be achieved on a s tandalone basis. The paragraphs above relating to expected cost synergies constitute a “Quantified Financial Benefits Statement” for the purpo ses of Rule 28 of the Code. Given the strong strategic, cultural and operational fit of the two companies, NortonLifeLock believes that the quantified co st synergies are readily achievable. NortonLifeLock expects to achieve the quantified cost synergies while maintaining appropriate investment levels in sales and tec hnology to meet the Combined Company’s growth targets and other objectives. The estimated cost synergies referred to above reflect both the beneficial elements and the relevant costs.” Further information on the bases of belief supporting the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, including the principal as sum ptions and sources of information, is set out below. 5 Legal Disclaimers (cont’d)  

 Copyright © 202 2 NortonLifeLock + Avast . All rights reserved. Bases of belief and principal assumptions In preparing the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, a synergy working group comprising senior strategy, operations, tec hni cal, sales and financial personnel from NortonLifeLock (the “Working Group”) was established to identify, challenge and quantify the potential synergies available fr om the integration of the NortonLifeLock and Avast businesses, and to undertake an initial planning exercise. In preparing the detailed synergy plan, both NortonLifeLock and Avast have shared certain operating and financial information to support the evaluation of the potential synergies available from the Merger and have conducted a series of virtual meetings with the key management personnel of both No rtonLifeLock and Avast. This has included input from both the NortonLifeLock and Avast executive leadership teams. Based on the information shared and interactions with Avast, the Working Group has performed a bottom - up analysis of costs inclu ded in the NortonLifeLock and Avast financial information and has sought to include in the synergy analysis those costs which the Working Group believe will be e ith er optimised or reduced as a result of the Merger. In circumstances where the information provided by Avast has been limited for commercial or other reasons, the Workin g G roup has made estimates and assumptions to aid its development of individual synergy initiatives. The assessment and quantification of the potential syne rgi es have in turn been informed by NortonLifeLock management’s industry experience as well as their experience of executing and integrating acquisitions in the pas t. The baseline used as the basis for the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement is NortonLifeLock’s adjusted cost base for the fi nancial year ended 2 April 2021, supported where relevant by certain information from NortonLifeLock’s budgeted cost base for the financial year ending 1 April 2022, and Avast’s adjusted cost base for the financial year ended 31 December 2020, supported where relevant by certain information from Avast’s budgeted cost base for the financia l y ear ending 31 December 2021. The quantified synergies are incremental to NortonLifeLock’s and, to the best of NortonLifeLock’s knowledge, Avast’s existing pl ans. In general, the synergy assumptions have in turn been risk adjusted, exercising a degree of prudence in the calculation of th e e stimated synergy benefit set out above. In arriving at the estimate of synergies set out in the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, the NortonLifeLock managemen t h as made the following assumptions: • regarding organisational savings: • savings will be possible by removing duplicate resource through the roll - out of the revised operating model; • the Combined Company will be able to standardise and roll - out best practice systems and procedures, to generate efficiency and e nable headcount reductions; and • no restrictions or delays will arise as a result of industrial relations or employment agreements that significantly affect t he realisation of savings by removing duplicate resource; • there will be no material impact on the underlying operations of either company or their ability to continue to conduct their bu sinesses, including as a result of, or in connection with, the integration of the Avast Group and the NortonLifeLock Group; • the Combined Company’s product offering generates at least the same level of total revenues as the Avast’s and NortonLifeLock ’s offerings currently generate; • procurement savings can be realised through rationalising suppliers and renegotiating supplier terms; • there will be no material change to macroeconomic, political, regulatory, legal or tax conditions in the markets or regions i n w hich NortonLifeLock and Avast operate that will materially impact the implementation of, or costs to achieve, the expected cost savings; • there will be no material divestments from the existing businesses of either NortonLifeLock or Avast; • there will be no material change in current foreign exchange rates; and • there will be no business disruptions that materially affect either company, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, cyb er - attacks and/or technological issues or supply chain disruptions. 6 Legal Disclaimers (cont’d)
