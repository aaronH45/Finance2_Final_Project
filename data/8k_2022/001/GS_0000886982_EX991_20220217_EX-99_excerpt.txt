End Notes These notes refer to the financial metrics and/or defined term presented on: Slide 2: 1. Per company filings. Peer set includes MS, JPM, BAC, C 2 Return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly common shareholders’ equity. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity (ROTE) is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders’ equity. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is calculated as total shareholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Management believes that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally and that tangible common shareholders’ equity is meaningful because it is a measure that the firm and investors use to assess capital adequacy. ROTE and tangible common shareholders’ equity are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The table below presents a reconciliation of average common shareholders’ equity to average tangible common shareholders’ equity: Slide 3: 1. ROTE is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements 

Statements about the firm’s target metrics, including its target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, and statements about future operating expense (including future litigation expense), efficiency ratio targets and expense savings initiatives, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, results, financial position and liquidity, fundraising initiatives and amount and composition of future Assets under Supervision and related revenues, anticipated asset sales, increases in wallet share, planned debt issuances, growth of deposits and other funding, asset liability management and funding strategies and associated interest expense savings, future geographic location of its employees, and the timing and profitability of its business initiatives, including the prospects of new businesses (including Transaction Banking and credit card partnerships) or new activities, its ability to increase its market share in incumbent businesses and its ability to achieve more durable revenues and higher returns from these initiatives, are forward- looking statements, and it is possible that the firm’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the targeted results indicated in these statements. 

Forward looking statements, including those about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its business prospects and are subject to the risk that the firm may be unable to achieve its targets due to, among other things, changes in the firm’s business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. Statements about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to the firm and are subject to the risk that the firm’s actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the firm resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of the firm’s activities or its expectations around the sale of assets. Statements about our AUS inflows targets and related revenues and capital reductions are based on our current expectations regarding our fundraising prospects and ability to sell assets and are subject to the risk that actual inflows and revenues and asset sales may be lower than expected due to, among other factors, competition from other asset managers, changes in investment preferences and changes in economic or market conditions. Statements about the projected growth of the firm’s deposits and other funding, asset liability management and funding strategies and associated interest expense savings are subject to the risk that actual growth and savings may differ, possibly materially from that currently anticipated due to, among other things, changes in interest rates and competition from similar products. Statements about the timing, profitability, benefits and other prospective aspects of business and expense savings initiatives, the achievability of medium and long-term targets, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its ability to implement these initiatives and achieve these targets and goals and may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Statements about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the firm’s business, results, financial position and liquidity are subject to the risk that the actual impact may differ, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these forward-looking statements, investors should not place undue reliance on the firm’s ability to achieve these results. 

Statements about the firm’s pending acquisitions of NN Investment Partners and GreenSky are subject to the risks that the transactions may not close on the timelines contemplated or at all, including due to a failure to obtain requisite regulatory approval, and that the firm may be unable to fully realize the expected benefits or synergies from the acquisitions in the time frames expected or at all. 

For information about some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm’s future results, financial condition and liquidity and the forward-looking statements above, see “Risk 

Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. You should also read the cautionary notes on forward-looking statements in the firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2021 and Earnings Results Presentation for the Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2021. 

The statements in the presentation are current only as of February 17, 2022 and the firm does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances.
