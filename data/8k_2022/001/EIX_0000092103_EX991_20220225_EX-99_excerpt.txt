Business Update February 25 , 2022 

1 Statements contained in this presentation about future performance, including, without limitation, operating results, capital ex penditures, rate base growth, dividend policy, financial outlook, and other statements that are not purely historical, are forward - looking statements. These forward - looking statements r eflect our current expectations; however, such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. These forward - looking stateme nts represent our expectations only as of the date of this presentation, and Edison International assumes no duty to update them to reflect new information, events or circumstances. Im por tant factors that could cause different results include, but are not limited to the: • ability of SCE to recover its costs through regulated rates, including uninsured wildfire - related and debris flow - related costs , costs incurred to mitigate the risk of utility equipment causing future wildfires, costs incurred to implement SCE's new customer service system, costs incurred as a result of the CO VID - 19 pandemic, and increased labor and materials costs due to supply chain constraints and inflation; • ability of SCE to implement its Wildfire Mitigation Plan and capital program; • risks of regulatory or legislative restrictions that would limit SCE’s ability to implement Public Safety Power Shutoff (“PSP S”) when conditions warrant or would otherwise limit SCE’s operational PSPS practices; • risks associated with implementing PSPS, including regulatory fines and penalties, claims for damages and reputational harm; • ability of SCE to maintain a valid safety certification; • ability to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost, including insurance relating to SCE's nuclear facilities and wil dfi re - related claims, and to recover the costs of such insurance or, in the event liabilities exceed insured amounts, the ability to recover uninsured losses from customers or other parties; • extreme weather - related incidents (including events caused, or exacerbated, by climate change, such as wildfires, debris flows, droughts, high wind events and extreme heat events) and other natural disasters (such as earthquakes), which could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage, ope rational issues (such as rotating outages and issues due to damaged infrastructure), PSPS activations and unanticipated costs; • risk that California Assembly Bill 1054 (“AB 1054”) does not effectively mitigate the significant exposure faced by Californi a i nvestor - owned utilities related to liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where utility facilities are alleged to be a substantial cause, including the longevity o f t he Wildfire Insurance Fund and the CPUC's interpretation of and actions under AB 1054, including its interpretation of the prudency standard established under AB 1054; • ability of Edison International and SCE to effectively attract, manage, develop and retain a skilled workforce, including its co ntract workers; • decisions and other actions by the California Public Utilities Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nucl ear Regulatory Commission and other governmental authorities, including decisions and actions related to nationwide or statewide crisis, determinations of authorized rates of re turn or return on equity, the recoverability of wildfire - related and debris flow - related costs, issuance of SCE's wildfire safety certification, wildfire mitigation efforts, approval an d implementation of electrification programs, and delays in executive, regulatory and legislative actions; • ability of Edison International or SCE to borrow funds and access bank and capital markets on reasonable terms; • risks associated with the decommissioning of San Onofre, including those related to worker and public safety, public oppositi on, permitting, governmental approvals, on - site storage of spent nuclear fuel, delays, contractual disputes, and cost overruns; • pandemics, such as COVID - 19, and other events that cause regional, statewide, national or global disruption, which could impact, among other things, Edison International's and SCE's business, operations, cash flows, liquidity and/or financial results and cause Edison International and SCE to incur unantici pat ed costs; • physical security of Edison International's and SCE's critical assets and personnel and the cybersecurity of Edison Internati ona l's and SCE's critical information technology systems for grid control, and business, employee and customer data; • risks associated with cost allocation resulting in higher rates for utility bundled service customers because of possible cus tom er bypass or departure for other electricity providers such as Community Choice Aggregators (“CCA,” which are cities, counties, and certain other public agencies with the authority to g ene rate and/or purchase electricity for their local residents and businesses) and Electric Service Providers (entities that offer electric power and ancillary services to retail customers , o ther than electrical corporations (like SCE) and CCAs); • risks inherent in SCE’s capital investment program, including those related to project site identification, public opposition , e nvironmental mitigation, construction, permitting, changes in the California Independent System Operator’s transmission plans, and governmental approvals; and • risks associated with the operation of electrical facilities, including worker and public safety issues, the risk of utility ass ets causing or contributing to wildfires, failure, availability, efficiency, and output of equipment and facilities, and availability and cost of spare parts. Other important factors are discussed under the headings “Forward - Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussi on and Analysis” in Edison International’s Form 10 - K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our website: www.edisoninvestor.c om.

27 The 2021 fire season marks 3 consecutive years without a catastrophic wildfire associated with SCE’s infrastructure 1 February 25, 2022 SCE’s grid hardening and situational awareness measures ~30% of overhead wires in HFRA with covered conductor 2 1. While there is not universal consensus on the threshold that qualifies a wildfire as “catastrophic,” both OEIS and the SB 901 /AB 1054 statutory framework use the term to guide wildfire mitigation activities and regulatory requirements. For purposes of this presentation, SCE is using OEIS’s definition of a “catastrophic wil dfire,” which is as follows: A wildfire directly causing one or more deaths, damaging or destroying more than 500 structures, or burning more than 140,000 acres of land 2. HFRA = High Fire Risk Areas; refers to distribution infrastructure in HFRA 3. Based on 2021 weather and fuel conditions 4. CAL FIRE positions based on the 2017 - 18 California State Budget as originally enacted and the Governor’s Proposed 2022 - 23 Budget .. Includes all CAL FIRE positions.

28 SCE has made substantial progress on grid hardening and situational awareness measures February 25, 2022 Investments to harden the grid and enhance situational awareness targeted through 2023 Green shading represents completed measures through December 31, 2021, as proportionate to the 2023 forecast in SCE’s 2022 WMP Update filed on February 18, 2022 Covered Conductor ~5,330 circuit miles Fast - Acting Fuses ~14,270 Sectionalizing Devices 174 Wildfire Cameras 196 Weather Stations ~1,708 Targeted by 2023 Total Miles Covered To - Date 1 Tier 3 ~5,700 ~2,110 Tier 2 ~4,000 ~870 Total HFRA ~9,700 ~2,980 Overhead Distribution Lines in HFRA Circuit Miles SCE has focused on deploying covered conductor on the highest - risk circuits first to expeditiously reduce wildfire risk 86% 85% 82% 94% 56% 1. About 200 circuit miles of covered conductor of storm restoration work was distributed evenly between the tiers 

29 SCE is making meaningful progress in mitigating wildfire risk for its customers February 25, 2022 Covered conductor has reduced faults, which could lead to ignitions High fire risk inspection program has reduced remediation needs Expanded vegetation management and tree removal has reduced faults 71% fewer faults on fully covered circuits 1 52% fewer tree - caused faults 2 66% lower defect find rate 3 1. Measured by faults covered conductor is expected to mitigate per 100 circuit miles on fully covered circuits as compared to b are circuits in 2021 in HFRA 2. Measured by average monthly tree caused circuit interruptions in HFRA in 2020 – 2021 as compared to the average from 2015 – 2019 3. Measured as Total Defect Find Rate (percentage of inspections) in 2021 as compared to 2019 (inception of program) for structu res inspected every year 4. Measured as structures damaged or destroyed in wildfires greater than 1,000 acres associated with SCE’s infrastructure during 20 15 – 2020, using red flag warning days as a proxy for PSPS conditions. Please note, however, that a red flag warning, alone, would not necessarily result in a decision to implement a PSPS On segments where SCE has covered bare wire, there has not been a CPUC - reportable ignition from the drivers that covered conductor is expected to mitigate Today’s PSPS use would have prevented majority of damage from past wildfires >90% reduction of structures damaged 4 

30 SCE estimates its wildfire mitigation and PSPS have reduced probability of losses from catastrophic wildfires by ~65 - 70% 1,2 1. Baseline risk estimated by RMS using its wildfire model, the location of SCE’s assets, and SCE reported ignitions from 2014 - 2020 .. Risk reduction calculated by applying SCE - provided mitigation effectiveness and locations of covered conductor, tree removals, inspections, line clearing, and PSPS. Ra nge may vary for other loss thresholds 2. Includes 50,000 year - long simulations using 20 years of weather and fire modeling weighted for the last 5 years to reflect recen t experience and climate - change impacts 3. Annual losses represent potential claims resulting from wildfire. Total potential insured losses, such as damages to assets o f h omeowners and businesses, estimated by RMS, and uninsured losses, such as personal injury, fire suppression, and damage to publicly - owned assets estimated by SCE based on m anagement experience and judgment 4. Fund refers to AB 1054 Wildfire Insurance Fund. SCE used the one - year RMS loss estimates with its estimates for the size of unin sured losses to quantify the reduction in probability of experiencing $3.5 billion in losses over a three - year period, excess of $1 billion aggregate each year, after whi ch the AB 1054 liability cap would apply SCE expects to further reduce risk and decrease the need for PSPS with continued grid hardening investments Pre - 2018 Q4 2021 Estimated Risk Reduction PSPS Contribution Annual Risk of ≥$1.0 billion loss 3 ~7.6% ~2.6% ~65% reduction in estimated probability of accessing the Wildfire Fund Risk of ≥$3.5 billion drawn from Fund over 3 years 3 ~4.2% ~1.3% ~70% reduction in estimated probability of exceeding AB 1054 liability cap 1. Baseline risk estimated by Risk Management Solutions, Inc. (RMS) using its wildfire model, relying on the following data prov ide d by SCE: the location of SCE’s assets, reported ignitions from 2014 – 2020, mitigation effectiveness and locations of installed covered conductor, tree removals, inspections, line clearing, and P SPS de - energization criteria 2. There are risks inherent in the simulation analyses, models and predictions of SCE and RMS relating to the likelihood of and dam age due to wildfires. As with any simulation analysis or model related to physical systems, particularly those with lower frequencies of occurrence and potentially high severity outcomes, the actu al losses from catastrophic wildfire events may differ from the results of the simulation analyses and models of RMS and SCE. Range may vary for other loss thresholds 3. Includes ( i ) total potential insured losses estimated by RMS, and (ii) total potential uninsured losses estimated by SCE based on manage men t experience and consultation with insurance industry experts. “Fund” refers to CA AB 1054 Wildfire Insurance Fund. SCE used RMS loss estimates along with its estimates of uninsur ed losses to quantify the reductions in estimated probability. Q4 2021 results now include a “Post Loss Amplification Factor” which accounts for dimensions like post - event resource scarcity (e.g., la bor, materials) February 25, 2022 30% of total risk reduction vs. 40% as of Q2 2021 Decreasing dependency on PSPS vs. 55% as of Q2 2021 vs. 65% as of Q2 2021

49 Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Management uses core earnings (losses) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings (losses) are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company's performance from period to period. Core earnings (losses) are a non - GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (losses) are defined as earnings attributable to Edison International shareholders less non - core items. Non - core items include income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as write downs, asset impairments and other income and expense related to changes in law, outcomes in tax, regulatory or legal proceedings, and exit activities, including sale of certain assets and other activities that are no longer continuing.
