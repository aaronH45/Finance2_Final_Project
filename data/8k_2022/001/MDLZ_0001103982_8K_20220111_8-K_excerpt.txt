Regulation FD Disclosure.  

Mondelēz International, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “our” or “Mondelēz International”) are furnishing this current report to provide supplemental non-GAAP financial information related to the retrospective impact of (1) our sale of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (“KDP”) shares on August 2, 2021, and (2) our sale of MaxFoods Pty Ltd (“MaxFoods”), an Australian packaged seafood business on November 1, 2021.  

Due to our reporting of KDP’s results on a one-quarter lag basis, the impact of the sale of the KDP shares will affect our non-GAAP financial results beginning with our fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. Consistent with our definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures, we will reflect the partial sale of our equity method investment in KDP as well as the sale of MaxFoods as divestitures. These changes will result in the recasting of our historical non-GAAP financial results and provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results, and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business.  

Change to our Historical Non-GAAP Financial Results in Connection with our Sale of KDP Shares  

As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2021, we sold approximately 14.7 million shares of KDP on August 2, 2021, which reduced our ownership interest by 1.0% to 5.3% of the total outstanding shares. We received $500 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $248 million (or $189 million after tax) during the third quarter of 2021.  

We consider the 1.0% ownership reduction resulting from this sale of shares a partial sale of our equity method investment in KDP. Consistent with our definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures, we consider this sale to be a divestiture. Due to our reporting of KDP’s results on a one-quarter lag basis, the impact of the sale of these shares will affect our non-GAAP financial results beginning with the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. Therefore, we will remove the equity method investment net earnings results related to this partial sale of our equity method investment in KDP from our non-GAAP financial results for Adjusted EPS for all historical periods presented. Our U.S. GAAP results, which include our historical equity method investment net earnings from KDP, will not change from what was previously reported.  

Change to our Historical Non-GAAP Financial Results in Connection with our Sale of MaxFoods  

On November 1, 2021, we completed the sale of MaxFoods, an Australian packaged foods business that we had recently acquired as part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Foods Holdings Pty Ltd. As a result of this divestiture, consistent with the definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures, we will remove the results of this operation from our non-GAAP financial results for Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS for the second and third quarters of 2021 only, as these are the only quarters’ results impacted by this divestiture. Our non-GAAP financial measure for Organic Net Revenue for these periods will not change, as the net revenue from this business was previously included as net revenue from acquisitions which is already excluded from our Organic Net Revenue financial measure. Our U.S. GAAP results, which include the results of the divested operation through the divestiture closing date noted above, will not change from what was previously reported.  

Recast Amounts Reflecting Changes in Historical Non-GAAP Results  

See the summary chart below and Exhibit 99.1 for the unaudited GAAP and recast non-GAAP financial information for the first three quarters of 2021, all quarters of 2020 and 2019, the first nine months of 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. This supplemental disclosure does not amend any disclosure contained in any of our prior SEC filings.
