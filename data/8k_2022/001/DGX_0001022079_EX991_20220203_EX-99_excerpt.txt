SECAUCUS, N.J., February 3, 2022 - Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2021.

"In another unprecedented year, Quest provided critical COVID-19 testing to our country and delivered record revenues, earnings and cash from operations for full year 2021," said Steve Rusckowski, Chairman, CEO and President. "At the same time, our base business revenues grew more than 19 percent year over year, achieving record levels.

"Quest is well positioned in 2022 to deliver on our commitments. Our guidance for 2022 reflects lower demand for COVID-19 testing services; growth in the base business; and the impact of the previously announced one-year delay of PAMA cuts, partially offset by investments to accelerate growth.

"I am proud of the incredible accomplishments of our 50,000 Quest employees throughout the pandemic. They have risen to the challenge of bringing COVID-19 testing to millions of patients – all the while innovating, persevering, and remaining committed to our vision of empowering better health. Our team is strong, the business has momentum, and Quest’s future is bright."

(b)For further details impacting the year-over-year comparisons related to operating income, operating income as a percentage of net revenues, net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, and diluted EPS, see note 2 of the financial tables attached below.

(c)The sum of reported and adjusted diluted EPS for the four quarters of 2021 did not equal the total for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to both quarterly fluctuations in our earnings and in the weighted average common shares outstanding throughout the year as a result of the impact of accelerated share repurchase agreements ("ASR") that we entered into during April 2021.

Dividend Increased

Quest Diagnostics' Board of Directors authorized a 6.5% increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.62 to $0.66 per share, or $2.64 per share annually, starting with the dividend payable on April 20, 2022 to shareholders of record of Quest Diagnostics common stock on April 6, 2022. This dividend increase is the company's eleventh since 2011.

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures

As used in this press release the term “reported” refers to measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The term “adjusted” refers to non-GAAP operating performance measures that exclude special items such as restructuring and integration charges, certain financial impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, amortization expense, excess tax benefits ("ETB") associated with stock-based compensation, a gain on remeasurement of an equity interest, costs associated with donations, contributions, and other financial support through Quest for Health Equity, our initiative with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation to reduce health disparities in underserved communities, a gain on sale of an ownership interest in a joint venture, gains associated with changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments, and other items.

Non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. Non-GAAP adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. Management may use these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, as well as to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess our performance. The additional tables attached below include reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted measures to GAAP measures.

(a)For both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, represents costs primarily associated with systems conversions and integration incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of restructuring and integration charges on our consolidated statements of operations: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(b)For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the pre-tax impact primarily represents costs associated with donations, contributions, and other financial support through Quest for Health Equity and changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments, partially offset by a gain recognized by an equity method investee to adjust an investment to fair value. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the pre-tax impact primarily represents changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments and a gain recognized by an equity method investee to adjust certain of its investments to fair value, partially offset by costs associated with Quest for Health Equity, and a non-cash impairment charge to the carrying value of an equity method investment. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, primarily represents a gain recognized by an equity method investee to adjust certain of its investments to fair value, a loss on retirement of debt, and, to a lesser extent, costs associated with Quest for Health Equity. 

The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of these other items on our consolidated statement of operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(c)For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the pre-tax impact represents a gain of $314 million recorded in other income, net following the sale of our 40% ownership interest in Q2 Solutions®, our clinical trials central 

9

laboratory services joint venture, to IQVIA Holdings, Inc., our joint venture partner, for $760 million in an all-cash transaction.

(d)For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the pre-tax impact represents the impact of certain items resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, includes incremental costs incurred to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers. For both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, principally includes expense associated with payments to eligible employees to help offset expenses they incurred as a result of COVID-19 and incremental costs incurred primarily to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers. The twelve months ended December 31, 2020 also includes certain asset impairment charges.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of these items on our consolidated statements of operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(e)For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the pre-tax impact represents a gain of $70 million recognized in other income, net based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of an equity interest. On August 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 56% interest in Mid America Clinical Laboratories, LLC ("MACL") from our joint venture partners. As a result of the transaction, we remeasured our previously held minority interest in MACL to fair value and recognized a gain. 

(f)For restructuring and integration charges, COVID-19 impacts, other items and amortization expense, income tax impacts, where recorded, were primarily calculated using combined statutory income tax rates of 25.5% for both 2021 and 2020. For the gain on sale of ownership in joint venture in 2021, income tax expense on the transaction resulted in an effective income rate of 17.6%. For the gain on remeasurement of equity interest in 2020, income tax expense on the transaction resulted in an effective income tax rate of 11.8%. 

3)For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our common stock for a value of $0.6 billion, including 1.6 million shares repurchased under an ASR. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased 16.0 million shares of our common stock for $2.2 billion, including 10.7 million shares repurchased under an ASR. In each of February and March 2021, our Board of Directors increased the size of our share repurchase program by $1 billion. As of December 31, 2021, $0.7 billion remained available under our share repurchase authorization.

4)During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we received $138 million of funds that were appropriated to healthcare providers under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we returned the funds and net cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of the repayment.

5)The outlook for adjusted diluted EPS represents management’s estimates for the full year 2022 before the impact of special items. Further impacts to earnings related to special items may occur throughout 2022. Additionally, the amount of ETB is dependent upon employee stock option exercises and our stock price, and changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments are based on fluctuations in the investees' stock price, both of which are difficult to predict. The following table reconciles our 2022 outlook for diluted EPS determined under GAAP to our outlook for adjusted diluted EPS:
