Motorola Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”) is pleased to announce that, effective as of February 15, 2022, the size of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) will be increased from seven to eight members and Dr. Ayanna M. Howard will join the Board as a director and a member of the Audit Committee. The Board took these actions to increase the size of the Board and elect Dr. Howard to the Board and the Audit Committee on January 16, 2022. Dr. Howard will serve until the Company’s 2022 annual meeting of shareholders and the election and qualification of her successor or, if earlier, her death or resignation from the Board.  

Dr. Howard will receive the standard compensation received by non-employee directors. This compensation arrangement is described in the Company’s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed on April 1, 2021 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As disclosed in the definitive proxy statement, a non-employee director will receive his or her equity compensation in the form of a grant of deferred stock units (prorated based on the number of full months served until the next annual meeting of shareholders) with a value of $15,833.33 per month, divided by the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the day on which the director’s election to the Board is effective.  

There are no arrangements or understandings between Dr. Howard and any other person pursuant to which Dr. Howard was elected as a director of the Company, nor does Dr. Howard have any direct or indirect material interest in any related party transaction required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
