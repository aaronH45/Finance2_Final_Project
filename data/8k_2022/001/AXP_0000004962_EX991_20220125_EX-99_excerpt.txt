New York – January 25, 2022 – American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) today reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.7 billion, or $2.18 per share, compared with net income of $1.4 billion, or $1.76 per share, a year ago.

"We delivered strong fourth-quarter and full-year results that exceeded our expectations thanks to the efforts of our dedicated and talented colleagues," said Stephen J. Squeri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

"Our investment strategy enabled us to reach record levels of Card Member spending, maintain customer retention and satisfaction above pre-pandemic levels, increase new Card acquisitions, grow our loan balances, and deepen our digital engagement with customers, producing revenue growth of 30 percent in the fourth quarter and 17 percent for the full year.

"As we look ahead, we are raising our aspiration to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long term with a new growth plan that will enable us to continue investing at high levels in our customers, brand, and talent. Our performance to date and the lessons we have learned have strengthened our conviction in this strategy.

"Based on our new growth plan and the benefits we anticipate from an improving macro environment, we expect to generate elevated levels of revenue growth in 2022 in the range of 18 to 20 percent and earnings per share of $9.25 to $9.65. Longer term, as the economy reaches a steady state, our aspiration is to achieve revenue growth in excess of 10 percent and EPS growth in the mid-teens."

The company also plans to increase the regular quarterly dividend on its common shares outstanding by approximately 20 percent, from 43 cents to 52 cents per share beginning with the first quarter 2022, subject to approval by the company's board of directors. 

Fourth-quarter consolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $12.1 billion, up 30 percent from $9.4 billion a year ago. The increase primarily reflected growth in Card Member spending compared to the prior year.

Consolidated provisions for credit losses were $53 million, compared with a benefit of $111 million a year ago. The change in provisions primarily reflected lower reserve releases compared with a year ago, partially offset by lower net write-offs in the current quarter, with credit metrics remaining near historic lows.

Consolidated expenses were $9.8 billion, up 29 percent from $7.6 billion a year ago, reflecting higher marketing investments to continue building growth momentum, increased costs driven by higher Card Member spending, and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Operating expenses were also higher primarily as a result of increased compensation.

The consolidated effective tax rate was 25.5 percent, up from 22.6 percent a year ago. The increase primarily reflected discrete tax charges in the current quarter and changes in the level and geographic mix of income.

For the full year, the company reported net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, compared with net income of $3.1 billion, or $3.77 per share, a year ago.

Consolidated total revenues net of interest expense for the full year were $42.4 billion, up 17 percent from $36.1 billion a year ago. The increase primarily reflected growth in Card Member spending compared to the prior year.

Consolidated provisions for credit losses for the full year resulted in a benefit of $1.4 billion, compared with a provision expense of $4.7 billion a year ago. The decrease reflected reserve releases of $2.5 billion, compared with a reserve build of $1.5 billion a year ago, as well as lower net write-offs in the current year. 

Consolidated expenses for the full year were $33.1 billion, up 22 percent from $27.1 billion a year ago, reflecting increased costs driven by higher Card Member spending, higher marketing investments to continue building growth momentum, and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Operating expenses were flat, reflecting increased compensation, offset by net gains on Amex Ventures equity investments.

Global Consumer Services Group reported fourth-quarter pretax income of $1.3 billion, compared with $1.5 billion a year ago.

Total revenues net of interest expense were $6.9 billion, up 23 percent from $5.7 billion a year ago. The rise primarily reflected an increase in Card Member spending compared to the prior year.

Provisions for credit losses were $27 million, down 37 percent from $43 million a year ago. The decrease primarily reflected lower net write-offs in the current quarter, partially offset by a smaller reserve release compared with a year ago. 

Total expenses were $5.6 billion, up 35 percent from $4.2 billion a year ago. The increase primarily reflected higher customer engagement costs and operating expenses. Customer engagement costs were up due to higher marketing investments to continue building growth momentum, as well as higher costs driven by increasing Card Member spending and usage of travel-related benefits. Operating expenses were higher primarily as a result of increased compensation. 

Global Commercial Services reported fourth-quarter pretax income of $706 million, compared with $667 million a year ago.

Total revenues net of interest expense were $3.6 billion, up 30 percent from $2.7 billion a year ago, primarily reflecting a rise in Card Member spending compared to the prior year.

Provisions for credit losses were $26 million, compared with a benefit of $164 million a year ago. The change primarily reflected a smaller reserve release compared with a year ago, partially offset by lower net write-offs in the current quarter. 

Total expenses were $2.8 billion, up 27 percent from $2.2 billion a year ago, primarily reflecting higher customer engagement costs and operating expenses. Customer engagement costs were up due to higher marketing investments to continue building growth momentum, as well as higher costs driven by increasing Card Member spending and usage of travel-related benefits. Operating expenses were higher primarily as a result of increased compensation.

Global Merchant and Network Services reported fourth-quarter pretax income of $508 million, compared with $276 million a year ago.

Total revenues net of interest expense were $1.5 billion, up 31 percent from $1.1 billion a year ago. The rise primarily reflected an increase in network volumes compared to the prior year.

Total expenses were $946 million, up 15 percent from $823 million a year ago, reflecting higher marketing investments and operating expenses, primarily driven by increased compensation.

Corporate and Other reported a fourth-quarter pretax loss of $209 million, compared with a pretax loss of $545 million a year ago. The decline was primarily driven by a non-cash gain related to an increase in American Express Global Business Travel's total equity book value.
