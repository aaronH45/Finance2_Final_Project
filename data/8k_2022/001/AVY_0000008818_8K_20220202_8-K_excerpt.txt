“Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  

Certain statements contained in this Form 8-K and the exhibits attached hereto are forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements, and financial or other business targets, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements also include those related to the acquisition of Vestcom, including its anticipated benefits, financing and effect on the Company’s long-term targets and future financial results.  

The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its financial performance in the near-term include: (i) the impacts to underlying demand for the Company’s products and/or foreign currency fluctuations from global economic conditions, political uncertainty, changes in environmental standards and governmental regulations, including as a result of COVID-19; (ii) competitors’ actions, including pricing, expansion in key markets, and product offerings; (iii) the degree to which higher costs can be offset with productivity measures and/or passed on to customers through price increases, without a significant loss of volume; and (iv) the execution and integration of acquisitions, including the acquisition of Vestcom.  

Actual results and trends may differ materially from historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors, including but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the following:  

   ●    

COVID-19   

   ●    

International Operations – worldwide and local economic and market conditions; changes in political conditions; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations, including in emerging markets

   ●    

The Company’s Vestcom Acquisition – risks related to future opportunities and plans for the combined company, including the uncertainty of expected future financial performance and results of the combined company; unknown liabilities; and the possibility that, if the Company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, the market price of the Company’s common stock could decline  

   ●    

Income Taxes – fluctuations in tax rates; changes in tax laws and regulations, and uncertainties associated with interpretations of such laws and regulations; retention of tax incentives; outcome of tax audits; and the realization of deferred tax assets  

   ●    

Information Technology – disruptions in information technology systems, including cyber-attacks or other intrusions to network security; successful installation of new or upgraded information technology systems; and data security breaches  

   ●    

Human Capital – recruitment and retention of employees; fluctuations in employee benefit costs; and collective labor arrangements  

   ●    

The Company’s Indebtedness – credit risks; the Company’s ability to obtain adequate financing arrangements and maintain access to capital; volatility of financial markets; fluctuations in interest rates; and compliance with the Company’s debt covenants  

   ●    

Ownership of the Company’s Stock – potential significant variability of the Company’s stock price and amounts of future dividends and share repurchases  

   ●    

Legal and Regulatory Matters – protection and infringement of intellectual property and impact of legal and regulatory proceedings, including with respect to environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and trade compliance
