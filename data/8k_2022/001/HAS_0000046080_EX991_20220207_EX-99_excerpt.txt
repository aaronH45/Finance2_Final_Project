Pawtucket, R.I., February 7, 2022 -- Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ: HAS), a global play and entertainment company, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021. 

"The Hasbro team finished the year strong and delivered an exceptional full-year 2021, including another record revenue year for Wizards of the Coast; strong revenue growth for consumer products; and a robust, progressively more Hasbro brand-led, content slate to return to 2019 levels of deliveries for entertainment," said Rich Stoddart, Hasbro interim chief executive officer. "Fans and consumers are increasingly interacting with brands in more ways than ever—our unique set of strategic assets across toys and games, entertainment, digital gaming and licensing provide the foundation for maximizing the value of both our existing franchises and new IP. 

"It has been an honor to lead this talented team over the past several months and I am confident that Chris Cocks will bring tremendous vision and passion while accelerating our performance-driven culture as he takes over as CEO on February 25th," continued Stoddart. 

"Throughout 2021, and finishing with focused execution in the fourth quarter, the Hasbro team did an excellent job in unprecedented circumstances," said Deborah Thomas, Hasbro chief financial officer. "We delivered strong results, including 17% revenue growth for the year, higher operating profit margins and $818 million in operating cash flow, while successfully navigating supply chain challenges, including higher fourth quarter input and freight costs across our business. This enabled us to continue investing in growth initiatives, pay off $1.08 billion in long-term debt in 2021 and continue supporting our dividend which the Board increased 3% today.

"Long-term investments in our brands and capabilities have built a differentiated business with diversified capabilities to drive long-term profitable growth and enhance shareholder value," continued Thomas.

Supercharging the Brand Blueprint: Fourth Quarter & Full-Year 2021 Brand Performance 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1Hasbro's total gaming category, including all gaming revenue, most notably MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY, which are reported in the Franchise Brands portfolio, totaled $555.7 million for the fourth quarter 2021, down 1% compared to the respective period in 2020, and $2.10 billion for the full-year 2021, up 19% versus 2020. 

Brand Blueprint 2021 Highlights

For the full-year 2021, revenues grew in all brand portfolio categories: Franchise Brands, Partner Brands, Hasbro Gaming, Emerging Brands and TV/Film/Entertainment. Top brand performances included MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF, PEPPA PIG, MY LITTLE PONY and TRANSFORMERS, as well as robust growth in Hasbro products for the Marvel portfolio, led by the Spider-Man franchise including products in support of the feature film Spider-Man: No Way Home and the new animated show Spidey and his Amazing Friends.

Gaming Leadership 

•Hasbro's face-to-face, tabletop and digital gaming portfolio posted strong growth and ranks among the biggest and fastest growing portfolios in the industry. 

•Hasbro's total gaming portfolio revenue, including Franchise Brands MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY, grew 19% to $2.1 billion. 

•MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenue was up significantly driven primarily by tabletop revenues. MAGIC: THE GATHERING grew for its fourth consecutive year and has now grown in 12 of the last 13 years. 

•DUNGEONS & DRAGONS revenue grew for the ninth consecutive year. 

•Digital gaming revenues increased 36%. 

•Hasbro Gaming revenues, which exclude Franchise Brand gaming brands, grew 4% year-over-year and is up 20% versus 2019

Entertainment Brand Leadership

•My Little Pony: A New Generation relaunched the MY LITTLE PONY brand through the successful animated feature film on Netflix that was #1 in the Netflix Kids Top 10 in more than 80 countries on opening weekend, driving high viewership and audience engagement; and, in keeping with the Brand Blueprint, driving greater than 100% growth in toy and game point of sale in the fourth quarter versus last year; double-digit growth in licensed merchandise revenues for the year; and the beginning of a multi-year eOne-led content road map. 

•The successful launch of Hasbro toy and games for PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS delivered higher revenue and operating profit as these brands were monetized through the Brand Blueprint in toys, games, digital gaming, licensed products and entertainment. The launch contributed to share gains in the global preschool toy category and the brands are well positioned heading into 2022 as the first full year of global product availability. 

•Leveraging Hasbro's unique ability to develop and merchandise key brands across the business, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS feature film finished principal photography during 2021 and is currently in post-production.

Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2021 Major Segment Performance

Beginning with the first quarter 2021, Hasbro realigned its financial reporting segments and business units, in order to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. The three principal reportable segments are: Consumer Products, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, and Entertainment. 

Reclassifications of certain prior year segment results have been made to conform to the current-year presentation. None of the segment changes impact the Company's previously reported consolidated net revenue, operating profit, EBITDA, net earnings or net earnings per diluted share.

1Reconciliations are included in the attached schedules under the heading "Reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Profit" and “Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.”

Consumer Products segment revenue increased 9% and operating profit increased 30% to 10.1% of revenue, a 170-basis point expansion, for the full-year 2021. The team drove significant growth in Hasbro's products for the Marvel portfolio, as well as key Hasbro brands including NERF, TRANSFORMERS and PLAY-DOH, and successfully launched Hasbro's toy and game line for PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS. Franchise Brands, Partner Brands and Emerging Brands revenue increased in the segment for the year. Hasbro Gaming declined versus a strong 2020, but was up 11% versus the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. Revenue grew in all geographic regions and in licensed consumer products. eComm revenue grew 10% to $1.26 billion totaling 29% of Hasbro toy and game revenues. The team executed at a high level to deliver a strong finish to the year amid ongoing supply chain challenges. Operating profit and margin improved for the year behind higher shipments to meet strong demand as well as the positive impact of 

price increases, which were partially offset by significantly higher freight and distribution expenses. Adjusted EBITDA grew 18% for the full year.

Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenue increased 42% and operating profit increased 30% for the full-year 2021. Tabletop and digital gaming revenues grew behind several record set releases for MAGIC: THE GATHERING and continued growth in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Wizards of the Coast exceeded $1 billion in revenues, successfully doubling its revenue two years ahead of target. Licensed digital gaming revenue also increased double digits for the year. Operating profit grew behind increased revenues which were partially offset by higher digital game depreciation, product development and advertising to support growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. In addition, the Company continues to invest in developing future digital gaming and development of new Wizards IP. Based on these investments for the future and the sequence of game releases, these costs had a more pronounced impact in the fourth quarter 2021. Operating profit margin was 42.5% and adjusted EBITDA grew 36% for the year.

Entertainment segment revenue increased 27%, exceeding 2019 levels of revenue when adjusted for the results of the music business. Operating loss for the year decreased 35% and adjusted operating profit grew 13% for the full-year 2021. Fourth quarter revenues were 54% above last year and 70% higher than pro forma 2019. 33% growth in Film and TV revenue combined with 54% growth in Family Brands drove the segment's full-year performance. In the third quarter, Hasbro sold the music business, which represented $65.2 million in revenue and $16.9 million in operating profit during the first half of the year. During the year we delivered 229 half hours of scripted television content; 695 half hours of unscripted television content; acquired 236 half hours of third-party produced television content; produced seven feature films; and completed production on 6 series of animated content. All metrics were up year-over-year. Television revenues grew with deliveries of Yellowjackets, Cruel Summer, Graymail and The Rookie, as well as sales of other scripted and unscripted programs. New film releases and deliveries are improving, and revenues grew led by Clifford the Big Red Dog, Come From Away and Finch. The successful Netflix release of My Little Pony: A New Generation supported Family Brands revenue growth in the year, along with content sales for Peppa Pig and PJ Masks and higher YouTube advertising revenues. Adjusted operating profit increased due to higher revenue and lower administrative costs, partially offset by higher program cost amortization associated with higher deliveries and the mix of content. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment grew 76% for the full year.

Company Outlook

Coming off a strong year in 2021, the Company has a plan for continued growth in 2022, including revenue and operating profit growth at a low-single digit rate for the year, and operating cash flow in the range of $700 to $800 million.

For 2023, the Company is planning significant initiatives to be executed across the Brand Blueprint in consumer products, gaming and entertainment; including, feature films for Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS which are expected to accelerate revenue and operating profit growth that year. For full-year 2023, operating profit margin is expected to exceed 16% and operating cash flow should reach approximately $1 billion.

For the medium term, through year-end 2024, Hasbro expects revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a compound annual basis including mid-single digit growth over the period for Consumer Products and high single to low double-digit growth in both the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment and the Entertainment Segment.

Debt Repayment 

Hasbro retired $1.08 billion of long-term debt in 2021. Combined with the 23% growth in Adjusted EBITDA, the Company reduced its gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio by 1.7X to 3.1X and remains on track to return to its 2.0 to 2.5X target by year-end 2023. 

A share repurchase program continues to be an important long-term component of Hasbro’s capital allocation strategy and Hasbro has $367 million available under its authorized share repurchase programs. We anticipate resuming share repurchase when it is not expected to materially impact the timeline to reach leverage targets. The Company believes this could be in the second half of 2023 or sooner, depending on business performance and other factors. 

Dividend 

The Company announced today that the Board of Directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend 3% to $0.70 per common share. The dividend will be payable on May 16, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 2, 2022. During the fourth quarter, Hasbro paid $93.8 million in cash dividends to shareholders, bringing the full-year payments to $374.5 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The financial tables accompanying this press release include non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, specifically Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted net earnings and Adjusted net earnings per diluted share, which exclude, where applicable, acquisition and related costs, acquired intangible amortization, loss on disposal of business and related costs, severance, UK Tax Reform, stock acceleration and net loss on Discovery investment. Also included in this press release are the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net earnings attributable to Hasbro, Inc. excluding interest expense, income tax expense, net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Segment EBITDA represents segment operating profit (loss) plus other income or expense, less depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the impact of stock compensation (including stock acceleration expense and acquisition-related stock expense), acquisition-related costs, loss on disposal of business and related costs, severance and net loss on Discovery investment. As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliations on the attached schedules of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted net earnings per diluted share and Adjusted operating profit provide investors with an understanding of the underlying performance of our business absent unusual events. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of our business because they reflect the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet and make strategic acquisitions. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP as more fully discussed in our consolidated financial statements and filings with the SEC. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
