FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  

January 20, 2022   

M&T BANK CORPORATION ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS  

BUFFALO, NEW YORK -- M&T Bank Corporation (“M&T”) (NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the full year and quarter ended December 31, 2021.  

GAAP Results of Operations. Diluted earnings per common share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) were $3.37 in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $3.52 in the year-earlier quarter and $3.69 in the third quarter of 2021. GAAP-basis net income was $458 million in the recent quarter, $471 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $495 million in the third 2021 quarter. GAAP-basis net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common shareholders' equity was 1.15% and 10.91%, respectively, compared with 1.30% and 12.07%, respectively, in the similar 2020 period and 1.28% and 12.16%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2021. Included in noninterest expenses in the recent quarter were merger-related expenses associated with M&T’s proposed acquisition of People’s United Financial, Inc. of $21 million ($16 million after-tax effect, or $.12 of diluted earnings per common share), compared with $9 million ($7 million after-tax effect, or $.05 of diluted earnings per common share) in the third quarter of 2021. There were no merger-related expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Darren J. King, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented on M&T’s results, “Despite last year’s challenging environment, M&T realized significant increases in both diluted earnings per share and net income. These results reflect our prudent credit underwriting, improved economic conditions and growth in noninterest income. Our capital position remains very strong. During the year we saw our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increase to 11.4% from 10.0% at the end of 2020. Looking forward, we stand ready to complete our acquisition of People’s United and to strategically deploy our excess liquidity and capital as we manage through a likely period of rising interest rates and elevated inflation.”

For the year ended December 31, 2021 diluted earnings per common share were $13.80, up 39% from $9.94 in 2020. GAAP-basis net income in 2021 totaled $1.86 billion, improved significantly from $1.35 billion in 2020. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common shareholders’ equity, GAAP-basis net income in 2021 was 1.22% and 11.54%, respectively, and 1.00% and 8.72%, respectively, in 2020. Merger-related expenses in 2021 were $44 million ($34 million after-tax effect, or $.25 of diluted earnings per common share). There were no merger-related expenses in 2020. 

Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations. M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a “net operating” or “tangible” basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill and core deposit and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&T (when incurred), since such items are considered by management to be “nonoperating” in nature. The amounts of such “nonoperating” expenses are presented in the tables that accompany this release. Although “net operating income” as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. 

Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.50 in the final quarter of 2021, compared with $3.54 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $3.76 in the third quarter of 2021. Net operating income aggregated $475 million in the recent quarter, $473 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $504 million in 2021’s third quarter. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity, net operating income in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 1.23% and 15.98%, respectively, 1.35% and 17.53%, respectively, in the similar quarter of 2020 and 1.34% and 17.54%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2021. 

Diluted net operating earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $14.11 and $10.02, respectively. Net operating income in 2021 was $1.90 billion, compared with $1.36 billion in 2020. Net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders’ equity was 1.28% and 16.80%, respectively, in 2021 and 1.04% and 12.79%, respectively, in 2020. 

Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income. Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis totaled $937 million in the recent quarter, down from $993 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $971 million in the third quarter of 2021. The decrease compared with the earlier quarters reflects lower outstanding average loan balances and a reduced net interest margin. Average loans outstanding and the net interest margin were $93.3 billion and 2.58%, respectively, in the recent quarter, compared with $98.7 billion and 3.00%, respectively, in the year earlier quarter and $95.3 billion and 2.74%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2021. Outstanding loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) averaged $1.65 billion in 2021’s fourth quarter, compared with $6.18 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $3.26 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Interest

income from PPP loans, including recognition of fees associated with repaid loans, was $41 million in the recent quarter, compared with $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $71 million in the third quarter of 2021. Taxable equivalent net interest income for the full year of 2021 was $3.84 billion and in 2020 was $3.88 billion. Average loans outstanding were $96.6 billion in each of 2021 and 2020, but the net interest margin declined to 2.76% in 2021 from 3.16% in 2020. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality. Reflecting improvements in economic conditions and the credit environment, recaptures of the provision for credit losses of $15 million and $20 million were recorded in the fourth and third quarters of 2021, respectively, compared with a provision of $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. A recapture of $75 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $800 million of provision for credit losses in 2020. Net loan charge-offs were $31 million during the recent quarter, compared with $97 million in the final quarter of 2020 and $40 million in the third quarter of 2021. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .13% and .39% in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively, and .17% in the third quarter of 2021. Net loan charge-offs during all of 2021 and 2020 aggregated $192 million and $247 million, respectively, representing .20% and .26%, respectively, of average loans outstanding. 

Loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $2.06 billion at December 31, 2021, up from $1.89 billion at December 31, 2020, but down from $2.24 billion at September 30, 2021. As a percentage of loans outstanding, nonaccrual loans were 2.22%, 1.92% and 2.40% at December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $24 million at December 31, 2021, $35 million a year earlier and $25 million at September 30, 2021. 

Allowance for Credit Losses. M&T regularly performs comprehensive analyses of its loan portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. As a result of those analyses, the allowance for credit losses totaled $1.47 billion or 1.58% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2021, compared with $1.74 billion or 1.76% at December 31, 2020 and $1.52 billion or 1.62% at September 30, 2021. The allowance at December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and September 30, 2021 represented 1.60%, 1.86%, and 1.66%, respectively, of total loans on those dates, excluding outstanding balances of PPP loans.

Predominantly government-guaranteed residential real estate loans. 

Noninterest Income and Expense. Noninterest income was $579 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $551 million in the year-earlier quarter and $569 million in the third quarter of 2021. As compared with the final quarter of 2020, the increased level of noninterest income in the recent quarter resulted largely from higher trust income, service charges on deposit accounts and brokerage services income. The final quarter of 2021 and 2020 each reflected a $30 million distribution from Bayview Lending Group LLC (“BLG”). Compared with the third quarter of 2021, higher noninterest income in the recent quarter reflected the distribution from BLG and increased trust income, offset by lower mortgage banking revenues that reflect M&T’s decision to retain recently originated mortgage loans in portfolio rather than sell such loans. No distributions from BLG were received in the third quarter of 2021. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest income rose to $2.17 billion in 2021 from $2.09 billion in 2020. The increase resulted from a $43 million, or 7%, increase in trust income and higher service charges on deposit accounts and brokerage services income, partially offset by lower trading account and foreign exchange gains.

Noninterest expense totaled $928 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $845 million in the corresponding quarter of 2020 and $899 million in the third quarter of 2021. Excluding expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature, such as amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $904 million in the recent quarter, $842 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $888 million in 2021’s third quarter. Factors contributing to the increase in noninterest operating expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the year-earlier quarter were higher costs for salaries and employee benefits (including increased incentive compensation expenses), outside data processing and software, and professional services. As compared with the third quarter of 2021, the greater level of noninterest operating expenses in the recent quarter resulted largely from seasonally higher advertising and marketing costs, increased salaries and employee benefits, and a rise in outside data processing and software. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the year ended December 31, 2021, noninterest expense was $3.61 billion compared with $3.39 billion in 2020. Noninterest operating expenses aggregated $3.56 billion in 2021 and $3.37 billion in 2020. As compared with the prior year, salaries and employee benefits (predominantly incentive compensation expenses), outside data processing and software, and professional services were higher in 2021. 

The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), measures the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. M&T's efficiency ratio was 59.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021, 54.6% in the year-earlier quarter and 57.7% in the third quarter of 2021. The efficiency ratio for the full year 2021 was 59.0%, compared with 56.3% in 2020. 

Balance Sheet. M&T had total assets of $155.1 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $142.6 billion and $151.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, were $92.9 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $98.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $93.6 billion at September 30, 2021. The lower level of loans and leases at the recent quarter-end as compared with December 31, 2020 reflects a $4.1 billion decline in commercial loans resulting from reduced

M&T BANK CORPORATION 

balances of PPP loans outstanding. PPP loans totaled $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $5.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and $2.2 billion at September 30, 2021. Total deposits were $131.5 billion at the recent quarter-end, $119.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and $128.7 billion at September 30, 2021. The higher amount of deposits at the two most recent quarter-ends as compared with December 31, 2020 resulted from increased non-interest bearing deposits. 

Total shareholders' equity was $17.9 billion, or 11.54% of total assets at December 31, 2021, $16.2 billion, or 11.35% at December 31, 2020 and $17.5 billion, or 11.54% at September 30, 2021. Common shareholders' equity was $16.2 billion, or $125.51 per share, at December 31, 2021, compared with $14.9 billion, or $116.39 per share, a year-earlier and $15.8 billion, or $122.60 per share, at September 30, 2021. Tangible equity per common share was $89.80 at December 31, 2021, $80.52 at December 31, 2020 and $86.88 at September 30, 2021. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, common shareholders' equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances. M&T estimates that the ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets under regulatory capital rules was approximately 11.4% at December 31, 2021, up from 11.1% three months earlier and 10.0% at December 31, 2020.
