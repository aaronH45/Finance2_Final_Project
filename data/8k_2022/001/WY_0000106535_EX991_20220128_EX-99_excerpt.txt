SEATTLE, January 28, 2022 – Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported fourth quarter net earnings of $416 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $2.2 billion. This compares with net earnings of $292 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion for the same period last year and net earnings of $482 million for the third quarter of 2021. Excluding a total after-tax benefit of $49 million for special items, the company reported fourth quarter net earnings of $367 million, or 49 cents per diluted share. This compares with net earnings before special items of $361 million for the same period last year and $450 million for the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $674 million compared with $657 million for the same period last year and $746 million for the third quarter of 2021. 

For the full year 2021, Weyerhaeuser reported record net earnings of $2.6 billion, or $3.47 per diluted share, on net sales of $10.2 billion. This compares with net earnings of $797 million on net sales of $7.5 billion for the full year 2020. Full year 2021 includes a total after-tax benefit of $81 million for special items. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $2.5 billion, or $3.37 per diluted share. This compares with net earnings before special items of $962 million for the full year 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2021 was a record $4.1 billion compared with $2.2 billion for full year 2020. 

This morning, the company declared a $1.45 per share supplemental dividend. On a combined basis, including dividends and share repurchase, the company is returning more than $2 billion of cash, or 79 percent of 2021 Adjusted FAD, to shareholders based on our 2021 results.  

“Our 2021 financial performance was the strongest on record and each of our businesses delivered exceptional results despite persistent operational and market challenges,” said Devin W. Stockfish, president and chief executive officer. “Our teams delivered the highest Wood Products Adjusted EBITDA on record, captured over $70 million of operational excellence improvements, optimized our timberlands holdings through strategic transactions in Alabama and Washington, and launched our new Natural Climate Solutions business. As we enter 2022, we continue to be encouraged by strong demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses and remain focused on creating superior value for shareholders through our unmatched portfolio of assets, industry-leading operating performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation.”

(1)  

Net earnings before special items is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides helpful context in understanding the company’s earnings performance. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the company. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items. Net earnings before special items and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, and are not intended to represent an alternative to, our GAAP results. Reconciliations of Net earnings before special items and Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP earnings are included within this release. 

(2)  

Fourth quarter 2021 after-tax special items include a $28 million product remediation insurance recovery, a $12 million noncash legal benefit and a $9 million insurance recovery. Special items for prior periods presented are included in the reconciliation tables within this release. 

(3)  

Adjusted Funds Available for Distribution (Adjusted FAD) is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to evaluate the company’s liquidity. Adjusted FAD, as we define it, is net cash from operations adjusted for capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items. Adjusted FAD measures cash generated during the period (net of capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items) that is available for dividends, repurchases of common shares, debt reduction, acquisitions, and other discretionary and nondiscretionary capital allocation activities. Adjusted FAD should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our GAAP results. A reconciliation of Adjusted FAD to net cash from operations is included within this release. 

TIMBERLANDS 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Q4 2021 Performance – In the West, fee harvest volumes were slightly higher than the third quarter and per unit log and haul costs were lower. Domestic sales realizations were comparable and export sales realizations were slightly higher, driven by strong demand in Japan. In the South, sales realizations for sawlogs and fiber logs increased slightly as mills continued to bolster inventories, and fee harvest volumes were modestly higher as weather conditions improved from the third quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly higher, primarily due to increased transportation costs. 

Q1 2022 Outlook – Weyerhaeuser anticipates first quarter earnings and Adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter. In the West, the company expects significantly higher domestic sales realizations and fee harvest volumes, moderately higher export sales realizations, and seasonally lower forestry and road costs. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be moderately lower than the fourth quarter. In the South, the company expects comparable sales realizations and seasonally lower forestry and road costs. This is expected to be offset by slightly higher per unit log and haul costs and slightly lower fee harvest volumes. 

REAL ESTATE, ENERGY & NATURAL RESOURCES 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Q4 2021 Performance – Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA decreased from the third quarter due to lower real estate sales. The number of acres sold decreased due to the timing of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average price per acre due to the mix of properties sold. The segment reported full year Adjusted EBITDA of $296 million. 

Q1 2022 Outlook – Weyerhaeuser expects first quarter earnings and Adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than first quarter 2021 due to an increase in real estate acres sold. The company anticipates full year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA for the segment will be approximately $300 million.

WOOD PRODUCTS 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Q4 2021 Performance – Sales realizations for lumber increased by 15 percent compared with the third quarter average, which was more than offset by a 29 percent decrease for oriented strand board. Sales volumes were significantly lower than the third quarter for lumber and slightly lower for oriented strand board, largely due to weather-related transportation challenges in Canada. Raw material costs for engineered wood products were significantly lower, primarily for oriented strand board webstock. Sales realizations improved across most engineered wood products, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to planned maintenance. Distribution commodity product margins were significantly higher, slightly offset by seasonally lower sales volumes.  

Fourth quarter pretax special items include a $37 million product remediation recovery and a $13 million insurance recovery.  

Q1 2022 Outlook – Weyerhaeuser anticipates first quarter earnings and Adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the fourth quarter, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board. The company expects modestly higher sales volumes for oriented strand board, partially offset by moderately higher fiber costs. For lumber, the company expects moderately higher log costs and slightly lower sales volumes, partially offset by improved unit manufacturing costs. Engineered wood products sales volumes are expected to be higher with comparable sales realizations. 

UNALLOCATED 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Q4 2021 Performance – Fourth quarter results include an adjustment to our self-insurance accruals, primarily due to elevated medical claims activity.  

Fourth quarter special items include a $15 million pretax noncash legal benefit.
