Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On April 15, 2021, we extended our $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility from January 2023 (as fully extended) to April 2026 (as fully extended). The interest rate on the extended facility was lowered to LIBOR plus 0.90% from LIBOR plus 1.00%. We subsequently qualified for a sustainability margin adjustment by achieving certain key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, which reduced our interest rate by 0.01% to LIBOR plus 0.89%. The facility fee remains at 20 basis points. Our separate $1.50 billion unsecured revolving credit facility matures in March 2024 (as fully extended) and has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.90% and a facility fee of 20 basis points.

555 California Street

On May 10, 2021, we completed a $1.2 billion refinancing of 555 California Street, a three-building 1.8 million square foot office campus in San Francisco, in which we own a 70.0% controlling interest.

We swapped the interest rate on our $840,000,000 share of the loan to a fixed rate of 2.26% through May 2024. The loan replaced the previous $533,000,000 loan that bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.10% and was scheduled to mature in September 2021.

Senior Unsecured Notes

On May 24, 2021, we completed a green bond public offering of $400,000,000 2.15% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2026 ("2026 Notes") and $350,000,000 3.40% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2031 ("2031 Notes"). Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1, commencing December 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes were sold at 99.86% of their face amount to yield 2.18% and the 2031 Notes were sold at 99.59% of their face amount to yield 3.45%.

theMART

On May 28, 2021, we repaid the $675,000,000 mortgage loan on theMART, a 3.7 million square foot commercial building in Chicago, with proceeds from our senior unsecured notes offering. The loan bore interest at 2.70% and was scheduled to mature in September 2021.

Preferred Securities

On September 22, 2021, Vornado sold 12,000,000 4.45% Series O cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share, pursuant to an effective registration statement. Vornado received aggregate net proceeds of $291,153,000, after underwriters' discount and issuance costs, and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 12,000,000 4.45% Series O preferred units (with economic terms that mirror those of the Series O preferred shares). Dividends on the Series O preferred shares/units are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears. The Series O preferred shares/units are not convertible into, or exchangeable for, any of our properties or securities. On or after five years from the date of issuance (or sooner under limited circumstances), Vornado may redeem the Series O preferred shares/units at a redemption price of $25.00 per share/unit, plus accrued and unpaid dividends/distributions through the date of redemption. The Series O preferred shares/units have no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by Vornado. Vornado used the net proceeds for the redemption of its 5.70% Series K cumulative redeemable preferred shares/units. 

On October 13, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding 5.70% Series K preferred shares/units at their redemption price of $25.00 per share/unit, or $300,000,000 in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid dividends/distributions through the date of redemption. We recognized $9,033,000 of previously capitalized issuance costs in "Series K preferred share/unit issuance costs" on our consolidated statements of income during the third quarter of 2021, when the preferred shares/units were called for redemption.

1290 Avenue of the Americas

On November 16, 2021, we completed a $950,000,000 refinancing of 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2.1 million square foot Class A Manhattan office building, in which we own a 70.0% controlling interest. The interest-only loan bears a rate of LIBOR plus 1.51% (1.62% as of December 31, 2021) in years one to five, increasing 0.25% in both years six and seven. The loan matures in November 2023 with five one-year extension options (November 2028 as fully extended). We defeased the existing $950,000,000 loan that bore interest at a fixed rate of 3.34% and was scheduled to mature in November 2022. As a result, we incurred $23,729,000 of defeasance costs, which are included in "interest and debt expense" on our consolidated statements of income, of which $7,119,000 is attributable to noncontrolling interest.

Currently, one of the most significant factors is the ongoing adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, operating performance and the effect it has had and may continue to have on our tenants, the global, national, regional and local economies and financial markets and the real estate market in general. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, including vaccination rates among the population, the efficacy and durability of vaccines against emerging variants, and governmental and tenant responses thereto, all of which are uncertain at this time but the impact could be material. Moreover, you are cautioned that the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten many of the risks identified in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

OPERATING RESULTS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of certain real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because they exclude the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, we also disclose FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance. Reconciliations of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions are provided on the following page. Reconciliations of FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted are provided on page 3 of this press release.

NOI at share represents total revenues less operating expenses including our share of partially owned entities. NOI at share - cash basis represents NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments. We consider NOI at share - cash basis to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI at share - cash basis, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. NOI at share - cash basis includes rent that has been deferred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
