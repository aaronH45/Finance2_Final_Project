Fourth Quarter 2021 Operating Results

Sales of $5.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 3 percent versus the prior year. Organic sales increased 3 percent as net selling prices rose 2 percent and product mix increased sales 1 percent. In North America, organic sales were even with year-ago in consumer products and increased 2 percent in K-C

Professional. Outside North America, organic sales rose 8 percent in developing and emerging (D&E) markets and 2 percent in developed markets.

Fourth quarter operating profit was $521 million in 2021 and $749 million in 2020. Results in both periods include charges related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program. Results in 2020 also include Softex Indonesia acquisition-related costs and a benefit from the resolution of a business tax matter in Brazil. 

Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit was $611 million in 2021 and $767 million in 2020. Results were impacted by $530 million of higher input costs, driven by pulp and polymer-based materials, distribution and energy costs.  Results benefited from organic sales growth, $115 million of cost savings from the company’s FORCE (Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere) program, $35 million of cost savings from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program, lower other manufacturing costs and reduced marketing, research and general expense. Foreign currency transaction effects also positively impacted the comparison. 

The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 20.9 percent in 2021 and 24.6 percent in 2020. The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.9 percent in 2021 and 22.2 percent in 2020. Kimberly-Clark’s share of net income of equity companies in the fourth quarter was $10 million in 2021 and $38 million in 2020. Results were negatively impacted by input cost inflation and 2018 Global Restructuring Program charges.

Cash Flow and Balance Sheet

Cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter was $1,062 million in 2021 and $887 million in 2020. Full-year cash provided by operations was $2,730 million in 2021 compared to a record $3,729 million in 2020. The full-year comparison was impacted by lower earnings and less cash provided by working capital. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $273 million in 2021 and $323 million in 2020. Full-year spending was $1,007 in 2021 and $1,217 in 2020. 

Fourth quarter 2021 share repurchases were 0.1 million shares at a cost of $7 million, bringing full-year repurchases to 3.0 million shares at a cost of $400 million. Total debt was $8.6 billion at the end of 2021 and $8.4 billion at the end of 2020.

The volume comparison reflects elevated shipments in North America in the year-ago period to support higher consumer and customer demand related to COVID-19.

Results benefited from cost savings and reduced marketing, research and general spending.

Full Year 2021 Results

Sales of $19.4 billion increased 2 percent. Organic sales decreased 1 percent as volumes declined 4 percent while net selling prices increased 2 percent and product mix improved 1 percent. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 1 percent and the net impact of the Softex Indonesia acquisition and business exits in conjunction with the 2018 Global Restructuring Program increased sales approximately 1 percent. 

Operating profit was $2,561 million in 2021 and $3,244 million in 2020. Results in both periods include charges related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program. Results in 2020 also included Softex Indonesia acquisition-related costs and a benefit from the resolution of a business tax matter in Brazil. 

Adjusted operating profit was $2,836 million in 2021 and $3,582 million in 2020. Results were impacted by lower sales volumes, $1,490 million of higher input costs and elevated other manufacturing costs. Results benefited from higher net selling prices, $410 million of FORCE savings, $140 million of cost savings from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program and reduced marketing, research and general spending. 

Diluted net income per share was $5.35 in 2021 and $6.87 in 2020. Adjusted earnings per share of $6.18 decreased 20 percent compared to $7.74 in 2020. The decrease was driven by lower adjusted operating profit and lower net income from equity companies, partially offset by a lower share count and a lower adjusted effective tax rate.

2018 Global Restructuring Program

In January 2018, Kimberly-Clark initiated the 2018 Global Restructuring Program to reduce the company’s structural cost base and enhance the company’s flexibility to invest in its brands, growth initiatives and capabilities critical to delivering future growth. As part of the program, Kimberly-Clark exited or divested some low-margin businesses that represented about 1 percent of company net sales and sold or closed 11 facilities.

Charges for the restructuring program were completed at the end of 2021. Total cumulative costs were $2,175 million pre-tax ($1,635 million after tax) compared to the previous estimate for charges of $2,100 to $2,200 million pre-tax ($1,580 to $1,650 million after tax). The program generated annual pre-tax cost savings of $560 million, at the high end of the previous savings range. 

2022 Outlook and Key Planning Assumptions

The company’s 2022 outlook assumes no significant additional impact from potential supply chain disruptions as a result of COVID-19. In addition, key planning and guidance assumptions are as follows:

•Net sales increase 1 to 2 percent.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This news release and the accompanying tables include the following financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures:

•Adjusted earnings and earnings per share

•Adjusted gross and operating profit

•Adjusted effective tax rate

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures:

•2018 Global Restructuring Program. Mentioned elsewhere in this release.

•Softex Indonesia acquisition-related costs. The company incurred costs to evaluate and execute the acquisition of Softex Indonesia in 2020.

•Brazil business tax credits. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we received a favorable legal ruling that resolved certain matters related to prior years’ business taxes in Brazil.

The company provides these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures. Management and the company's Board of Directors use adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted gross and operating profit to (a) evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance and its performance relative to its competitors, (b) allocate resources and (c) measure the operational 

-6-

performance of the company's business units and their managers. Management also believes that the use of an adjusted effective tax rate provides improved insight into the tax effects of our ongoing business operations.

Additionally, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the company's Board of Directors has used certain of the non-GAAP financial measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals. These goals are based, in part, on the company's adjusted earnings per share and improvement in the company's adjusted return on invested capital determined by excluding certain of the adjustments that are used in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures.

This news release includes information regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, net selling prices and product mix on net sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and exited businesses also impact the year-over-year change in net sales.

As more fully described in Kimberly-Clark’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the company continues to actively address the COVID-19 situation and its impact globally. The impact of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread are affecting our business in a number of ways. We have experienced increased volatility in demand for some of our products as consumers adapt to the evolving environment. We have also experienced incidents of supply chain disruption and increased currency and commodity volatility. We expect the ultimate significance of the impact on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such circumstances continue, which will depend on the currently unknowable extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental and public actions taken in response. COVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future business performance, particularly over the near term.

Certain matters contained in this news release concerning the outlook, anticipated financial and operating results, raw material, energy and other input costs, anticipated currency rates and exchange risks, including in Argentina, net income from equity companies, sources and uses of cash, the effective tax rate, the anticipated cost savings from the company’s FORCE program, growth initiatives, product innovations, contingencies and

anticipated transactions of the company constitute forward-looking statements and are based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company. In addition, many factors outside our control, including pandemics (including the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and the related responses of governments, consumers, customers, suppliers and employees), epidemics, the prices and availability of our raw materials, supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19, changes in customer preferences, severe weather conditions or government trade or similar regulatory actions, potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products, energy costs, failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies from the Softex Indonesia acquisition, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to maintain key customer relationships, as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business, could affect the realization of these estimates.

There can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that the company's results will be as estimated. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them. For a description of certain factors that could cause the company's future results to differ from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements, see Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
