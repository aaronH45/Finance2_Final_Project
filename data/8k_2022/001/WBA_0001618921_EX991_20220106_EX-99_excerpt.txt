DEERFIELD, Ill., January 6, 2022 - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (Nasdaq: WBA) today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, which ended November 30, 2021.  

Chief Executive Officer Rosalind Brewer said:  

“First quarter results exceeded our expectations, with a very encouraging performance across all our business segments. I am particularly excited about the progress we’re making in building out Walgreens Health. Our majority investments in VillageMD and Shields closed during the quarter, and we’re rolling out VillageMD primary care co-locations and Walgreens Health Corners at pace. The strong start to the fiscal year reinforces our confidence in the future, and as a result, we are raising our guidance for the full year and increasing investments in our people. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for sustainable, long-term value creation.”   

Overview of First Quarter Results  

WBA first quarter sales from continuing operations increased 7.8 percent from the year-ago quarter to $33.9 billion, an increase of 7.6 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong comparable sales growth at Walgreens and in the International segment.  

Operating income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion in the first quarter compared to an operating loss of $535 million in the year-ago quarter. This was partly driven by a $1.5 billion charge from the company’s equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen in the year ago quarter. Adjusted operating income from continuing operations was $1.8 billion, an increase of 48.5 percent on a constant currency basis. The increases reflect strong adjusted gross profit growth across both pharmacy and retail in the United States and a continued rebound in International segment sales and profitability.  

Net earnings from continuing operations were $3.6 billion in the first quarter compared to a loss of $391 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting a $2.5 billion after-tax gain due to the valuation of the company’s previously held minority equity and debt investments in VillageMD and Shields in the three months ended November 30, 2021, and a $1.2 billion charge, net of tax, from the company’s equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen in the year ago quarter. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $1.5 billion, up 53.5 percent on a reported and constant currency basis compared with the year-ago quarter.  

EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter was $4.13, compared with a loss of $0.45 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.68, an increase of 53.2 percent on a reported basis and an increase of 53.1 percent on a constant currency basis.  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion in the first quarter and free cash flow was $645 million, a $118 million decrease compared with the year-ago quarter primarily driven by phasing of working capital, COVID-19 related government support in the year-ago quarter and increased capital expenditures.

Business Segments  

United States:  

The United States segment had first quarter sales of $28.0 billion, an increase of 3.2 percent from the year-ago quarter, held back by a decline in the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime business. Comparable sales increased 7.9 percent from the year-ago quarter.  

Pharmacy sales increased 1.1 percent. Excluding the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime business, sales grew 5.8 percent in the quarter. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 6.8 percent in the quarter compared to a year-ago, with prescriptions filled increasing by 6.2 percent, including a positive impact of approximately 535 basis points from COVID-19 vaccinations.  

Retail sales increased 10.1 percent and comparable retail sales increased 10.6 percent in the first quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. Excluding tobacco and e-cigarettes, comparable retail sales increased 11.7 percent, reflecting broad based growth across all categories. In particular, health and wellness increased 24.7 percent aided by at-home COVID-19 tests and cough cold flu, and beauty and personal care increased 16.6 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively.  

Gross profit increased 12.6 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Adjusted gross profit increased 12.3 percent driven by strong sales growth, partially offset by reimbursement.  

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 6.7 percent compared with the year ago quarter. Adjusted SG&A increased 4.2 percent, driven by investments to support COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, and labor investments, partially offset by savings from the Transformational Cost Management program and timing benefits.  

Operating income in the first quarter increased to $1.4 billion compared to a net operating loss of $504 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 46.3 percent, to $1.7 billion.  

International:  

The International segment had first quarter sales of $5.8 billion, an increase of 35.8 percent from the year-ago quarter, including a favorable currency impact of 1.6 percent. Sales increased 34.2 percent on a constant currency basis, including higher sales associated with the formation of company’s wholesale joint venture in Germany. Excluding this benefit, International segment sales on a constant currency basis increased 8.6 percent, reflecting the ongoing recovery in the UK market, following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in July.  

Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales increased 8.8 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger demand for pharmacy services. Boots UK comparable retail sales increased 16.3 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Footfall improved but traffic still remains below pre-COVID-19 levels. Boots.com continued to perform well, with digital sales in the first quarter almost doubling compared with the equivalent quarter pre-COVID-19.  

Gross profit increased 21.9 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago, including a favorable currency impact of 3.7 percent. Adjusted gross profit increased 18.2 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong UK growth, and higher gross profit associated with inclusion of a full quarter of results from the company’s wholesale joint venture in Germany, partly offset by favorable timing of NHS reimbursement in the year-ago quarter.  

3   

SG&A in the quarter increased 21.1 percent from the year-ago quarter to $1.2 billion, including an adverse currency impact of 4.0 percent. Adjusted SG&A increased 11.4 percent on a constant currency basis. The increase in both SG&A and adjusted SG&A reflects higher costs associated with the company’s wholesale joint venture in Germany, and COVID-19 related government support in the year-ago quarter.  

Operating income grew 39.8 percent, including an adverse currency impact of 3.8 percent, to $54 million. Adjusted operating income grew strongly to $164 million, an increase of 88.6 percent on a constant currency basis, compared with the year-ago quarter.  

Walgreens Health:  

In conjunction with the launch of its new consumer-centric healthcare strategy, in fiscal 2022, the company announced the creation of a new operating segment, Walgreens Health. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2022, the company is now aligned into three reportable segments: United States, International and Walgreens Health.  

The company’s Walgreens Health segment is a consumer-centric, technology-enabled healthcare business that engages consumers through a personalized, omni-channel experience across the care journey. Walgreens Health delivers improved health outcomes and lower costs for payors and providers by delivering care through owned and partnered assets.  

The Walgreens Health segment currently consists of:  

   •    

A majority position in VillageMD, a leading, national provider of value-based primary care services;  

   •    

A majority position in Shields, a specialty pharmacy integrator and accelerator for hospitals; and  

   •    

The Walgreens Health organically-developed business that contracts with payors and providers to deliver clinical healthcare services to their members and members’ caregivers through both digital and physical channels.  

The Walgreens Health segment had first quarter sales of $51 million resulting from the acquisition of Shields on October 29 and VillageMD on November 24.  

Gross profit was $20 million and adjusted gross profit was $20 million, both reflecting results from Shields and VillageMD. First quarter SG&A was $65 million, and adjusted SG&A was $33 million reflecting the two acquisitions and acceleration of investments in Walgreens Health. Operating loss was $45 million. Adjusted operating loss was $13 million.

WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)  

REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(in millions, except per share amounts)  

The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  

These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the company’s business from period to period and trends in the company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release.  

The company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.  

Constant currency  

The company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the United States reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and this presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  

Comparable sales  

For the company’s United States and International segments, comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least 12 consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster in the past 12 months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first 12 months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first 12 months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. Comparable retail sales for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, the company’s method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.  

With respect to the International segment, comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales, are presented on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the discussion above in “Constant currency” for further details on constant currency calculations.  

10   

Key Performance Indicators  

The company considers certain metrics, including all comparable metrics, number of prescriptions, number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions and number of locations at period end, to be key performance indicators because the company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.

NET EARNINGS (LOSS) AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

12   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

13   

 1   

Transformational Cost Management Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity.  

 2   

Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and inventory valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangibles assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of the inventory reflects cost of acquired inventory and a portion of the expected profit margin. The acquisition-related inventory valuation adjustments excludes the expected profit margin component from cost of sales recorded under the business combination accounting principles.  

 3   

Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities. These costs include all charges incurred on certain mergers, acquisition and divestitures related activities, for example, including costs related to integration efforts for successful merger, acquisition and divestitures activities. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance and stock compensation. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company’s current operating performance.  

 4   

Adjustments to equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen consist of the Company’s proportionate share of non-GAAP adjustments reported by AmerisourceBergen consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP measures. The Company recognized equity losses in AmerisourceBergen of $1,373 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020. These equity losses are primarily due to AmerisourceBergen’s recognition of $5.6 billion, net of tax, charges related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months period ended September 30, 2020.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 6   

Gain or loss on certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within other income (loss). We do not believe this volatility related to mark-to-market adjustment on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Company’s operational performance.  

 7   

Includes significant gains on business combinations due to the remeasurement of previously held minority equity interests and debt securities to fair value. During the three months ended November 30, 2021, the Company recorded such pretax gains of $2,174 million and $402 million for VillageMD and Shields respectively.  

 8   

Adjustments to income tax provision (benefit) include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax provision (benefit) commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. tax law changes and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded within income tax provision (benefit).  

 9   

Adjustments to post tax (loss) earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees’ non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded within post tax (loss) earnings from other equity method investments. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees.  

 10   

Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the quarterly calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the three months ended November 30, 2020.  

 11  

Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the quarterly calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes for the three months ended November 30, 2020.

Operating income (loss) for United States includes equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen. As a result of the two-month reporting lag, operating income (loss) for the three month period ended November 30, 2021 includes AmerisourceBergen equity earnings (loss) for the period of July 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021. Operating income (loss) for the three month period ended November 30, 2020 includes AmerisourceBergen equity earnings (loss) for the period of July 1, 2020 through September 31, 2020.  

 2   

Operating margins and adjusted operating margins have been calculated excluding equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen and adjusted equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen, respectively.

Operating income (loss) for United States includes equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen. As a result of the two-month reporting lag, operating income (loss) for the three month period ended November 30, 2021 includes AmerisourceBergen equity earnings (loss) for the period of July 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021.

FREE CASH FLOW  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1   

Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities in a period less additions to property, plant and equipment (capital expenditures) made in that period. This measure does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures as the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments for future business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statements of cash flows.
