CITIGROUP INC.

Current Report on Form 8-K

Item 8.01 Other Events.

As part of its previously disclosed strategic review, on January 11, 2022, Citigroup Inc. (Citi) announced that it intends to exit the consumer, small business and middle market banking operations of Citibanamex, which would advance Citi’s strategic goals to invest in businesses aligned with Citi’s core strengths, simplify its operations and drive long-term shareholder value. The businesses in the intended exit include the Mexico consumer and small business banking operations, reported as part of Citi’s Global Consumer Banking segment, as well as the Mexico middle market banking business, reported in Citi’s Institutional Clients Group segment. The Mexico consumer and small business banking operations included in the intended exit represent the entirety of the Latin America Global Consumer Banking unit. Citi will continue to operate a locally-licensed banking business in Mexico through its global Institutional Clients Group, which remains important to Citi’s global network.

The method and timing of Citi’s exit from its consumer, small business and middle market banking operations in Mexico, which could include a sale or a public market alternative, will be determined by Citi and will be aligned with its objectives of maximizing shareholder value and strengthening both the businesses that Citi will exit and those it will retain. The exit process is subject to various conditions and approvals, including applicable regulatory approvals in both the U.S. and Mexico.

Certain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of future results or occurrences. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors. These factors include, among others, consummation of the intended exit, such as satisfying various conditions and approvals, macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties and local banking conditions; the incurrence of unexpected charges or expenses; the impact of the accounting for currency translation adjustments related to the affected businesses; and the precautionary statements included in this current report. These factors also consist of those contained in Citi’s filings with the SEC, including without limitation the “Risk Factors” section of Citi’s 2020 Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Citi speak only as to the date they are made, and Citi does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements were made.
