  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1       

Tire unit volumes totaled 48.6 million, up 29% from the prior year’s period. Replacement tire unit volume increased 39%, reflecting the addition of Cooper Tire unit volume and market share gains. Original equipment unit volume decreased 1%, reflecting lower vehicle production, which continued to be affected by shortages of components and materials, partially offset by market share gains in the legacy Goodyear business.  

Goodyear’s fourth quarter 2021 net income was $553 million ($1.93 per share) compared to net income of $63 million (27 cents per share) a year ago. There were several significant items in the period, including a non-cash net benefit of $379 million related to discrete income tax items, driven by a $325 million reduction in valuation allowances on certain U.S. deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits. The reduced valuation allowance reflected the benefit of Cooper Tire U.S. income and synergies, as well as tax planning actions.  

Other significant items included, on a pre-tax basis, a gain of $20 million related to a tariff-rate change, an insurance recovery of $10 million, net gains of $10 million associated with asset sales, pension settlement charges of $13 million and rationalization charges of $12 million.  

Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted net income was $162 million (57 cents per share) compared to adjusted net income of $103 million (44 cents per share) in the prior year’s quarter. Per share amounts are diluted.  

The company reported segment operating income of $391 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, up $89 million from a year ago. The company also reported merger-adjusted segment operating income of $398 million, which excludes incremental amortization of Cooper Tire intangible assets. The increase in segment operating income primarily reflects improvements in price/mix, the Cooper Tire merger and impacts of higher volume, including increased factory utilization. These factors were partially offset by higher raw material costs, inflationary cost pressures in wages, benefits, transportation and energy, and increased U.S. manufacturing costs related to higher employee turnover. The reported results include Cooper Tire operating income of $149 million, which includes $7 million of incremental amortization of Cooper Tire intangible assets.  

Full-Year Results  

Goodyear’s 2021 net sales were $17.5 billion, a 42% increase from the 2020 period, primarily due to the Cooper Tire merger, higher volume, improvements in price/mix and increased sales from other tire-related businesses.  

Tire unit volumes totaled 169.3 million, up 34% from 2020. Replacement tire shipments increased 41%. This growth included additional tire unit volume related to the Cooper Tire merger, which closed on June 7, 2021, the benefit of stronger industry demand and improved market share. Original equipment volume increased 13%, driven by higher global vehicle production in the second quarter and market share gains.  

Goodyear’s 2021 net income was $764 million ($2.89 per share) compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion ($5.35 per share) in the prior year’s period. The period included several significant items. Among these were a non-cash net benefit of $409 million related to discrete income tax adjustments, driven by a $325 million reduction in valuation allowances on certain U.S. deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits. Other significant items included, on a pre-tax basis, a $114 million benefit related to a Brazilian Supreme Court ruling with respect to indirect taxes, a gain of $20 million related to a tariff-rate change, net gains of $20 million associated with asset sales, an insurance recovery of $10 million, amortization of Cooper Tire inventory step-up adjustments of $110 million and transaction and other costs of $56 million (both in connection with the Cooper Tire merger), rationalization charges of $93 million, an estimated negative impact of $54 million related to a severe winter storm in the U.S., and pension settlement charges of $43 million.

Goodyear’s 2020 net income included a non-cash charge of $295 million related to a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and, on a pre-tax basis, a non-cash impairment charge of $182 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the Europe, Middle East and Africa business, a non-cash asset impairment charge of $148 million to reduce the carrying value of an equity interest in TireHub, and rationalization charges of $159 million, primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in Gadsden, Alabama.  

Full-year 2021 adjusted net income was $553 million ($2.09 per share), compared to an adjusted net loss of $448 million ($1.91 per share) in 2020. Per share amounts are diluted.  

The company reported segment operating income of $1.3 billion in 2021, up $1.3 billion from a year ago. The company also reported merger-adjusted segment operating income of $1.4 billion, which excludes certain costs triggered by the Cooper Tire merger. The increase in segment operating income primarily reflects improvements in price/mix, the impacts of higher volume, including increased factory utilization, the Cooper Tire merger, higher earnings from other tire-related businesses, and the benefits of cost saving actions. These factors were partially offset by higher raw material costs, the nonrecurrence of benefits related to temporary cost reductions during last year’s pandemic shutdown, inflationary cost pressures in wages, benefits, transportation and energy, and increased U.S. manufacturing costs related to higher employee turnover. Segment operating income also benefited from $69 million related to a Brazilian Supreme Court ruling with respect to indirect taxes. This benefit was partly offset by the adverse effects of a severe winter storm in the U.S., which are estimated at $42 million. The reported results include Cooper Tire operating income of $181 million, which includes $110 million of amortization of Cooper Tire inventory step-up adjustments, $18 million incremental amortization of Cooper Tire intangible assets and $6 million of other transaction-related items.

Business Segment Results  

Americas  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Americas’ fourth quarter 2021 sales of $3.0 billion were 58% higher than in 2020, driven by the Cooper Tire merger, improvements in price/mix, and increased sales from other tire-related businesses. Tire unit volume increased 45%. Replacement tire unit volume increased 58%. Excluding the impact of Cooper Tire, U.S. consumer replacement volume increased 3%. Original equipment unit volume decreased 6%, reflecting lower vehicle production, which continued to be affected by shortages of components and materials, partially offset by market share gains in the legacy Goodyear business.

Fourth quarter 2021 segment operating income of $308 million was up $118 million from the prior year’s quarter. The increase was driven by improvements in price/mix and the Cooper Tire merger. These factors were partially offset by higher raw material costs, inflationary cost pressures in wages, benefits, transportation and energy, and temporary labor inefficiencies in the U.S. given increased staffing and training. The reported results include Cooper Tire operating income of $135 million, which includes incremental amortization of Cooper Tire intangible assets of $7 million.  

Europe, Middle East and Africa  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Europe, Middle East and Africa’s fourth quarter 2021 sales increased 16% from last year to $1.4 billion, primarily due to improvements in price/mix and the Cooper Tire merger. Tire unit volume increased 11%. Replacement tire unit volume rose 24%. Excluding the impact of the Cooper Tire merger, European consumer replacement volume increased 22%, driven by market share gains. Original equipment unit volume decreased 22%, reflecting lower vehicle production, which continued to be affected by shortages of components and materials, partially offset by market share gains.  

Fourth quarter 2021 segment operating income of $41 million was down $28 million from the prior year’s quarter, driven by higher raw material costs and inflationary cost pressures in wages, benefits, transportation and energy. These factors were partially offset by improvements in price/mix and the impact of higher volume, including increased factory utilization.  

Asia Pacific  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Asia Pacific’s fourth quarter 2021 sales increased 17% to $628 million, driven by the Cooper Tire merger, improvements in price/mix, and higher volume. Tire unit volume increased 20%, driven by the addition of Cooper Tire’s units. Replacement tire unit volume increased 12%. Original equipment unit volume increased 36%.  

Fourth quarter 2021 segment operating income of $42 million was down $1 million from the prior year’s quarter,  

driven by higher raw material and other costs, mostly offset by improvements in price/mix, the Cooper Tire merger and higher volume.

Cooper Tire  

On June 7, Goodyear completed its announced Cooper Tire transaction. The company’s fourth quarter and full-year results incorporate the operating results of Cooper Tire since June 7. Cooper Tire sales during these periods totaled $963 million and $2.1 billion, respectively. Inventory and other assets of Cooper Tire were recorded based on their fair value on June 7 and the cost of goods sold of tires sold after that date in the second and third quarters reflect the “step-up” to fair value. Merger-adjusted segment operating income excludes the impact of this “step-up” and certain other costs triggered by the combination, which totaled $134 million for 2021, including $7 million in the fourth quarter.  

The company continues to expect substantial financial benefits from the merger, including $250 million of run-rate synergies by mid-2023, excluding one-time transaction costs and accounting adjustments. The majority of the cost synergies will be related to manufacturing efficiencies, revenue growth opportunities, and developing efficient combined support organizations. Approximately $29 million of these run-rate benefits have been attained as of Dec. 31, 2021. In addition, the combination is expected to generate net present value of $450 million or more by utilizing Goodyear’s available U.S. tax attributes. These tax attributes are expected to reduce the company’s cash tax payments, positioning it to generate additional free cash flow.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (unaudited)  

This earnings release presents Total Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Margin, Merger-Adjusted Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (EPS), which are important financial measures for the company but are not financial measures defined by U.S. GAAP, and should not be construed as alternatives to corresponding financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  

Total Segment Operating Income (Loss) is the sum of the individual strategic business units’ (SBUs’) Segment Operating Income (Loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Total Segment Operating Margin is Total Segment Operating Income (Loss) divided by Net Sales as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that Total Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Margin are useful because they represent the aggregate value of income created by the company’s SBUs and exclude items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to Total Segment Operating Income (Loss) is Goodyear Net Income (Loss) and to Total Segment Operating Margin is Return on Sales (which is calculated by dividing Goodyear Net Income (Loss) by Net Sales).  

Merger-Adjusted Segment Operating Income (Loss) is Total Segment Operating Income (Loss) less the impact of the amortization of inventory step-up adjustments, the incremental amortization of intangible assets and other transaction-related items related to the Cooper Tire merger. Merger-Adjusted Segment Operating Margin is Merger-Adjusted Segment Operating Income (Loss) divided by Net Sales as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that Merger-Adjusted Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Margin are useful because they allow investors to understand and evaluate the aggregate value of income created by the company’s SBUs in a manner that is more comparable to the performance of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and Cooper Tire & Rubber Company in the periods before the merger by adjusting for certain expenses related to the Cooper Tire merger, including amortization of the Cooper Tire inventory step-up adjustments, incremental amortization of Cooper Tire intangible assets and other transaction-related items.  

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is Goodyear Net Income (Loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP adjusted for certain significant items. Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share is the company’s Adjusted Net Income (Loss) divided by Weighted Average Shares Outstanding-Diluted as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share are useful because they represent how management reviews the operating results of the company excluding the impacts of non-cash impairment charges, rationalizations, asset write-offs, accelerated depreciation, asset sales and certain other significant items.  

It should be noted that other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently and, as a result, the measures presented herein may not be comparable to such similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  

See the tables below for reconciliations of historical Total Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Margin, Merger-Adjusted Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.
