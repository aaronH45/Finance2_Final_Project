This information shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Item 5.02Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On January 28, 2022, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company increased the size of the Board from 11 to 12 directors, and appointed Mark D. Morelli as a member of the Board to fill the vacancy, effective February 3, 2022. The Board expects to determine committee assignments for Mr. Morelli at a subsequent meeting. The Board has determined that Mr. Morelli is independent under the Company’s Corporate Governance Principles, the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and regulations.

Mr. Morelli currently serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of Vontier Corporation. There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Morelli and any other person pursuant to which he was elected as a director.

Mr. Morelli will receive compensation consistent with the standard compensatory arrangements for non-employee directors of the Board, as described under the heading “Director Compensation” in the Company's 2021 Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on March 30, 2021. Mr. Morelli's compensation for the current term will be prorated.
