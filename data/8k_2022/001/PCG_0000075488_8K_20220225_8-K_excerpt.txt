 Item 8.01 Other Events 

On February 25, 2022, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the “Utility”), a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, submitted supplemental testimony (the “Supplemental Testimony”) for its 2023 General Rate Case (“GRC”) application to reflect the Utility’s integrated wildfire mitigation strategy, including the Utility’s proposals for the initial phase of undergrounding 10,000 miles of electric distribution powerlines in high fire risk areas throughout the Utility’s service area, the Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings (“EPSS”) program, and its vegetation management program. The Supplemental Testimony amends the revenue requirement request in the Utility’s original 2023 GRC application, which was filed on June 30, 2021 (the “Original Application”). 

 The Utility’s updated revenue requirement request for the 2023 test year reduced its prior request from $15.46 billion to $15.34 billion. The following table compares the requested revenue requirement increase in the Supplemental Testimony with the requested revenue requirement increase in Original Application for the period of 2023 to 2026: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 In the Supplemental Testimony, the Utility requested that the CPUC approve an additional $6.93 billion in undergrounding capital expenditures over the period of 2023 to 2026. The Supplemental Testimony also included a request for $572 million in expense over the period of 2023 to 2026 for the EPSS program, which was not included in the Original Application. Additionally, the Supplemental Testimony reduced the Original Application’s request for vegetation management program expenses by approximately $1.0 billion over the period of 2023 to 2026. The revised revenue requirement sought in the Supplemental Testimony excludes certain recorded costs for wildfire mitigation and gas safety work that the Utility intends to seek in a second track of this proceeding.  

 The following table compares the requested weighted-average rate base in the Supplemental Testimony with the requested weighted-average rate base in Original Application for the period of 2023 to 2026:
