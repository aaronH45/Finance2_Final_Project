ITEM 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On February 22, 2022, the Compensation, People and Culture Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the following actions relative to salary and performance-based awards for the Company’s Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and the Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”) set forth in the Company’s proxy statement dated April 8, 2021 (collectively the “Executives”):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Nordstrom follows a pay-for-performance philosophy. The Company’s compensation plans are designed to encourage executives to focus on goals that align with business strategy, operating performance and shareholder values. In support of our philosophy, performance-based awards pay out only when pre-determined results are achieved. The 2021 cash bonuses were determined based on the achievement of pre-established performance measures set by the Committee under the shareholder-approved Nordstrom, Inc. Executive Management Bonus Plan.

2 Base salary amounts disclosed represent an increase of $30,000 for Anne Bramman, effective March 27, 2022. Base salary amounts for Erik Nordstrom, Peter Nordstrom, Kenneth Worzel and Edmond Mesrobian are unchanged from base salary amounts in 2021. 

Also on February 22, 2022, the Company certified the attainment of the pre-established performance goals for the 2019 Performance Share Unit (“PSU”) grant relating to the fiscal years 2019 through 2021. The Company’s performance did not meet the minimum threshold for a payout. Accordingly, the 2019 PSUs did not vest and were cancelled without payment to the Executives.

On that same date, the Committee determined to award stock option grants to the Executives, to be effective March 3, 2022, the first open window trading date after Committee approval. Stock options were granted pursuant to the terms of the Nordstrom, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”) and have a term of ten years with an exercise price equivalent to the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on March 3, 2022. Vesting occurs at a rate of 50% in year three, and 50% in year four, in each case on the tenth day of the month immediately following the date of grant. The number of options to be awarded to each individual is a function of base pay, an option long-term incentive (“LTI”) percentage and the fair value of an option. The Binomial Lattice model is used to estimate the fair value of an option. This model requires the input of certain assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life. The formula for determining the number of options granted is:

No. of Options = (base pay x option LTI%) / option fair value

This summary of the key terms of the foregoing nonqualified stock option grants is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the 2020 Nonqualified Stock Option Award Agreement, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed March 3, 2020 and is incorporated by reference. The number of options actually granted to the Executives, once determined, will be reported in an amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

On that same date, the Committee also determined to award PSUs to the Executives pursuant to the terms of the Equity Plan. The PSU awards are effective March 3, 2022. PSUs may only be settled in shares of Company Common Stock upon the achievement of such performance goals as may be established by the Committee at the time of grant based on any one or a combination of certain performance criteria enumerated in the Equity Plan. The 2022 PSUs may be earned over a three-year period from fiscal year 2022 though fiscal year 2024. The percentage of PSUs granted that will actually be earned at the end of the three-year period is based upon the Company’s cumulative sales and earnings before interest and tax (“EBIT”) margin results over the same period. The minimum 

percentage of PSUs that can be earned at the end of the three-year performance cycle is 75% and the maximum is 150%. The number of PSUs to be awarded to each individual is a function of base pay, a PSU LTI percentage and the fair value of a PSU. The fair value of a PSU is calculated as the stock price as of the effective date less the present value of Company stock dividends over the vesting period. This calculation requires the input of certain assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate and the expected Company stock dividends. The formula for determining the number of PSUs granted is:

No. of PSUs = (base pay x PSU LTI%) / PSU fair value

The foregoing summary of the key terms of the PSU awards is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the 2022 Performance Share Unit Award Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated by reference. The number of PSUs actually granted to each of the Executives, once determined, will be reported in an amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
