McKinney, TX, February 2, 2022—Globe Life Inc. (NYSE: GL) reported today that for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, net income was $1.76 per diluted common share, compared with $1.93 per diluted common share for the year-ago quarter. Net operating income for the quarter was $1.70 per diluted common share, compared with $1.74 per diluted common share for the year-ago quarter. 

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $7.22 per diluted common share, compared with $6.82 per diluted common share for the year-ago period. Net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $6.86 per diluted common share compared with $6.88 per diluted common share for the year-ago period.

HIGHLIGHTS:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COVID-19 Update: In the fourth quarter, the Company incurred approximately $58 million of COVID life claims, resulting in total COVID life claims of $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Fourth quarter COVID life claims incurred were $23 million higher than projected primarily due to higher deaths, likely related to the Delta variant. Going forward, we anticipate that COVID deaths will continue at elevated levels throughout 2022, with an estimated impact of approximately $50 million at the mid-point of our guidance and based on a range of $3 million to $4 million per 10,000 U.S. deaths.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net operating income, a non-GAAP(1) financial measure, has been used consistently by Globe Life’s management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized investment gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income. Management believes an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company’s business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

The following table represents Globe Life's operating summary for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:

MANAGEMENT VS. GAAP MEASURES

Shareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, and book value per share, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, are non-GAAP measures that are utilized by management to view the business without the effect of unrealized gains or losses which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates associated with the available-for-sale portfolio. Management views the business in this manner because the Company does not intend to sell, nor is it likely that management will be required to sell, the fixed maturities prior to their maturity. It creates more meaningful trends than can be more easily identified without the fluctuations. Shareholders' equity and book value per share are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Calculated using average shareholders' equity for the measurement period. 

INSURANCE OPERATIONS—comparing Q4 2021 with Q4 2020: 

Life insurance accounted for 64% of the Company’s insurance underwriting margin for the quarter and 70% of total premium revenue. 

Health insurance accounted for 35% of the Company's insurance underwriting margin for the quarter and 30% of total premium revenue. 

Net sales of life insurance declined 1% for the quarter and net health sales increased 3%.

INSURANCE UNDERWRITING INCOME

Insurance underwriting margin is management’s measure of profitability of the Company's life, health, and annuity segments’ underwriting performance, and consists of premiums less policy obligations, commissions and other acquisition expenses. Insurance underwriting income is the sum of the insurance underwriting margins of the life, health, and annuity segments, plus other income, less insurance administrative expenses. It excludes the investment segment, Parent Company expense, stock compensation expense and income taxes. Management believes this information helps provide a better understanding of the business and a more meaningful analysis of underwriting results by distribution channel. Insurance underwriting income, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of net operating income, which is reconciled to net income in the Results of Operations section above.

The following table summarizes Globe Life's insurance underwriting income by segment for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Administrative expenses were $70 million, up 11.4% from the year-ago quarter. The ratio of administrative expenses to premium was 6.7%, compared with 6.5% for the year-ago quarter.

INVESTMENTS 

Management uses excess investment income as the measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest on debt. We also view excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate performance of the investment segment, since it takes into consideration our stock repurchase program. 

The following table summarizes Globe Life's investment income, excess investment income, and excess investment income per diluted common share.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Interest on net policy liabilities is a component of total policyholder benefits, a GAAP measure.

Net investment income increased 1.8%, and average invested assets increased 4.6%. Required interest on net policy liabilities increased 5.6%, and average net policy liabilities increased 4.4%. The weighted average discount rate for the net policy liabilities was 5.8% and was in line with the year-ago quarter.

SHARE REPURCHASE:

During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1.6 million shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $145 million and an average share price of $90.97. 

For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 4.8 million shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $455 million and an average share price of $95.11.

LIQUIDITY/CAPITAL: 

Globe Life's operations consist primarily of writing basic protection life and supplemental health insurance policies which generate strong and stable cash flows. These cash flows are not impacted by volatile equity markets. Liquidity at the Parent Company is sufficient to meet additional capital needs of the insurance companies.

EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2022: 

Globe Life projects that net operating income per share will be in the range of $8.00 to $8.50 for the year ending December 31, 2022, down from prior projections primarily due to higher non-COVID life policy obligations and health claims than previously anticipated. 

NON-GAAP MEASURES: 

In this news release, Globe Life includes non-GAAP measures to enhance investors' understanding of management's view of the business. The non-GAAP measures are not a substitute for GAAP, but rather a supplement to increase transparency by providing broader perspective. Globe Life's definitions of non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies' definitions.
