“We exit 2021 feeling very grateful for the tireless efforts of all of our employees to help Pentair deliver for our customers and create value for shareholders despite significant inflation and global supply chain challenges,” said John L. Stauch, Pentair’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “I am humbled and proud of how our employees remained agile and accountable throughout all of 2021.”

Full year 2021 sales were $3.76 billion. Sales were up 25 percent compared to sales for the same period last year. Excluding currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, core sales grew 21 percent in 2021. Full year 2021 EPS from continuing operations was $3.32 compared to $2.13 in 2020. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported EPS of $3.40 compared to $2.50 in 2020. 

Full year 2021 operating income was $637 million, up 38 percent compared to operating income in 2020, and return on sales (“ROS”) was 16.9 percent, an increase of 160 basis points when compared to 2020.

Mr. Stauch continued, “Our residential businesses remained strong and we saw continued recovery in both our commercial and industrial businesses throughout the year. Even though we exited 2021 with near record backlog, we were extremely proud to deliver robust growth in sales, income, and EPS while also expanding margins. Our balance sheet ended the year well positioned as we delivered another strong year of free cash flow. In 2021, we returned half of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in addition to funding two strategic acquisitions that help build out our water treatment and pool capabilities. We recently announced a dividend increase that will mark the 46th consecutive year of Pentair raising its dividend, an important component of our long-term capital allocation strategy.”

Consumer Solutions sales were up 31 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to sales for the same period last year. Excluding currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, core sales grew 23 percent in the fourth quarter.

Fourth quarter ROS was negatively impacted by the lower margin contribution from recent acquisitions, increased inflation, and ongoing supply chain inefficiencies.

OUTLOOK

Mr. Stauch concluded, “While we enter 2022 with continued uncertainty around COVID-19 impacts and global supply chain stability, we remain confident of the long-term growth trends in all of our businesses. Our Residential businesses primarily benefit from our installed base and many of our customers are signaling strong order trends, which we believe bodes well for our Pool, Water Treatment, and Residential Flow businesses. Commercial demand continues to improve and is another positive indicator for our Water Treatment business. Finally, our Industrial facing businesses saw orders and backlog improve as the year progressed, which builds confidence in further growth in the new year. We believe we are well positioned for 2022 and our efforts in 2021 highlight our ability to be agile and navigate the continued challenging environment we are all facing to start the new year.”
