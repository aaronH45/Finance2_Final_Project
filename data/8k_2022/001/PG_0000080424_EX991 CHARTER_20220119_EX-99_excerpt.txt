The Procter & Gamble Company Regulation G Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 

In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in Procter & Gamble's January 19, 2022 earnings call, associated slides, and other materials and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period financial results. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. Certain of these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results. 

The measures provided are as follows: 

  1.   Organic sales growth — page 3     

  2.   Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS — page 5     

  3.   Core gross margin and currency-neutral Core gross margin – page 7     

  4.   Core operating profit margin and currency-neutral Core operating profit margin — page 7     

  5.   Adjusted free cash flow productivity — page 7     

The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: 

  ◾   Incremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. Beginning in 2012, the Company had a strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that resulted in incremental restructuring charges. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. In fiscal 2021 and onwards, the Company incurred restructuring costs within our historical ongoing level.     

  ◾   Early debt extinguishment charges: In the three months ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded after tax charges of $427 million ($512 million before tax), due to early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished.      

We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. 

Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, the impact from India Goods and Services Tax changes (which were effective on July 1, 2017), the impact of Venezuela deconsolidation in 2016 and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Management believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. 

Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS*: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. 

Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. For the three months ended December 31, 2021 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2020, there are no adjustments to or reconciling items for gross margin. 

Currency-neutral Core gross margin: Currency-neutral Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's Core gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. 

Core operating profit margin*: Core operating profit margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. For the three months ended December 31, 2021 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2020, there are no adjustments to or reconciling items for operating profit margin. 

Currency-neutral Core operating profit margin*: Currency-neutral Core operating profit margin is a measure of the Company's Core operating profit margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. 

Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and adjustments for items as indicated. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. 

Adjusted free cash flow productivity*: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. This measure is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. 

* Measure is used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.
