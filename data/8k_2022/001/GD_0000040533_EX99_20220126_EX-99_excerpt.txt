•Fourth-quarter net earnings of $952 million and diluted EPS of $3.39 on $10.3 billion in revenue

•Full-year net earnings of $3.3 billion and diluted EPS of $11.55 on $38.5 billion in revenue

•Record-high revenue and operating earnings from the collective defense segments for the year

•Highest Gulfstream orders in more than a decade

RESTON, Va. – General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported quarterly net earnings of $952 million, or $3.39 diluted earnings per share (EPS), on $10.3 billion in revenue. For the full year, net earnings were $3.3 billion, or $11.55 per diluted share, on revenue of $38.5 billion. 

Operating margin was 11.5% for the quarter and 10.8% for the full year. The defense segments collectively delivered revenue and operating earnings for the year that were the highest in the company’s history.

“Our continued focus on operating performance and protecting the health and safety of our employees contributed to strong fourth-quarter and full-year results,” said Phebe N. Novakovic, chairman and chief executive officer. “Furthermore, favorable cash flow has enabled us to continue reducing debt, returning value to shareholders and investing in future growth.”

Cash

Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter totaled $1.7 billion, or 177% of net earnings. For the year, net cash provided by operating activities totaled a record-high $4.3 billion, or 131% of net earnings. For the year, the company reduced debt by $1.5 billion, invested $887 million in capital expenditures, paid $1.3 billion in dividends, and repurchased $1.8 billion in shares, ending 2021 with $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents on hand. 

Backlog

Orders remained strong across the company with a consolidated book-to-bill ratio, defined as orders divided by revenue, of 1-to-1 for the quarter and the year. In addition to company-wide backlog of $87.6 billion, estimated potential contract value, representing management’s estimate of additional value in unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options, was $39.9 billion at year end. Total estimated contract value, the sum of all backlog components, was $127.5 billion.

In the Aerospace segment, backlog grew in the quarter to $16.3 billion, up 40% from the year-ago quarter, driven by the strongest order-year for Gulfstream since 2008. Book-to-bill was 1.7-to-1 for the quarter and 1.6-to-1 for the year.

Significant awards in the quarter for the Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies segments included $1.1 billion for several key contracts for classified customers and options totaling $140 million of additional potential value; $820 million from the U.S. Navy to provide ongoing lead yard services for the Virginia-class submarine program; $555 million to produce Piranha 5 wheeled armored vehicles and provide associated support services to the Romanian Armed Forces; a contract with a maximum potential value of $535 million for hardware, software and logistics sustainment support for the U.S. Army; $355 million with a maximum potential value of $600 million to design, develop, implement and operate a state’s healthcare exchange; $305 million for the production of an M1A2 Abrams tank variant for an international customer; and a contract with a maximum potential value of $220 million for the development, production and sustainment of a cryptographic touchscreen wireless device for the Army.

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION - (UNAUDITED)

DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS

(a)Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity as of year end.

(b)Book value per share is calculated as total equity divided by total outstanding shares as of year end. 

(c)Includes independent research and development and Aerospace product-development costs.

(d)Return on sales is calculated as net earnings divided by revenue.

(e)Return on equity is calculated by dividing net earnings by our average total equity during the year. Average total equity is calculated using the total equity balance at the end of the preceding year and the total equity balances at the end of each of the four quarters of the year presented. 

(f)We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management.

(g)We believe return on invested capital (ROIC) is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as net earnings plus after-tax interest and amortization expense, calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and average shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss. Average debt and average shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss are calculated using the respective balances at the end of the preceding year and the respective balances at the end of each of the four quarters of the year presented. ROIC excludes goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance. 

(h)We believe net debt is a useful measure for investors because it reflects the borrowings that support our operations and capital deployment strategy. We use net debt as an important indicator of liquidity and financial position.

*The estimated potential contract value includes work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, including options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase new aircraft and aircraft services. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. For IDIQ contracts, we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value.
