RECOMMENDED MERGER 

of 

AVAST PLC 

with 

NORTONLIFELOCK INC. 

Updated Merger Timetable 

On 10 August 2021, the boards of Avast plc (“Avast” or the “Company”) and NortonLifeLock Inc. (“NortonLifeLock”) announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended merger of Avast with NortonLifeLock, in the form of a recommended offer by Nitro Bidco Limited (“Bidco”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of NortonLifeLock, for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of the Company (the “Merger”). The Merger is proposed to be effected by means of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act (the “Scheme”), and is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the scheme document that was published on 28 October 2021 (the “Scheme Document”). Save as otherwise defined, capitalised terms in this announcement have the same meanings as set out in the Scheme Document. 

In the Scheme Document, the parties stated that they expected the Scheme to become Effective in mid-2022. However, NortonLifeLock and Avast now expect, subject to the satisfaction or, if applicable, waiver by NortonLifeLock of each of the Regulatory Conditions that have not yet been satisfied or waived: 

 ·the Election Return Time and Election Withdrawal Deadline to be 1.00 p.m. on 22 February 2022; 

 ·the Court Hearing to take place on 23 February 2022; and 

 ·the Effective Date to be 24 February 2022. 

The outstanding Regulatory Conditions are approvals by (or the completion of review processes by) the antitrust authorities in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain (comprising, respectively, Conditions 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8), together with regulatory approvals from CFIUS (in the United States) and under the UK’s National Security and Investment Act 2021 (comprising, respectively, Conditions 3.12 and 3.13.5). 

An updated expected timetable of principal events is set out below. The dates and times in the timetable are indicative only, are based on Avast’s and NortonLifeLock’s current expectations, and may be subject to changes. These dates and times will depend, among other things, on the date(s) upon which: (i) the Conditions are satisfied or (if capable of waiver) waived; (ii) the Court sanctions the Scheme; and (iii) the Court Order is delivered to the Registrar of Companies. 

If any of the expected times and/or dates in this announcement change, the revised times and/or dates will be announced through a Regulatory Information Service.

No offer or solicitation 

This announcement is for information purposes only and is not intended to and does not constitute, or form any part of, an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy or an invitation to purchase or subscribe for any securities or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction pursuant to the Merger or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law or regulation.

Any voting decision or response in relation to the Merger should be made solely on the basis of the information contained in the Scheme Document, the Forms of Proxy, the Form of Election and the NortonLifeLock Prospectus. This announcement does not constitute a prospectus or a prospectus exempted document. 

Overseas shareholders 

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom may be restricted by law and therefore any persons who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom (including Restricted Jurisdictions) should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction to vote their Avast Shares in respect of the Scheme at the Meetings, or to execute and deliver the Forms of Proxy (appointing another to vote at the Meetings on their behalf) or the Form of Election, may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located or to which they are subject. Any failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements of any jurisdiction may constitute a violation of securities laws in that jurisdiction. 

Copies of this announcement and any formal documentation relating to the Merger are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction, including any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of such jurisdiction, and persons receiving such documents (including custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction. Doing so may render invalid any related purported vote in respect of acceptance of the Merger. 

If the Merger is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), the Takeover Offer may not be made, directly or indirectly, in or into or by use of the mails or any other means or instrumentality (including facsimile, e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction and the Merger will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or from within any Restricted Jurisdiction. 

Further details in relation to Avast Shareholders in overseas jurisdictions are contained in the Scheme Document. 

Notice to U.S. investors in Avast 

The Merger relates to the shares of an English company and is being made by means of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act. A scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules or the proxy solicitation rules under the U.S. Exchange Act and other requirements of U.S. law. Accordingly, the Merger is subject to the disclosure requirements and practices applicable to a scheme of arrangement involving a target company in England listed on the London Stock Exchange, which differ from the disclosure requirements of U.S. tender offer and proxy solicitation rules. If, in the future, Bidco exercises its right to implement the Merger by way of a Takeover Offer and determines to extend the Takeover Offer into the U.S., the Merger will be made in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. 

The New NortonLifeLock Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The New NortonLifeLock Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger will be issued pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) under the U.S. Securities Act. If, in the future, Bidco exercises its right to implement the Merger by way of a Takeover Offer or otherwise in a manner that is not exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, it will file a registration statement with the SEC that will contain a prospectus with respect to the issuance of New NortonLifeLock Shares. In this event, Avast Shareholders are urged to read these documents and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information, and such documents will be available free of charge at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to NortonLifeLock’s Investor Relations team identified above. 

New NortonLifeLock Shares issued to persons other than “affiliates” of NortonLifeLock (defined as certain control persons, within the meaning of Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act) will be freely transferable under US law after the Merger. Persons (whether or not US persons) who are or will be “affiliates” of NortonLifeLock within 90 days prior to, or of the Combined Company after, the Effective Date will be subject to certain transfer restrictions relating to the New NortonLifeLock Shares under US law. 

Neither the SEC nor any U.S. state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the New NortonLifeLock Shares to be issued in connection with the Merger, or determined if this announcement is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States. 

Financial information relating to Avast included in the Scheme Document has been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom and may not be comparable to financial information of U.S. companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP differs in certain significant respects from accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom. 

Avast is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. In addition, some of its officers and directors reside outside the United States, and some or all of its assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the United States. Therefore, investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the United States upon those persons or recovering against Avast or its officers or directors on judgments of United States federal, state or district courts, including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. It may not be possible to sue Avast or its officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of the U.S. securities laws. 

Forward-looking statements 

This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the NortonLifeLock Group and the Avast Group. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipate”, “target”, “expect”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “goal”, “believe”, “aim”, “will”, “may”, “would”, “could” or “should” or other words of similar meaning or the negative thereof. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, economic performance, financial conditions, dividend policy, losses and future prospects, (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of the operations of the NortonLifeLock Group or the Avast Group, (iii) the effects of government regulation on the business of the NortonLifeLock Group or the Avast Group, (iv) expectation as to timing of future events and (v) satisfaction or waiver of Regulatory Conditions. There are many factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such factors include the possibility that the Merger will not be completed on a timely basis (including the timelines set forth in this announcement) or at all, whether due to the failure to satisfy or waive the conditions of the Merger (including approvals or clearances from regulatory and other agencies and bodies) or otherwise, general business and economic conditions globally, industry trends, competition, changes in government and other regulation, changes in political and economic stability, disruptions in business operations due to reorganisation activities, interest rate and currency fluctuations, the inability of the Combined Company to realise successfully any anticipated synergy benefits when (and if) the Merger is implemented, the inability of the Combined Company to integrate successfully (or at all, or on a timely basis) the operations of the NortonLifeLock Group and the Avast Group when (and if) the Merger is implemented and the Combined Company incurring and/or experiencing unanticipated costs and/or delays or difficulties relating to the Merger and/or integration when (and if) it is implemented. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors is contained in the Risk Factors sections of NortonLifeLock’s most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, the NortonLifeLock Proxy Statement and the NortonLifeLock Prospectus, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, nor do they form part of, this announcement. 

These forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the present and future business strategies of such persons and the environment in which each will operate in the future. By their nature, these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, as well as uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this announcement may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of any such person, or industry results and developments, to be materially different from any results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this announcement are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as at the date of this announcement. All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to the NortonLifeLock Group or the Avast Group or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. None of NortonLifeLock, Bidco or Avast undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rules. 

No profit forecasts or estimates 

No statement in this announcement is intended as, or is to be construed as, a profit forecast or estimate for any period and no statement in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per ordinary share, for NortonLifeLock or Avast, respectively for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per ordinary share for NortonLifeLock or Avast, respectively. 

Publication on website 

A copy of this announcement will be made available (subject to certain restrictions relating to persons resident in Restricted Jurisdictions) on Avast’s website (at https://investors.avast.com/) and on NortonLifeLock’s website (at https://investor.nortonlifelock.com/) by no later than 12 noon London time on the business day following the date of this announcement.

Dealing and opening position disclosure requirements of the Code 

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person who is interested in one per cent or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the Offer Period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th Business Day (as defined in the Code) following the commencement of the Offer Period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th Business Day (as defined in the Code) following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure. 

Under Rule 8.3(b) of the Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in one per cent or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s), save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the Business Day (as defined in the Code) following the date of the relevant dealing.  

If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3. 

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). 

Details of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at http://www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the Offer Period commenced and when any offeror was first identified.
