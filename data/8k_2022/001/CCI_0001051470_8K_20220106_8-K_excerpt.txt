ITEM 7.01—REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE

On January 6, 2022, Crown Castle International Corp. ("Crown Castle") and T-Mobile US, Inc. ("T-Mobile") announced that they entered into a long-term agreement ("Agreement"). The following are additional details regarding the Agreement:

•The 12-year Agreement includes contracted new tower leasing activity and a base escalator that is consistent with historical levels for Crown Castle’s Towers segment. As a result, Crown Castle expects to recognize approximately $250 million of additional straight-lined site rental revenues for full year 2022 for its Towers segment when compared to the Full Year 2022 Outlook issued on October 20, 2021.

•The Agreement also includes a contractual commitment by T-Mobile for 35,000 new small cell nodes, including specific commitments in each of the next five years to enter into contracts associated with identified small cell locations. The majority of the committed small cell nodes are expected to be collocated on existing Crown Castle fiber. 

•Crown Castle anticipates the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation contemplated in the Agreement will result in tower non-renewals in 2025 which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately $200 million. Except for full year 2025, Crown Castle expects consolidated annual tower non-renewals to remain in line with the Company’s historical range of 1% to 2% of annual site rental revenues.

•Crown Castle also anticipates the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation will result in small cell non-renewals which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately $45 million, with the majority occurring in 2023. The financial impact of the anticipated non-renewals is expected to be offset by approximately $10 million per year during the corresponding small cell contract term from the amortization of anticipated upfront payments to be made by T-Mobile associated with certain of those non-renewals. Except for full year 2023, Crown Castle expects consolidated annual small cell non-renewals to remain in line with the Company’s historical range of 1% to 2% of annual site rental revenues.

•Crown Castle’s long-term annual growth target for its common stock dividend remains 7% to 8%. Due to the network consolidation non-renewals in 2025 mentioned above, the Company expects its dividend growth in 2025 to be below its long-term annual target. 

The January 6, 2022 press release announcing the Agreement is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The above disclosure does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Agreement.
