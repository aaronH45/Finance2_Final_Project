 Item 2.02.  

Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

The IER Report (as defined below) includes certain non-public information regarding the results of operations and financial condition of Mallinckrodt plc, an Irish public limited company (“Mallinckrodt”) in examination under Part 10 of the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Such information is incorporated into this Item 2.02 by reference.  

The information contained in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall be deemed to be “furnished” and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the Exchange Act.  

 Item 7.01.  

Regulation FD Disclosure.  

As previously disclosed, on October 12, 2020, Mallinckrodt and certain of its subsidiaries voluntarily initiated proceedings under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). On February 3, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an opinion stating its intention to confirm the Mallinckrodt’s Fourth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Mallinckrodt and Its Debtor Affiliates Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Plan”). It is expected that the Bankruptcy Court will enter a forthcoming order confirming the Plan.  

As previously disclosed, it is a condition precedent to the consummation of the Plan that the High Court of Ireland shall make an order pursuant to Section 541 of the Companies Act of Ireland confirming a scheme of arrangement with respect to Mallinckrodt which is based on and consistent in all respects with the Plan (a “Scheme of Arrangement”), and that such Scheme of Arrangement shall become effective in accordance with its terms (or shall become effective concurrently with the effectiveness of the Plan). As contemplated by the Plan, and in furtherance of the satisfaction of such condition precedent, on February 14, 2022 the directors of Mallinckrodt initiated examinership proceedings with respect to Mallinckrodt (the “Irish Examinership Proceedings”) by presenting a petition (the “Examinership Petition”) to the High Court of Ireland pursuant to Section 510(1)(b) of the Companies Act of Ireland seeking the appointment of an examiner to Mallinckrodt (the “Examiner”). On the same date, following an ex parte application made by the directors of Mallinckrodt, the High Court of Ireland made an order appointing the Examiner on an interim basis pending the hearing of the Examinership Petition. The hearing of the Examinership Petition is scheduled to take place before the High Court in Dublin, Ireland at 11am (Irish time) on Monday, February 28, 2022. In addition, the High Court of Ireland directed that any interested party wishing to oppose the appointment of the Examiner must notify Arthur Cox, as Irish solicitors to Mallinckrodt, and file any opposing affidavits, by February 23, 2022. Furthermore, as required by Section 511 of the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland, the Examinership Petition filed with the High Court of Ireland was accompanied by an independent expert’s report with respect to Mallinckrodt (the “IER”), which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.Subject to certain conditions, the Examiner will seek to convene meetings of the creditors and shareholders of Mallinckrodt for the purposes of considering and voting in relation to a proposed Scheme of Arrangement.  

During the continuance of the Irish Examinership Proceedings, Mallinckrodt will be under the protection of the High Court of Ireland. During the period of court protection, no proceedings can be commenced in Ireland to wind up Mallinckrodt, and no action can be taken by creditors to enforce security or take possession of any assets of Mallinckrodt, without the consent of the Examiner. The period of court protection will subsist for an initial 70 days, which can, in certain circumstances, be extended by order of the High Court of Ireland for a further 30 days, and potentially an additional 50 days after such 30-day period.  

Additional information about the Irish Examinership Proceeding is available at www.advancingmnk.com. Court filings and other information related to the Irish Examinership Proceeding (including copies of the Examinership Petition and the IER) are available on a separate website administered by Mallinckrodt’s claims agent, Prime Clerk, at http://restructuring.primeclerk.com/Mallinckrodt; by calling Prime Clerk representatives toll-free in the U.S. and Canada at 877-467-1570 or 347-817-4093 for international calls; or by emailing Prime Clerk at MallinckrodtInfo@primeclerk.com.  

The information contained in this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, shall be deemed to be “furnished” and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act.
