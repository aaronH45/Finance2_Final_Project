 Howmet Aerospace (NYSE: HWM) today reported fourth quarter 2021 and full year 2021 results. The Company reported fourth quarter revenues of $1.3 billion, up 4% year over year, primarily driven by growth in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets as well as favorable product pricing, partially offset by declines in the defense aerospace market. Additionally, income from continuing operations was $77 million, or $0.18 per share, in the fourth quarter 2021 versus income from continuing operations of $106 million, or $0.24 per share, in the fourth quarter 2020. Income from continuing operations excluding special items was $130 million, or $0.30 per share, in the fourth quarter 2021, versus $92 million, or $0.21 per share, in the fourth quarter 2020. Income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter 2021 included a $53 million charge from special items, principally related to settling pension liabilities.

 Fourth quarter 2021 operating income was $147 million, down 33% year over year. Operating income excluding special items was $229 million, up 7% year over year. The year-over-year increase was driven by growth in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, variable and fixed cost reductions, and favorable product pricing, partially offset by declines in the defense aerospace market. Operating income margin, excluding special items, was up approximately 40 basis points year over year to 17.8%.  

 Full year 2021 operating income was $748 million, up 19% versus the full year 2020. Operating income excluding special items was $866 million, up 7% versus the full year 2020. The year-over-year increase was driven by growth in the commercial transportation and industrial gas turbine markets, variable and fixed cost reductions, and favorable product pricing, partially offset by declines in the commercial aerospace and defense aerospace markets. Operating income margin, excluding special items, was up approximately 200 basis points year over year to 17.4%.  

 Howmet Aerospace Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Plant said, “Howmet Aerospace delivered a strong finish to a challenging 2021, performing well despite the effects of the new COVID-19 variant and continued lack of Boeing 787 aircraft build. Fourth quarter 2021 revenue increased 4% year over year and was in line with the third quarter 2021, while adjusted EBITDA margin of 23% exceeded expectations and marked a healthy exit rate heading into 2022. Full year Adjusted Free Cash Flow was strong at $517 million, well ahead of expectations with healthy conversion of net income.”  

 Mr. Plant continued, “The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement, particularly for domestic travel. We expect to see accelerating revenue growth through 2022 following a flat first quarter 2022 relative to fourth quarter 2021.”  

 “Our liquidity position remains strong, supported by continued solid free cash flow generation. We ended 2021 with approximately $722 million of cash, after reducing debt by approximately $845 million, repurchasing $430 million of stock, and reinstating our common stock dividend during the year. Debt actions taken over the course of 2021 will reduce annualized interest costs by approximately $70 million. Furthermore, we repurchased an additional $100 million of stock in January 2022, demonstrating confidence in future cash flow generation.”

 * Excluding Special Items    

 1 Reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures (including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted earnings per share, each excluding special items, and adjusted free cash flow) to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as the directly comparable GAAP measures, are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity of the charges and other components excluded from the non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes, and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume. Howmet Aerospace believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.

 The separation of Arconic Inc. into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Howmet Aerospace Inc. and Arconic Corporation, (the “Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction”) occurred on April 1, 2020. The cash flows related to Arconic Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the first quarter of 2020.

 Differences between the total segment and consolidated totals are in Corporate.

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Total segment operating profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the Company by Segment excluding the impacts of Corporate, Restructuring and other charges, and Other special items (collectively, “Special items”). There can be no assurances that additional Special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Income (loss) from continuing operations determined under GAAP as well as Total segment operating profit.    

 (1)      

 For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, Corporate expense included $4 of costs associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, $11 of costs related to fires at two plants, net of reimbursement, $3 of costs associated with closures and shutdowns, and ($1) of net reimbursement related to legal and advisory charges related to Grenfell Tower. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, Corporate expense included $3 of costs associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, ($6) of reimbursement related to legal and advisory charges related to Grenfell Tower, and $4 of costs related to fires at two plants, net of reimbursement. For the quarter ended September 30, 2020, Corporate expense included ($2) of reimbursement related to legal and advisory charges related to Grenfell Tower and $7 of costs related to fires at two plants, net of reimbursement. For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Corporate expense included ($3) of reimbursement related to legal and advisory charges related to Grenfell Tower and ($19) of net reimbursement related to fires at two plants. For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, Corporate expense included $10 of costs related to fires at two plants, net of reimbursement. For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, Corporate expense included ($4) of reimbursement related to legal and advisory charges related to Grenfell Tower and ($3) of net reimbursement related to fires at two plants. For the quarter ended September 30, 2021, Corporate expense included $10 of costs associated with closures, shutdowns, and other items and $1 of costs related to fires at two plants, net of reimbursement. For the quarter ended December 31, 2021, Corporate expense included $25 of costs associated with closures, shutdowns, and other items and ($11) of net reimbursement related to fires at two plants.

 The net cash funding from the sale of accounts receivables was neither a use of cash nor a source of cash in all periods presented.  

 In the third quarter of 2021, the Company restructured its accounts receivable securitization. As a result, going forward, Cash receipts from sold receivables (which had been included in the investing section of the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows) will be $0 as the entire impact of the accounts receivable securitization program will be included in the Cash (used for) provided from operations section of the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. Consequently, for the fourth quarter of 2021 and full year 2022, the definition of Adjusted free cash flow is Cash (used for) provided from operations less Capital expenditures.  

 Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures (due to the fact that these expenditures are considered necessary to maintain and expand the Company's asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations), as well as cash receipts from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables. It is important to note that Adjusted free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure.

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Income from continuing operations excluding Special items, Income from continuing operations excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments, Diluted EPS excluding Special items, and Diluted EPS excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the Company excluding the impacts of Restructuring and other charges, Discrete tax items, and Other special items (collectively, “Special items”). In addition, management believes that the Income from continuing operations excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments and Diluted EPS excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments are meaningful to investors as it reflects how management reviewed the standalone costs of Howmet in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 as if the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction had happened on January 1, 2020. There can be no assurances that additional Special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Income from continuing operations determined under GAAP as well as Income from continuing operations excluding Special items.    

 (1)    

 Discrete tax items for each period included the following:    

 •    

 for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, a benefit related to the release of a reserve as a result of a favorable Spanish tax case decision ($64), a benefit related to the recognition of a previously uncertain U.S. tax position ($30), a charge for adjustment related to a U.S. tax law change $6, a charge related to tax rate changes in various jurisdictions $4, a net charge for prior year items $4, and a net charge for other items $4;    

 •    

 for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, a net benefit related to prior year amended returns and audit settlements ($13), and a net charge for other items $1;    

 •    

 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, a charge related to valuation allowance adjustments $12, a charge related to prior year earnings distributed or no longer considered permanently reinvested $9, and a net benefit for other items ($3);    

 •    

 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a benefit related to the release of a reserve as a result of a favorable Spanish tax case decision ($64), a benefit related to the recognition of a previously uncertain U.S. tax position ($30), a benefit for a U.S. tax law change ($30), charges resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax balances in various jurisdictions as a result of the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction $8, a charge related to tax rate changes in various jurisdictions $4, and a net benefit for a number of small tax items ($3); and

 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a net benefit related to prior year amended returns and audit settlements ($14), a charge related to prior year foreign earnings distributed or no longer considered permanently reinvested $13, a net charge related to valuation allowance adjustments $9, and a net charge for other items $1.    

 (2)    

 The tax impact on Special items is based on the applicable statutory rates whereby the difference between such rates and the Company’s consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate is itself a Special item.    

 (3)    

 Adjustments include differences between allocations as required under discontinued operations as part of generally accepted accounting principles and estimated actual spending in selling, general administrative, and other expenses and miscellaneous non-operating income related to pension, other post retirement benefits, and foreign exchange related to Howmet on a standalone basis as if the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction had occurred on January 1, 2020.

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operational tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the Company excluding the impacts of Special items. There can be no assurances that additional Special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both the Effective tax rate determined under GAAP as well as the Operational tax rate.    

 (1)      

 Special items for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 include Restructuring and other charges $68, costs associated with closures, shutdowns, and other items $25, and debt tender fees and related costs $4, partially offset by ($11) net reimbursement related to fires at two plants. Special items for the year ended December 31, 2021 include debt tender fees and related costs $147, Restructuring and other charges $90, and costs associated with closures, shutdowns, and other items $35, partially offset by ($4) reimbursement related to legal and advisory charges related to Grenfell Tower and ($3) net reimbursement related to fires at two plants.    

 (2)      

 Tax Special items includes discrete tax items, the tax impact on Special items based on the applicable statutory rates, the difference between such rates and the Company’s consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate and other tax related items. Discrete tax items for each period included the following:    

 •    

 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, a charge related to valuation allowance adjustments $12, a charge related to prior year earnings distributed or no longer considered permanently reinvested $9, and a net benefit for other items ($3); and    

 •    

 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a net benefit related to prior year amended returns and audit settlements ($14), a charge related to prior year foreign earnings distributed or no longer considered permanently reinvested $13, a net charge related to valuation allowance adjustments $9, and a net charge for other items $1.

 Operating income excluding Special items, Operating income excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments, and Operating income margin excluding Special items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the Company excluding the impacts of Special items. In addition, management believes that the Operating income excluding Special items and Allocation adjustments are meaningful to investors as it reflects how management reviewed the standalone costs of Howmet in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 as if the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction had happened on January 1, 2020. There can be no assurances that additional Special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Operating income determined under GAAP as well as Operating income excluding Special items.

 Adjustments include differences between allocations as required under discontinued operations as part of generally accepted accounting principles and estimated actual spending in selling, general administrative, and other expenses related to Howmet on a standalone basis as if the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction had occurred on January 1, 2020.
