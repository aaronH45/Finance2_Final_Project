Diluted loss per share was $0.40 for the fourth quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.95. Full-year diluted earnings per share were $1.91 and full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.37. Both net sales and earnings metrics were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter by China volume-based procurement (“VBP”) in our Knees, Hips and S.E.T. product categories due to a combination of variables in advance of VBP implementation. The negative impact was in line with expectations in the Knees and Hips segments, but was not anticipated in the S.E.T. product category. In S.E.T., the nationalization of the provincial Trauma products tender was announced January 24, 2022 by the Chinese government.  

“As we expected, the ongoing COVID pandemic continued to pressure our business in Q4. The quarter was particularly impacted throughout December due to hospital staffing shortages and the Omicron variant surge worldwide,” said Bryan Hanson, Chairman, President and CEO of Zimmer Biomet. “I remain confident in our ZB strategy and incredibly proud of our ZB team. We continued to execute in the quarter and are focused on delivering on our mission and driving value for all stakeholders.”  

Planned ZimVie Spin Off Transaction  

Zimmer Biomet previously announced its intent to spin off its Dental and Spine businesses into a standalone, publicly traded company, ZimVie. The transaction is expected to close on March 1, 2022 and additional details will be announced in a separate press release this morning.  

ZimVie will host a virtual Investor Day today, February 7, 2022, from 11:00 a.m. to approximately 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The virtual event will feature presentations from ZimVie leaders outlining its Dental and Spine offerings, addressable market opportunity, financial outlook, business strategy and the broader organizations supporting these businesses. The event will feature a live Q&A panel following speaker presentations.

We use this website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts.

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

Sales change information for the three-month period and the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented on a GAAP (reported) basis and on a constant currency basis. Constant currency percentage changes exclude the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. They are calculated by translating current and prior-period sales at the same predetermined exchange rate. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases.  

Net earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three-month period and the year ended December 31, 2021 are presented on a GAAP (reported) basis and on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the effects of certain items, which are detailed in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures presented later in this press release.  

Free cash flow is an additional non-GAAP measure that is presented in this press release. Free cash flow is computed by deducting additions to instruments and other property, plant and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities.  

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this press release. This press release also contains supplemental reconciliations of additional non-GAAP financial measures that the Company presents in other contexts. These additional non-GAAP financial measures are computed from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as indicated in the applicable reconciliation.  

Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating the performance of the Company. Management believes these measures offer the ability to make period-to-period comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported income but that do not impact the fundamentals of our operations. The non-GAAP measures enable the evaluation of operating results and trend analysis by allowing a reader to better  

Page 6 of 27   

 identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items that are excluded from the non-GAAP measures. In addition, constant currency sales changes, adjusted operating profit, adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow are used as performance metrics in our incentive compensation programs.  

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

This press release also includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for the year ending December 31, 2022. We calculate forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For instance, we exclude the impact of certain charges related to initial compliance with the European Union Medical Device Regulation; restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives; quality remediation; acquisition, integration, divestiture and related; and certain legal and tax matters. We have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are not available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts. For example, the timing of certain transactions is difficult to predict because management’s plans may change. In addition, the company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. It is probable that these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

Risk Factors,” and our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Copies of these filings are available online at www.sec.gov, www.zimmerbiomet.com or on request from us.

Readers of this press release are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements since there can be no assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate. This cautionary note is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this press release.

 (1)  

Inventory and manufacturing-related charges include excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines we intend to discontinue, incremental cost of products sold from stepping up inventory to its fair value from its manufactured cost in business combination accounting and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges or gains.  

 (2)  

We exclude intangible asset amortization as well as deferred tax rate changes on our intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures because we internally assess our performance against our peers without this amortization. Due to various levels of acquisitions among our peers, intangible asset amortization can vary significantly from company to company.  

 (3)  

In the first quarter of 2020, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $470.0 million and $142.0 million related to our EMEA and Dental reporting units, respectively. In the second quarters of 2021 and 2020, we recognized $16.3 million and $33.0 million, respectively, of in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) intangible asset impairments on certain IPR&D projects.  

 (4)  

In 2019 and 2021, our Board of Directors approved, and we initiated, new global restructuring programs that include a reorganization of key businesses and an overall effort to reduce costs in order to accelerate decision-making and focus the organization on priorities to drive growth. Restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives also include other cost reduction initiatives that have the goal of reducing costs across the organization. The costs include employee termination benefits; contract terminations for facilities and sales agents; and other charges, such as retention period salaries and benefits and relocation costs.  

 (5)  

We are addressing inspectional observations on Form 483 and a Warning Letter issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) following its previous inspections of our Warsaw North Campus facility, among other matters. This quality remediation has required us to devote significant financial resources. The majority of the expenses are related to consultants who are helping us to update previous documents and redesign certain processes.  

 (6)  

The acquisition, integration, divestiture and related gains and expenses we have excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures resulted from the planned spinoff of ZimVie (our Spine and Dental businesses) and various acquisitions.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (8)  

The European Union Medical Device Regulation imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements. The new regulations provided a transition period until May 2021 for previously-approved medical devices to meet the additional requirements. For certain devices, this transition period can be extended until May 2024. We are excluding from our non-GAAP financial measures the incremental costs incurred to establish initial compliance with the regulations related to our previously-approved medical devices. The incremental costs primarily include temporary personnel and third-party professionals necessary to supplement our internal resources.  

 (9)  

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into certain agreements to gain access to or acquire third-party IPR&D projects.  

 (10)  

We have incurred other various expenses from specific events or projects that we consider highly variable or that have a significant impact to our operating results that we have excluded from our non-GAAP measures. These include costs related to legal entity, distribution and manufacturing optimization, including contract terminations, gains and losses from changes in fair value on our equity investments, as well as, in the 2020 period, our costs of complying with a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the U.S. government related to certain Foreign Corrupt Practices Act matters involving Biomet and certain of its subsidiaries, which DPA concluded in February 2021.  

 (11)  

We recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of cash tender offers for certain outstanding series of senior notes of the Company.  

 (12)  

We recognized a tax benefit related to Switzerland’s Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“TRAF”) in addition to an impact from certain restructuring transactions in Switzerland. Also included are tax adjustments relating to ongoing impacts of tax only amortization resulting from TRAF as well as certain restructuring transactions in Switzerland.  

Page 21 of 27   

 (13)  

Other certain tax adjustments relate to various discrete tax period adjustments as well as US tax reform planning.  

 (14)  

Due to the reported net loss for certain periods, the effect of dilutive shares assuming net earnings is shown as an adjustment. Diluted share count used in Adjusted Diluted EPS is:
