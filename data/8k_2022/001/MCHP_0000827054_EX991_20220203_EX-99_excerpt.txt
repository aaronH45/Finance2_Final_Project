Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were a record $1.758 billion, up 30.0% from net sales of $1.352 billion in the prior year's third fiscal quarter.

GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $352.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, up from GAAP net income of $36.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, GAAP net income was significantly adversely impacted by purchase accounting adjustments associated with our acquisitions.

Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was a record at $681.7 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, up from non-GAAP net income of $444.9 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, IT security remediation costs, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, losses on the settlement of debt, and gains related to equity investments. For the third quarters of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.

Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 25.3 cents per share, up 9.1% from the cash dividend paid last quarter and up 29.7% from the year ago quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 8, 2022 to stockholders of record on February 22, 2022.

"Our December quarter results continued to be strong, with revenue growing 6.5% sequentially and 30.0% year-over-year despite ongoing manufacturing capacity constraints," said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. "December quarter revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP EPS were all records. Our December 2021 quarter operating margin of 44.6% was up 210 basis points from 42.5% in the September 2021 quarter and was well above the high end of our guidance."

Mr. Moorthy added, "Overall business conditions remained very strong in the December quarter with high levels of bookings and record backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters, accentuated by our Preferred Supply Program which continues to be greater than 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity areas. Similar to the September quarter, in the December quarter demand outpaced the

capacity improvements we implemented, resulting in our unsupported backlog continuing to climb and our lead times stretching out."

Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair, said, "Microchip's Board of Directors approved a sequential increase in our dividend of 9.1%, to a record 25.3 cents per share, up from our November dividend of 23.2 cents per share. The dividend announced today also represents a 29.7% year-over-year increase. Our Board of Directors is now targeting to increase our dividend at least 9% sequentially, which is up from the 7% sequential increases communicated at our Investor and Analyst Day on November 8, 2021."

Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "We continued to aggressively pay down our debt with another $362.7 million of payments during the December quarter, reflecting a cumulative debt pay down of $4.77 billion over the past 14 quarters, as we have actively managed the working capital requirements for the business. In the December quarter, we exchanged $96.2 million of dilutive convertible debentures for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. We also refinanced our revolving line of credit to be in line with our investment grade rating and decreased the size of the facility from $3.6 billion to $2.75 billion. We remain focused on continuing to enhance our capital structure in the future."

Mr. Moorthy concluded, "Our backlog for the March quarter is very strong. We also have considerable backlog requested by customers in the March quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from last quarter. Additionally, our supply in the March quarter is expected to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 Omicron variant which has increased the level of factory workforce absentees. Given this backdrop, we expect our net sales in the March quarter to be up between 2% and 5% sequentially. At the mid-point of our guidance for the March quarter, net sales will be 24% higher than the year ago quarter."

Microchip's Highlights for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2021:

•Unveiled its new ISO 26262 functional safety packages simplifying design of ASIL B and ASIL C safety applications using dsPIC®, PIC18 and AVR® microcontrollers, accelerating development and certification of automotive safety applications.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Outlook:

The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this release for information regarding our non-GAAP guidance.

(2) We are not able to estimate the amount of certain Special Charges and Other, net that may be incurred during the quarter ending March 31, 2022. Therefore, our estimate of GAAP operating expenses excludes certain amounts that may be recognized as Special Charges and Other, net in the quarter ending March 31, 2022.

(3) The forecast for GAAP tax expense excludes any unexpected tax events that may occur during the quarter, as these amounts cannot be forecasted.

(4) Represents the expected cash tax rate for fiscal 2022, excluding any transition tax payments associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

•Microchip's inventory days in the March 2022 quarter are expected to be in the range of 120 to 125 days, compared to 116 days on December 31, 2021. Our actual inventory level will depend on the inventory that our distributors decide to hold to support their customers, overall demand for our products, and our production levels.

•Capital expenditures for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 are expected to be between $135 million and $145 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2022 are expected to be between $390 million and $400 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing capabilities to support the expected growth of our business.

Under the GAAP revenue recognition standard, which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. Therefore, the elements of our internal performance and executive and employee

compensation metrics that are based on sales and operating results are measured using the value of the end-market demand for our products. We use end-market demand for these purposes because we do not believe that the underlying value of our business benefits from increases in the value of inventory that is held in the supply chain. As many of our products are designed into customer applications with relatively long lives, such value is only realized when the end-market demand is created, and the supply chain sells the inventory to the end customer. We define end-market demand as the net dollar amount of our products, licensing revenue, and other services delivered to our direct (non-distributor) customers and by our distributors to their customers. We are able to calculate end-market demand based on information that our distributors provide us about their product shipments to their customers and inventory holdings. The value of end-market demand from our distributors is calculated as the net transaction value of these shipments. We believe that our end-market demand metric reflects true end-market demand based on when product is sold to direct customers or by our distributors to an end customer. We believe the use of end-market demand is also important to investors and users of our financial statements as it reflects the final outcome of our sales activities, whereas our GAAP net sales are based on estimates made earlier in (or before the end of) the process of creating and fulfilling demand is complete. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires. Management uses end-market demand to manage and assess the profitability of our business and when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose end-market demand metric because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it provides better information regarding end-market demand for our products. Therefore, we believe that it is useful to investors for us to disclose end-market demand. Our determination of end-market demand metric might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, IT security remediation costs, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, losses on the settlement of debt, and gains related to equity investments. For the third quarters of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in

our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items, or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars, including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Generally, gross margin fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels.

Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading "Supplemental Financial Information"), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the March 2022 quarter between $75 and $85 per share (however,

we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).
