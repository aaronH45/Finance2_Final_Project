​

Citigroup

Citigroup revenues of $17.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2021 increased 1%, reflecting strong growth in Investment Banking, the Private Bank and Securities Services in ICG and growth in Corporate / Other, partially offset by lower revenues across regions in GCB and in Fixed Income Markets in ICG.

​

Citigroup operating expenses of $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2021 increased 18%. Excluding the impact of Asia divestitures, expenses increased 8%, driven by continued investments in Citi’s transformation, business-led investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings.

​

Citigroup cost of credit of $(0.5) billion in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to $(46) million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting an improvement in net credit losses.

​

Citigroup net income of $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter 2021 decreased 26% from the prior-year period, driven by the higher expenses, partially offset by the higher revenues and lower cost of credit. Citigroup’s effective tax rate was 19.5% in the current quarter compared to 20.5% in the fourth quarter 2020. 

​

2

Citigroup’s allowance for credit losses on loans was $16.5 billion at quarter end, or 2.49% of total loans, compared to $25.0 billion, or 3.73% of total loans, at the end of the prior-year period. Total non-accrual assets decreased 40% from the prior-year period to $3.4 billion. Consumer non-accrual loans decreased 30% to $1.5 billion, while corporate non-accrual loans of $1.9 billion decreased 47% from the prior-year period. 

​

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans of $668 billion as of quarter end decreased 1% from the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation6, loans were largely unchanged, primarily reflecting loan growth in the ICG offset by the impact of Asia divestitures.

​

Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were $1.3 trillion as of quarter end, an increase of 3% on a reported basis and 4% in constant dollars, driven by an 6% increase in GCB and a 4% increase in ICG.

​

Citigroup’s book value per share of $92.21 and tangible book value per share of $79.16 each increased 7%, largely driven by net income. At quarter end, Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 12.2%, an increase from the prior quarter driven by actions to reduce risk-weighted assets (RWA) and a temporary pause in common share repurchases in preparation for the implementation of the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk on January 1, 2022. Citigroup’s SLR for the fourth quarter 2021 was 5.7%, a decrease from the prior quarter. During the quarter, Citigroup returned a total of $1.0 billion to common shareholders in the form of common share dividends.

1 Preliminary. Citigroup’s return on average tangible common equity (RoTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. RoTCE represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity (TCE). For the components of the calculation, see Appendix A.

​

2 Ratios as of December 31, 2021 are preliminary. Commencing January 1, 2020, Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio and Supplementary Leverage ratio (SLR) reflect certain deferrals based on the modified regulatory capital transition provision related to the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) standard. Excluding the deferrals based on the modified CECL transition provision, Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio and SLR as of December 31, 2021 would be 12.0% and 5.6%, respectively, on a fully reflected basis. For additional information, please refer to the “Capital Resources” section of Citigroup’s 2020 Form 10-K.

​

For the composition of Citigroup’s CET1 Capital and ratio, see Appendix C. For the composition of Citigroup’s SLR, see Appendix D.

​

3 Citigroup’s payout ratio is the sum of common dividends and common share repurchases divided by net income available to common shareholders. For the components of the calculation, see Appendix A.

​

4 Citigroup’s tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of this measure to reported results, see Appendix E. 

​

5 Reported expenses include the impact of costs related to the Korea voluntary early retirement program (VERP) of approximately $1.1 billion (approximately $0.8 billion after-tax) and contract modification costs related to the Asia divestitures of approximately $119 million (approximately $98 million after-tax). For additional information about the Korea VERP, see Citigroup’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 25, 2021 and Citigroup’s Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on November 8, 2021.

​

Reported net income includes an approximately $160 million accrual for withholding taxes related to certain Asia divestiture markets and a pre-tax true-up loss of approximately $14 million (approximately $12 million after tax) related to the sale of the Australia consumer business. For additional information about the Australia sale, see Citigroup’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 9, 2021.

​

Results of operations excluding these Asia divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to reported results, see Appendix B.

​

​

7 Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the Private Bank and Corporate Loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains / (losses) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. In the fourth quarter 2021, gains / (losses) on loan hedges included $21 million related to Corporate Lending and $0 related to the Private Bank, compared to $(298) million related to Corporate Lending and $(14) million related to the Private Bank in the prior-year period. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the Private Bank and Corporate Lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gains / (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.
