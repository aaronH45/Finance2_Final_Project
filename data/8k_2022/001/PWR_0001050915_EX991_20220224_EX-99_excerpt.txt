“Quanta’s strong fourth quarter results complete a year in which we produced record revenues, profits and backlog, while also strategically transforming our ability to collaborate with our customers on their energy-transition initiatives. We believe our 2021 results reflect the success of our strategic initiatives and collaborative relationships with customers, as well as strong, sustainable and visible end-market drivers,” said Duke Austin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quanta Services. “I want to recognize the dedication and hard work of our world-class employees and thank them for delivering another record year for Quanta.  

“Moving towards a carbon-neutral economy is estimated by industry sources to require hundreds of billions of dollars of investment over the next several decades, a significant portion of which is expected to be invested in renewable energy generation, electric transmission and distribution systems, electric vehicle charging and other forms of clean power infrastructure. We believe Quanta is developing strong leadership positions across these service areas and expect that there are opportunities that will benefit the company for many years. In particular, we believe the addition of Blattner’s renewable generation solutions to Quanta’s existing electric power infrastructure solutions positions the company to be a leader in facilitating North America’s energy transition, much of which will be reflected in our new Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment.  

“Our 2022 expectations reflect growth in revenues, net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Demand is strong for our infrastructure solutions that support our customers’ energy-transition initiatives and that increase reliability, safety, efficiency and connectivity through modernization, which we believe will continue to provide multi-year growth opportunities. We are successfully executing on our strategic growth initiatives, which, coupled with our strong financial profile, position us well to continue to deliver value to stockholders.”  

Certain items impacted the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020 results and are reflected as adjustments in the calculation of Quanta’s adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure). These items are described in the accompanying tables reconciling adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock. Quanta completed ten and seven acquisitions during 2021 and 2020, and the results of the acquired businesses are included in Quanta’s consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. For further information on the items that impacted comparability of 2021 and 2020, see the footnotes to the accompanying tables presenting Supplemental Segment Data and reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (non-GAAP measures) to their comparable GAAP financial measures.

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS  

   •    

Selected for Large High-Voltage Electric Transmission Line Project - In January 2022, Quanta was selected by a utility to provide engineering, procurement and construction solutions for a large high-voltage electric transmission project across several states in the western United States. This new project consists of approximately 400 miles of single circuit 500-kilovolt transmission line that is designed to provide increased reliability and improve operational flexibility in conjunction with future generation resources, including renewable energy sources, connect several substations and meet load growth in the utility’s service territory. Engineering and procurement activities for the project have begun, and Quanta will include the project in its Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment first quarter 2022 remaining performance obligations and backlog. Construction on the project is expected to start in the middle of 2022, with completion expected in late 2024.  

   •    

Acquisitions Completed - Subsequent to the company’s third quarter earnings release, during the fourth quarter Quanta acquired four additional businesses for aggregate consideration of approximately $232.6 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. These additional businesses primarily enhance Quanta’s ability to deliver comprehensive infrastructure solutions to our United States utility and communications customers.  

   •    

Named Redgie Probst Chief Operating Officer - In January 2022, Quanta announced that its Board of Directors named Redgie Probst as the company’s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Mr. Probst brings two decades of specialty contracting experience in the electric power infrastructure and other industries as a lineman, entrepreneur and executive, and he previously served as Quanta’s President—Electric Power Division.

Increased Quarterly Cash Dividend by 17% - In December 2021, Quanta’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of $0.07 per share, or a rate of $0.28 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a 17% increase from Quanta’s prior quarterly cash dividend paid in October 2021.  

NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT  

Beginning with the three months ended December 31, 2021, we report our results under three reportable segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions, (2) Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions and (3) Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions. The new Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment represents services performed for renewable energy generation facilities, including wind and solar, as well as services performed for electric transmission, substation, battery storage and related infrastructure that supports the delivery of renewable energy. In conjunction with this change, certain prior period amounts have been recast to conform to this new segment reporting structure.  

RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 AND 2020  

Revenues in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $12.98 billion compared to revenues of $11.20 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020, and net income attributable to common stock was $486.0 million, or $3.34 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income attributable to common stock of $445.6 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2020.

FULL-YEAR 2022 OUTLOOK  

The long-term outlook for Quanta’s business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, project timing, execution challenges and other factors have impacted the company’s historical results, and may impact Quanta’s future financial results. During 2020 and 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of the economy have significantly impacted certain Quanta operations and various markets where Quanta operates, which has created uncertainty. Therefore, Quanta’s financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management’s effort to align these uncertainties with the backlog the company is executing on and the opportunities expected to materialize during 2022.  

Prior to the company’s conference call, management will post a summary of Quanta’s 2022 guidance expectations with additional commentary in the “News and Events” and “Financial Info” areas of the Investor Relations section of Quanta’s website at http://investors.quantaservices.com.  

The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially. For the full year ending December 31, 2022, Quanta expects revenues to range between $16.00 billion and $16.50 billion, net income attributable to common stock to range between $530 million and $604 million, diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to range between $3.56 and $4.06 and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP financial measure) to range between $6.00 and $6.50. For the full year ending December 31, 2022, EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) is expected to range between $1.45 billion and $1.56 billion, and adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) is expected to range between $1.59 billion and $1.70 billion. Additionally, Quanta’s free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) is expected to be between $650 million and $850 million for the year ending December 31, 2022.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The financial measures not prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) that are utilized in this press release are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta’s performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta’s operating results with those of its competitors. These measures should be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures prepared in conformity with GAAP.  

Please see the accompanying tables for reconciliations of the following non-GAAP financial measures for Quanta’s current and historical results and full-year 2022 expectations (as applicable): adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP financial measure) to diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock; adjusted net income attributable to common stock, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP financial measures) to net income attributable to common stock; free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) to net cash provided by operating activities; and backlog (a non-GAAP financial measure) to remaining performance obligations.

Remaining Performance Obligations and Backlog (a non-GAAP financial measure)  

Quanta’s remaining performance obligations represent management’s estimate of consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the remaining portion of firm orders for fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work has not yet begun. For purposes of calculating remaining performance obligations, Quanta includes all estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities, revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to occur and revenues from change orders to the extent management believes additional contract revenues will be earned and are deemed probable of collection.  

While backlog is not a defined term under GAAP, it is a common measurement used in Quanta’s industry. Quanta believes this non-GAAP financial measure enables it and its investors to more effectively forecast its future results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Quanta’s remaining performance obligations, as described above, are a component of Quanta’s backlog calculation, which also includes estimated orders under master service agreements (MSAs), including estimated renewals, and non-fixed price contracts expected to be completed within one year. Quanta’s methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.  

The following table reconciles Quanta’s total remaining performance obligations to its backlog by reportable segment along with estimates of amounts expected to be realized within 12 months:

The following table presents the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net income attributable to common stock to net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These reconciliations are intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock enables it and Quanta’s investors to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. As to certain of the items in the table to follow, (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary from period to period due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary from period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s acquisition activity; (iv) asset impairment charges can vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors; (v) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses and the effect of present value accretion on fair value calculations; (vi) impairments of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates vary from period to period depending on various market factors outside Quanta’s influence or control; (vii) severance and restructuring charges vary from period to period depending on the timing and nature of restructuring activities; (viii) write-offs of deferred financing costs vary from period to period depending on the timing and nature of debt and other financing transactions; (ix) deferred income tax valuation allowance changes vary period to period and depend on Quanta’s assessment of realizability of its deferred tax assets; and (x) income tax contingency releases vary period to period and depend on the level of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the expiration dates under various federal and state statute of limitations periods. Because adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measures, net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included in the table to follow.

The following table presents reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to common stock for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These reconciliations are intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain other items as described below. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net income attributable to common stock enables it and Quanta’s investors to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent when including the excluded items. However, these measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stock or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP.

Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow:  

The following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. This reconciliation is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s ability to generate the cash required to maintain and potentially expand its business. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures is defined as capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and from insurance settlements related to property and equipment. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to Quanta’s investors because free cash flow is viewed by management as an important indicator of how much cash is provided or used by routine business operations, including the impact of net capital expenditures. Management uses this measure for capital allocation purposes as it is viewed as a measure of cash available to fund debt payments, acquire businesses, repurchase common stock, declare and pay dividends and transact other investing and financing activities. However, this measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net cash provided by operating activities, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Also negatively impacting net cash provided by operating activities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $27.9 million and $37.4 million of cash payments for acquisition and integration costs, respectively;  

 (b)  

Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was favorably impacted by the receipt of $82.0 million of insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of two pipeline project claims in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was negatively impacted by approximately $6.9 million and $19.8 million, respectively, of cash payments for acquisition and integration costs. In addition, net cash provided by operating activities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was favorably impacted due to the deferral of $37.0 million and $108.9 million of payments related to the employer portion of payroll taxes pursuant to the CARES Act.
