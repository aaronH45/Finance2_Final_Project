Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. 

On February 14, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), Xilinx, Inc. (the “Company”) completed the previously announced combination with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (“AMD”) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 26, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, AMD and Thrones Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of AMD (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving such Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMD. 

Merger Consideration 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Xilinx Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury shares and any shares of Xilinx Common Stock held directly by AMD or Merger Sub) was converted into the right to receive 1.7234 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AMD (the “AMD Common Stock”) and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to any applicable withholding. 

At the Effective Time, (i) all of the Company restricted stock units (“Xilinx RSUs”) with vesting criteria based on continuing service that were outstanding and held by employees of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time were automatically converted into restricted stock units denominated in shares of AMD Common Stock based on the Exchange Ratio, with Xilinx RSUs with performance-based vesting criteria converted into performance-based vesting restricted stock units denominated in shares of AMD Common Stock based on the Exchange Ratio and continuing to vest through the end of the applicable performance period based on performance measures applicable to such Xilinx RSUs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) all of the Company options held by employees of the Company that were outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (if any) were automatically converted into options to acquire a number of shares of AMD Common Stock determined based on the Exchange Ratio (with the exercise price being adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio) and (iii) all of the Company options and Xilinx RSUs held by non-employee members of the Company’s board of directors accelerated in full and, in the case of Xilinx RSUs, became settled. Aside from the foregoing adjustments, the awards generally remain subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions that applied to the awards immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on October 27, 2020 and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.  

The information contained in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.01. 

On February 14, 2022, the Company notified the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) of the consummation of the Merger and that each outstanding share of Xilinx Common Stock had been converted into the right to receive AMD Common Stock. The Company requested that Nasdaq (i) halt trading of the Xilinx Common Stock on Nasdaq prior to the open of trading on February 14, 2022, (ii) withdraw the Xilinx Common Stock from listing on Nasdaq and (iii) file with the SEC a Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), on Form 25 to report that the Xilinx Common Stock is no longer listed on Nasdaq and to apply for the deregistration of the Xilinx Common Stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. As a result, the shares of Xilinx Common Stock, which previously traded under the symbol “XLNX,” will no longer be listed on Nasdaq. 

In addition, the Company intends to file a certification on Form 15 with the SEC to suspend the Company’s reporting obligations under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
