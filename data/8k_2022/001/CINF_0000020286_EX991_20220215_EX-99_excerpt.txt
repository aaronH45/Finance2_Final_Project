 CINF 4Q21 Release 1

Insurance Operations Highlights

•84.2% fourth-quarter 2021 property casualty combined ratio, improved from 87.3% for the fourth quarter of 2020. Full-year 2021 property casualty combined ratio at 88.3%, with net written premiums up 10%.

•10% growth in fourth-quarter 2021 net written premiums, largely due to price increases and premium growth initiatives.

•$212 million fourth-quarter 2021 property casualty new business written premiums. Agencies appointed since the beginning of 2020 contributed $19 million or 9% of total fourth-quarter new business written premiums. 

•$9 million of fourth-quarter 2021 life insurance subsidiary net income, down $6 million from the same period in 2020, and 8% growth in fourth-quarter 2021 term life insurance earned premiums.

Investment and Balance Sheet Highlights 

•8% or $14 million increase in fourth-quarter 2021 pretax investment income, including 14% growth for stock portfolio dividends and 4% growth in interest income. 

•15% full-year increase in fair value of total investments at December 31, 2021, including a 28% increase for the stock portfolio and a 6% increase for the bond portfolio.

•$5.053 billion parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end 2021, up 34% from a year ago. 

Finishing 2021 Strong

Steven J. Johnston, chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented: “Non-GAAP operating income finished the year strong, increasing 96% to $1.043 billion, compared with year-end 2020. Net income continued its pattern of wide swings as the effects of a robust equity market pushed it to nearly $3 billion at the end of the year, more than double our 2020 result.

“The communities we serve through our insurance business saw a high number of weather-related catastrophes near the end of 2021, including a storm system that left a wide path of destruction across the Midwest in December. While no one likes to witness the pain and destruction these events bring, it is when our field claims representatives shine, delivering support to our policyholders and agents with empathy and warmth. 

“When catastrophes strike, we must have the financial strength to respond quickly and fairly. That desire to be ready to serve those who need us led to our multifaceted approach to refine our pricing precision, including increasing loss control reviews, improving pricing segmentation and adding third-party data sources – enhancing financial strength over time. We believe these long-term initiatives are on the right track as our full-year 2021 combined ratio improved 9.8 points to 88.3% compared with year-end 2020. 

“We continued our record of overall favorable reserve development for a 33rd consecutive year. Net favorable reserve development on prior accident years benefited our fourth-quarter and full-year combined ratios by 6 points and 7 points, respectively.

Recognizing our financial strength, our consistently positive growth and profitability and our strong agency relationships, A.M. Best Co., a leading credit rating agency specializing in the insurance industry, recently affirmed our A+ (Superior) rating. Only the top approximately 12% of insurer groups qualify for Superior ratings from A.M. Best.” 

Focused, Profitable Growth

“Diversification and a firm belief in our underwriting models and expertise are allowing us to grow with confidence. For the first time, full-year property casualty net written premiums exceeded $6 billion. New and renewal business written through independent agencies grew year over year for each of our property casualty insurance segments. For our life insurance segment, earned premiums rose 3%. 

“Our profitable growth is the result of focused execution of our strategic initiatives to enter new product lines and marketing territories and to slowly expand our independent agency force. During the fourth quarter, 2021 net written premiums from our excess and surplus lines operation, launched in 2008, surpassed the $400 million mark. Our initiatives to attract more of our agents' high net worth clients and to grow Cincinnati Re® continued as planned, both increasing property casualty net written premiums.”

Book Value at Record High

“At December 31, our book value again reached a record high, increasing 22% since December 31, 2020, to $81.72. Consolidated cash and total investments reached nearly $26 billion. Our ample capital allows us to execute on our long-term strategies and, at the same time continue to pay dividends to shareholders. Our value creation ratio for 2021, which considers the dividends we pay as well as growth in book value, was 25.7%, ahead of our 10% to 13% average annual target for this measure.”

•0.5 percentage-point decrease in the full-year 2021 underwriting expense ratio, primarily due to ongoing expense management efforts and premium growth outpacing growth in other expenses. 

 CINF 4Q21 Release 3

Commercial Lines Insurance Results[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•10% and 8% growth in fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 commercial lines net written premiums, including price increases, growth initiatives and a higher level of insured exposures.

 CINF 4Q21 Release 4

Personal Lines Insurance Results[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•8% and 6% growth in fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 personal lines net written premiums, largely due to higher renewal written premiums that benefited from rate increases. Full-year 2021 net written premiums from our agencies’ high net worth clients grew 28%, to $663 million.

•11% and 16% increase in fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 new business premiums written by agencies, compared with a year ago, largely reflecting expanded use of pricing precision tools.

 CINF 4Q21 Release 5

Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance Results[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•17% and 22% growth in fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 excess and surplus lines net written premiums, including fourth-quarter 2021 renewal price increases averaging near the low end of the high-single-digit percent range.

•Less than 1% decrease in fourth-quarter 2021 new business written premiums with full-year 2021 increasing 13%, reflecting a highly competitive market with fewer opportunities to write policies with annual premiums of $10,000 or more at pricing levels we believe are adequate and offsetting our additional marketing efforts.

•83.2% fourth-quarter 2021 combined ratio that matched strong operating performance for the year-ago period.

•0.5 percentage-point improvement in the full-year 2021 combined ratio, as lower ratios for underwriting expenses and catastrophe losses offset higher current accident year losses and loss expenses before catastrophes.

Universal life insurance earned premiums can vary, including from changes in interest rate or other actuarial assumptions, and decreased 11% in 2021.

•$12 million or 38% increase in full-year 2021 life insurance subsidiary net income, largely reflecting investment losses resulting from impairments of fixed-maturity securities during the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by less favorable mortality experience in 2021 due largely to higher pandemic-related death claims.

•$25 million or 2% full-year 2021 decrease to $1.392 billion in GAAP shareholders’ equity for The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company, primarily from a decrease in unrealized investment gains partially offset by net income.

◦Inability of our workforce, agencies or vendors to perform necessary business functions

•Ongoing developments concerning business interruption insurance claims and litigation related to the COVID-19 pandemic that affect our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses or our ability to reasonably estimate such losses, such as:

•Increased frequency and/or severity of claims or development of claims that are unforeseen at the time of policy issuance, due to inflationary trends or other causes

•Inadequate estimates or assumptions, or reliance on third-party data used for critical accounting estimates

◦Significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a particular security or group of securities and impairment of the asset(s)

◦Significant decline in investment income due to reduced or eliminated dividend payouts from a particular security or group of securities

◦Significant rise in losses from surety or director and officer policies written for financial institutions or other insured entities

•Our inability to manage Cincinnati Global or other subsidiaries to produce related business opportunities and growth prospects for our ongoing operations

•Inability to obtain adequate ceded reinsurance on acceptable terms, amount of reinsurance coverage purchased, financial strength of reinsurers and the potential for nonpayment or delay in payment by reinsurers

◦Inability or unwillingness to nimbly develop and introduce coverage product updates and innovations that our competitors offer and consumers expect to find in the marketplace

•Our inability, or the inability of our independent agents, to attract and retain personnel in a competitive labor market, impacting the customer experience and altering our competitive advantages

 CINF 4Q21 Release 11

•Events, such as an epidemic, natural catastrophe or terrorism, that could hamper our ability to assemble our workforce at our headquarters location or work effectively in a remote environment

Further, our insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, global, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. We also are subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for our common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures

(See attached tables for reconciliations; additional prior-period reconciliations available at cinfin.com/investors.)

Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules for insurance company regulation in the United States of America as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data. 

Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas – property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP results to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management’s control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis. 

•Non-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding investment gains and losses (defined as investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company’s insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses on fixed-maturity securities sold in any period may be subject to management’s discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses are recognized from certain changes in 

 CINF 4Q21 Release 14

market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period. 

For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information. 

• Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries. That is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and our excess and surplus lines segments plus our reinsurance assumed operations known as Cincinnati Re and our London-based global specialty underwriter known as Cincinnati Global. 

•Life insurance subsidiary results: To supplement life insurance reporting segment disclosures related to our life insurance operation, we also evaluate results for that operation on a basis that includes life insurance subsidiary investment income, or investment income plus investment gains and losses, that are also included in our investments reporting segment. We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products.

Other Measures

•Value creation ratio: This is a measure of shareholder value creation that management believes captures the contribution of the company’s insurance operations, the success of its investment strategy and the importance placed on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio measure is made up of two primary components: (1) rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. Management believes this measure is useful, providing a meaningful measure of long-term progress in creating shareholder value. It is intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, and uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as adoption of Accounting Standards Updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting.

• Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules in the U.S., property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.
