CEO Commentary

“2021 was in many regards a remarkable year for BNY Mellon. We made significant progress towards advancing our strategic priorities and growth agenda, and we delivered solid and improved financial results. Three broad themes really stood out: Our outstanding sales performance and improved broad-based organic growth, the number of innovative products and solutions that we’re bringing to the market across our businesses, and our enhanced effectiveness in delivering the full breadth of Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services, and Investment and Wealth Management with better, more holistic solutions for our clients,” Todd Gibbons, Chief Executive Officer, said.

Mr. Gibbons added, “Full-year EPS of $4.14 was up 8% year-over-year as the benefits of a supportive market backdrop and a benign credit environment together with our meaningfully improved organic growth more than offset the stiff headwind of lower interest rates. Having started 2021 with a significant amount of excess capital combined with our strong capital generation throughout the year allowed us to return $5.7 billion – or 160% of earnings – to our shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases.”

“The pace of innovation across the firm, including in areas such as digital assets, real-time payments, the Future of Collateral and Pershing X – to name just a few – gives me great confidence in our growth prospects. As we look to 2022 and beyond, we expect double-digit EPS growth as we are determined to continue delivering consistent organic growth which, together with the current expectation for higher rates, should allow us to generate positive operating leverage, while at the same time continue investing in the growth and efficiency of our businesses,” Mr. Gibbons concluded.

BNY Mellon 4Q21 Earnings Release

EXPLANATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Release certain Non-GAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to GAAP information, which exclude goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible common equity – Non-GAAP is additional useful information for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income, and the tangible book value per common share – Non-GAAP is additional useful information because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. 

Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis – Non-GAAP and net interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP and other FTE measures include the tax equivalent adjustments on tax-exempt income which allows for the comparison of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating margin for the Investment and Wealth Management business segment, net of distribution and servicing expense that was passed to third parties who distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that this measure is useful when evaluating the performance of the Investment and Wealth Management business segment relative to industry competitors. 

For the reconciliations of these Non-GAAP measures, see “Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in the Financial Supplement available at www.bnymellon.com.

BNY Mellon has presented the measure of fee revenue, excluding money market fee waivers – Non-GAAP. We believe that this measure is useful information for investors for evaluating the impact of current interest rates and market conditions on fee revenue growth rates and the performance of our business.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Expense measures, excluding notable items, including litigation reserves, severance expense and real estate charges are also presented.

Income before tax measures, excluding the notable items mentioned above are provided. These measures are provided to permit investors to view the financial measures on a basis consistent with how management views the businesses.
