ITEM 1.01.ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

On January 31, 2022, American Airlines, Inc. (American), a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group Inc. (the Company), entered into an amendment to that certain Purchase Agreement No. 03735, dated as of February 1, 2013, with The Boeing Company (Boeing), pursuant to which American has agreed to purchase a total of 23 additional 737 MAX 8 aircraft through the conversion of existing purchase options. In addition, American intends to convert a further seven of its purchase options in 2022, bringing its firm order of additional 737 MAX 8 aircraft to 30, with 15 of such aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2023 and 15 scheduled for delivery in 2024.

Additionally, on January 31, 2022, American entered into an amendment to that certain Purchase Agreement No. 3219, dated as of October 15, 2008, with Boeing, pursuant to which American and Boeing agreed to defer the delivery of certain 787-9 aircraft previously scheduled for delivery beginning in January 2023. Pursuant to this amendment, deliveries of these 787-9 aircraft will commence in the fourth quarter of 2023 and will continue into 2027, with four 787-9 aircraft now scheduled for delivery in 2023.

The delivery schedules presented herein represent our best estimates as of the date of this report. Actual delivery dates are subject to change based on various potential factors including production delays by the manufacturer.

ITEM 7.01.REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.

After giving effect to the transactions described in Item 1.01, above, American now expects its full-year 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.669 billion (versus its prior estimate of $2.631 billion) and its full-year 2023 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.860 billion (versus its prior estimate of $2.714 billion), with the change versus prior estimates in each case attributable to the expected increase in net aircraft capital expenditures. 

The information in Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
