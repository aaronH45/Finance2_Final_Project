West Virginia Public Service Commission Issues Order in General Rate Case 

On February 24, 2022, the Public Service Commission of West Virginia (the “PSC”) issued an order approving a request to establish new water and wastewater rates pursuant to a general rate case filed on April 30, 2021 by the West Virginia subsidiary of American Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company”). Under the PSC’s order, the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary has been authorized annualized incremental revenues of $14.8 million, excluding (i) reductions of $1.6 million for excess accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and (ii) $10.2 million for infrastructure surcharges. The new rates are effective as of February 25, 2022, and were based on an authorized return on equity (“ROE”) of 9.80%, compared to an authorized ROE of 9.75% as approved in the subsidiary’s last general rate case effective February 2019. The PSC order also provides for an aggregate authorized rate base of $734.0 million, as well as an authorized capital structure with an equity component of 47.97%. 

A copy of the press release issued by the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary on February 25, 2022 has been filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
