•Full-year revenue of $5.2 billion, up 7% on a reported basis, up 4% organically

•Full-year reported earnings per share of $2.35, up 68%; adjusted earnings per share of $2.49, up 21% 

•Strong demand drives continuing commercial momentum in all business segments; fourth quarter and full-year reported and organic orders growth in excess of 20%

RYE BROOK, N.Y., February 3, 2022 – Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.32 billion, and full-year 2021 revenue of $5.20 billion, in line with previous guidance. 

Fourth quarter adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin decreased 260 basis points to 16.2 percent. Inflation and strategic investments drove the margin decline, exceeding the benefits of price realization and productivity savings. Xylem generated net income of $113 million, or $0.62 per share, and adjusted net income of $115 million, or $0.63 per share, which excludes the impact of restructuring, realignment and special charges.

For the full year, Xylem delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.1 percent, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Productivity and volume drove the increase, exceeding inflation impacts. Full-year reported net income was $427 million, or $2.35 per share, and adjusted net income, which excludes the impact of restructuring, realignment and special charges, was $452 million, or $2.49 per share. The Company generated $538 million of operating cash flow, representing a 126 percent conversion, and $330 million of free cash flow, representing a 77 percent conversion.

“The team closed out 2021 with a strong performance, delivering full-year margin expansion alongside solid growth in revenue and earnings in the face of accelerating supply chain headwinds through the quarter,” said Patrick Decker, president and CEO of Xylem. “To mitigate the effects of inflation, the team also drove solid productivity improvements and price realization above our expectations. Market demand was clearly robust, as evidenced by continued strong orders and backlog growth in both the quarter and the year.”

“We expect the first half of 2022 to continue to be supply constrained due to ongoing chip shortages,” Decker continued. “Order-to-revenue conversion is set to pick up pace progressively, as we expect those constraints to begin easing in the latter part of the year. Overall, we expect full-year growth in the mid-single digits, with significant margin expansion in the second half, keeping us on track to achieve our 2025 growth and strategic milestones.” 

Xylem announced that its Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share, an increase of 7 percent. The dividend is payable on March 17, 2022, to shareholders of record as of February 17, 2022.

Full-year 2022 Outlook

Xylem forecasts full-year 2022 revenue in the range of $5.25 to $5.35 billion, up 1 to 3 percent on a reported basis and up 3 to 5 percent on an organic basis.

Full-year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 16 to 17 percent. This results in adjusted earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.70, which represents a decline of 6 percent to an increase of 8 percent from Xylem’s 2021 adjusted results. Further 2022 planning assumptions are included in Xylem’s fourth quarter 2021 earnings materials posted at www.xylem.com/investors. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort.

Fourth Quarter Segment Results

Water Infrastructure

Xylem’s Water Infrastructure segment consists of its portfolio of businesses serving clean water delivery, wastewater transport and treatment, and dewatering.

•Fourth quarter 2021 revenue was $622 million, a 2 percent increase compared with fourth quarter 2020. This result was driven by healthy growth in the industrial end market, particularly in the Emerging Markets, partially offset by delayed revenue conversion in the U.S. utilities market primarily due to extended lead-times for ocean transit.

•Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.7 percent, down 50 basis points from the prior year. Reported operating income for the segment was $122 million. Adjusted operating income for the segment, which excludes $2 million of restructuring and realignment, was $124 million, flat versus the comparable period last year. Reported operating margin for the segment was 19.6 percent, up 60 basis points versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 19.9 percent, down 20 basis points versus prior year. Productivity benefits and price realization were more than offset by inflation and investments.

Applied Water

Xylem’s Applied Water segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in residential and commercial building services, and industrial applications.

•Fourth quarter 2021 Applied Water revenue was $406 million, a 3 percent increase organically year-over-year. Industrial end-market strength in Emerging Markets, US and Western Europe was partially offset by weakness in the residential market in China particularly in light of strong prior-year performance.

•Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.8 percent, down 340 basis points from the prior year. Reported operating income for the segment was $50 million and adjusted operating income, which excludes $2 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $52 million, a 16 percent decrease versus the comparable period last year. The segment reported operating margin was 12.3 percent, down 310 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin declined 290 basis points to 12.8 percent. Productivity benefits and price realization were more than offset by inflation. 

Measurement & Control Solutions

Xylem’s Measurement & Control Solutions segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in smart metering, network technologies, advanced infrastructure analytics and analytic instrumentation.

•Fourth quarter 2021 Measurement & Control Solutions revenue was $295 million, down 17 percent organically versus the prior year. The decline is in-line with our expectations and a result of the ongoing chip supply shortage and the outsized impact to our North American smart metering business.

•Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.1 percent, down 750 basis points from the prior year. Reported operating income for the segment was -$17 million, and adjusted operating income, which excludes $2 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was -$15 million, a 194 percent decrease versus the comparable period last year. The Measurement & Control Solutions segment reported operating margin was -5.8 percent, down 970 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin of -5.1 percent also decreased 950 basis points over the prior year period. Volume declines from component shortages as well as inflation more than offset productivity savings and modest price realization.

Xylem Inc. Non-GAAP Measures

Management reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or “adjusted”) measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following items to represent the non-GAAP measures we consider to be key performance indicators, as well as the related reconciling items to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

“Organic revenue” and “Organic orders” defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales or discontinuance of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency translation impacts is determined by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate.

“Constant currency” defined as financial results adjusted for foreign currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

“EBITDA” defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Adjusted Segment EBITDA” reflects the adjustments to EBITDA and segment EBITDA, respectively, to exclude share-based compensation charges, restructuring and realignment costs, gain or loss from sale of businesses and special charges.

“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” and “Adjusted Segment EBITDA margin” defined as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted segment EBITDA divided by total revenue and segment revenue, respectively.

“Adjusted Operating Income”, “Adjusted Segment Operating Income”, “Adjusted Net Income” and “Adjusted EPS” defined as operating income, segment operating income, net income and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude restructuring and realignment costs, gain or loss from sale of businesses, special charges and tax-related special items, as applicable.

“Adjusted Operating Margin” and “Adjusted Segment Operating Margin” defined as adjusted operating income and adjusted segment operating income divided by total revenue and segment revenue, respectively.

“Free Cash Flow” defined as net cash from operating activities, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flows, less capital expenditures, and “Free Cash Flow Conversion” defined as Free Cash Flows divided by net income, excluding the gain on sale of businesses, non-cash impairment charges and significant deferred tax items. Our definitions of “free cash flow” and “free cash flow conversion” do not consider certain non-discretionary cash payments, such as debt.

“Realignment costs” defined as costs not included in restructuring costs that are incurred as part of actions taken to reposition our business, including items such as professional fees, severance, relocation, travel, facility set-up and other costs.

“Special charges” defined as costs incurred by the Company, such as acquisition and integration related costs, non-cash impairment charges and both operating and non-operating adjustments for costs related to the UK pension plan buyout.

“Tax-related special items” defined as tax items, such as tax return versus tax provision adjustments, tax exam impacts, tax law change impacts, excess tax benefits/losses and other discrete tax adjustments.
