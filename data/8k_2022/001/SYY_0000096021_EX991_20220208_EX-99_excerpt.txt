SYSCO SECOND QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDE MEANINGFUL MARKET SHARE GAINS &  

PROGRESS WITH RECIPE FOR GROWTH STRATEGY  

HOUSTON, February 8, 2022 - Sysco Corporation (NYSE: SYY) today announced financial results for its 13-week second fiscal quarter ended January 1, 2022.  

Key highlights for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022:  

   •    

Second quarter sales increased 41.2% versus the same period in fiscal year 2021 and increased 10.5% versus the same period in fiscal year 2019, with meaningful market share gains;  

   •    

Product inflation effectively managed, despite the dynamic supply chain environment;  

   •    

Gross profit per case increased across all segments;  

   •    

Profitability impacted by temporary Omicron and labor cost increases during the quarter;  

   •    

$650 million returned to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends; and  

   •    

Investments and enhanced capabilities advance with Sysco’s Recipe for Growth strategy.  

“Sysco’s results this quarter were fueled by another quarter of exceptional market share gains, as our relative supply chain strength and Recipe For Growth strategy have enabled us to win in the marketplace. We continue to prioritize both top-line growth and profitability improvement, while efficiently managing elevated inflation. Bottom-line results for the quarter were below our expectations due to higher than anticipated operating expenses, driven by the current COVID environment. The Omicron variant is currently impacting our customers, affecting their top-line and hours of operations. At Sysco, the COVID impact is felt in our operations productivity performance with higher than normal cost to serve. Given current economic conditions, we are managing the macro environment well,” said Kevin Hourican, Sysco’s president and chief executive officer. “I want to thank all of our Sysco associates for their persistence and tenacity in supporting our customers and advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy.”  

Key financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 included:  

   •

   •    

Gross profit increased 37.8% to $2.9 billion, as compared to the same period last year, and increased 4.3%, as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2019;  

   •    

Operating income increased 109.8% to $444.9 million, and adjusted1 operating income increased to $495.7 million, as compared to the same period last year, while operating income decreased 1.5% and adjusted1 operating income decreased 17.8%, as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2019;

“Our financial results this quarter reflect strong sales growth and increased profitability, notwithstanding double-digit inflation, near-term productivity challenges arising from workforce transition and our purposeful snap back and transformation investments. As part of our balanced capital allocation priorities, we also repurchased $416 million in shares of Sysco common stock and successfully refinanced approximately $1.25 billion of debt at longer maturities and more attractive rates,” said Aaron Alt, Sysco’s chief financial officer.  

Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Results  

Total Sysco  

Sales for the second quarter were $16.3 billion, an increase of 41.2% compared to the same period last year. The exit rate for the second quarter continued to grow compared to the same period in fiscal year 2021, but decelerated in December due to disruptions from the Omicron variant.  

Gross profit increased 37.8% to $2.9 billion, and gross margin decreased 44 basis points to 17.7%, compared in each case to the same period last year. The increase in gross profit for the second quarter was primarily driven by higher volumes and high rates of inflation that were effectively managed.  

Operating expenses increased $559.8 million, or 29.7%, compared to the same period last year, driven by increased volumes, one-time expenses associated with the snap-back, and investments against our transformational initiatives. Adjusted operating expenses increased $531.1 million, or 28.5%, compared to the same period last year.  

Operating income was $444.9 million, an increase of $232.8 million, or 109.8%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating income was $495.7 million, an increase of $261.6 million compared to the same period last year.

Operating expenses increased $101.4 million, or 22.3%, compared to the same period last year.

Foreign exchange rates increased International Foodservice Operations operating expense by 0.7% and total Sysco operating expense by 0.2% during the quarter.

Forward-Looking Statements  

Statements made in this press release or in our earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 that look forward in time or that express management’s beliefs, expectations or hopes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements reflect the views of management at the time such statements are made and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These statements include statements concerning: the effect, impact, potential duration or other implications of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and any expectations we may have with respect thereto, including the extent and duration of lockdowns in the U.S. and Europe; our expectations regarding the impact of the Omicron variant on operating results and our expectations regarding our ability to return to our growth pattern of improved sales and volume performance as the Omicron variant recedes; our expectations regarding the pace and timing of the business recovery in the U.S. and Europe; our expectations that our transformational agenda will drive long-term growth; our expectations regarding the continuation of an inflationary environment; our belief that incremental expenses within our supply chain, driven by labor costs, will improve over time; our expectations regarding the impact of our Recipe for Growth strategy and our belief that this strategy will uniquely position Sysco to win in the marketplace for the long-term; our expectations regarding Sysco’s ability to outperform the market in future periods; our expectations that our strategic priorities will enable us to grow faster than the market; our expectations regarding our efforts to reduce overtime rates and the incremental investments in hiring; our expectations regarding our ability to move our newer associates up the productivity curve over time; our belief that our approach to ensure we can ship on-time and in full will benefit our relationship with our customers for the long-term and positively impact retention and growth; our expectations regarding the impact of our growth initiatives and their ability to enable Sysco to consistently outperform the market; our expectations regarding the impact of the Greco and Sons acquisition on our business; our expectations regarding our ability to grow faster than the total market in fiscal 2022 and to exceed our growth target for fiscal 2022; our expectations regarding the expansion of our Sysco Your Way initiative; our expectations regarding labor costs in the fiscal third quarter; our ability to deliver against our strategic priorities; economic trends in the United States and abroad; our plans to make continued capital investments over the next three fiscal years in our technology, fleet and buildings; our expectations regarding our dividend payments in calendar year 2022 and in future periods; our future growth; our expectations regarding profits and sales in fiscal 2022; the pace of implementation of our business transformation initiatives; our expectations regarding our adjusted earnings per share growth in fiscal 2024; our expectations regarding our earnings per share in fiscal 2022; our expectations regarding our performance in the fiscal third and fourth quarters; our plans to improve associate retention, training and productivity; our belief that our Recipe for Growth transformation is creating capabilities that will help us profitably grow for the long term; our belief in our ability to grow our share profitably and to become more efficient; and our expectations regarding the decline of snap-back costs in the fiscal third quarter.  

The success of our plans and expectations regarding our operating performance are subject to the general risks associated with our business, including the risks of interruption of supplies due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, crop conditions, work stoppages, intense competition, technology disruptions, dependence on large, long-term regional and national customers, inflation risks, the impact of fuel prices, adverse publicity, labor issues, political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, any or all of which could delay our receipt of product or increase our input costs. Risks and uncertainties also include the impact and effects of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the adverse impact thereof on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited to, our growth, product costs, supply chain, labor availability, logistical capabilities, customer demand for our products and industry demand generally, consumer spending, our liquidity, the price of our securities and trading markets with respect thereto, our credit ratings, our ability to maintain compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement, our ability to access capital markets, and the global economy and financial markets generally. Risks and uncertainties also include risks impacting the economy generally, including the risks that the current general economic conditions will deteriorate, or consumer confidence in the economy or consumer spending, particularly on food-away-from-home, may decline. Market conditions may not improve. Competition and the impact of GPOs may reduce our margins and make it difficult for us to maintain our market share, growth rate and profitability. We may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs, and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs. Our ability to meet our long-term strategic objectives depends on our ability to grow gross profit, leverage our supply chain costs and reduce administrative costs. This will depend largely on the success of our various business initiatives, including efforts related to revenue management, expense management, our digital e-commerce strategy and any efforts related to restructuring or the reduction of administrative costs. There are various risks related to these efforts, including the risk that if sales from our locally managed customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from regional and national customers, or if we are unable to continue to accelerate local case growth, our gross margins may decline; the risk that we are unlikely to be able to predict inflation over the long term, and lower inflation is likely to produce lower gross profit; the risk that our efforts to mitigate increases in warehouse costs may be unsuccessful; the risk that we may not be able to accelerate and/or identify additional administrative cost savings in order to compensate for any gross profit or supply chain cost leverage challenges; the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame, if at all, and may prove costlier than expected; the risk that the actual costs of any initiatives may be greater or less than currently expected; and the risk of adverse effects to our business, results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings, and the associated changes to our business, do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate. Our plans related to and the timing of any initiatives are subject to change at any time based on management’s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts, we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease. Adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings. Capital expenditures may vary based on changes in business plans and other factors, including risks related to the implementation of various initiatives, the timing and successful completion of acquisitions, construction schedules and the possibility that other cash requirements could result in delays or cancellations of capital spending. Periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation, either overall or in certain product categories, can have a negative impact on us and our customers, as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food-away-from-home market, and may negatively impact our sales, gross profit, operating income and earnings, and periods of deflation can be difficult to manage effectively. Fluctuations in inflation and deflation, as well as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, are beyond our control and subject to broader market forces. Expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and risks, including compliance with local laws, regulations and customs and the impact of local political and economic conditions, including the impact of Brexit and the “yellow vest” protests in France against a fuel tax increase, pension reform and the French government, and such expansion efforts may not be successful. Any business that we acquire may not perform as expected, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. Expectations regarding the financial statement impact of any acquisitions may change based on management’s subjective evaluation. A divestiture of one or more of our businesses may not provide the anticipated effects on our operations. Meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings, available cash and the success of our various strategic initiatives. Changes in applicable tax laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. We rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident, other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers. For a discussion of additional factors impacting Sysco’s business, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 3, 2021, as filed with the SEC, and our subsequent filings with the SEC. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.

Non-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)  

Impact of Certain Items  

Our discussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than free cash flow, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove the impact of restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (1) restructuring charges, (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives and (3) facility closure and severance charges; acquisition-related costs consisting of: (1) intangible amortization expense and (2) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions; and the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the collectability of our pre-pandemic trade receivable balances. Our results for fiscal 2022 were also impacted by debt extinguishment costs and the increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions. Our results for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2021 were also impacted by a loss on the sale of a business.  

The results of our foreign operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our total Sysco and our International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis. Constant currency operating results are calculated by translating current-period local currency operating results with the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.  

Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items and presenting its International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis.  

Sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions and excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, acquisition costs and due-diligence costs for those acquisitions. We believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of Sysco’s results for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.  

Set forth below is a reconciliation of sales, operating expenses, operating income, other (income) expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented. Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add up to the total presented due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.

Free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment and includes proceeds from sales of plant and equipment. Sysco considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. However, free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. Free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. In the table that follows, free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities.

Non-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)  

Impact of Certain Items on Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)  

(Dollars in Thousands)  

EBITDA represents net earnings (loss) plus (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense and benefit, (iii) depreciation and (iv) amortization. The net earnings (loss) component of our EBITDA calculation is impacted by Certain Items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance. As a result, in the non-GAAP reconciliations below for each period presented, adjusted EBITDA is computed as EBITDA plus the impact of Certain Items, excluding Certain items related to interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Sysco’s management considers growth in this metric to be a measure of overall financial performance that provides useful information to management and investors about the profitability of the business, as it facilitates comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business. Additionally, it is a commonly used component metric used to inform on capital structure decisions. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure in assessing the company’s financial performance for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. In the tables that follow, adjusted EBITDA for each period presented is reconciled to net earnings.
