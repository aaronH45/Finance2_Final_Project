Item 8.01 Other Events  

Morgan Stanley (the “Firm”) today announced that the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Firm’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) has determined in consultation with the Firm’s Board of Directors the 2021 compensation for James P. Gorman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Firm. 

The Compensation Committee based its decision on its assessment of Mr. Gorman’s outstanding individual performance and record Firm financial performance, including meeting or exceeding its two-year objectives announced in January of 2021, and executing on the next phase of transformational growth and shareholder value. 

Under Mr. Gorman’s leadership, for 2021: 

 ‒The Firm achieved record financial performance in terms of revenues, profits before tax and earnings per share. Firm net revenues were approximately $60 billion with net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of approximately $15 billion, and earnings per share was $8.03. 

 ‒The Firm also reported full year ROTCE of 19.8%, efficiency ratio of 67%, and Wealth Management pre-tax margin of 25.5%, or 26.9% excluding integration expenses, in each case meeting or exceeding the Firm’s two-year objectives. 

 ‒The market recognized the Firm’s continuing transformation and growth, as reflected in strong relative performance in total shareholder return versus peers in 2021 and top performance over 3- & 5-year periods. During 2021, the Morgan Stanley share price increased by 43% from $68.53 to $98.16 – a significant increase in stock price and a premium valuation to peers – adding ~$50 billion in market value to end the year at $174 billion. 

 ‒The Firm continued to increase returns to shareholders. The quarterly dividend was doubled to $0.70, with total dividends paid of $3.8 billion, and the Firm repurchased $11 billion in shares, up from $1 billion in 2020. 

 ‒The Firm continued to press the advantage of its strategic transformation to drive significant growth: 

 oInstitutional Securities continued to increase its pre-tax margin and wallet share in each of its businesses, and revenues were a record $30 billion, with strong revenues across Advisory, Underwriting, and Equity, notwithstanding losses related to a single client event in the first quarter. 

 oWealth Management had leading businesses in each of its channels with nearly 15 million unique client relationships, $438 billion of net new assets and $4.9 trillion of total client assets, and $346 billion of deposits, each a significant increase from prior years. 

 oInvestment Management reported full year net revenues above $6 billion driven by strong asset management revenues on record assets under management of $1.6 trillion and $114.5 billion of net flows. 

 oThe Firm continued to successfully integrate its E*TRADE and Eaton Vance acquisitions, which have significantly increased the scale and breadth of the Firm’s Wealth and Investment Management franchises as combined client assets now stand at $6.5 trillion. 

 ‒The Firm continued to focus on the health and wellbeing of its employees with enhancements to employee wellness offerings, including enhanced parental leave policies, paid leave benefits for family care, and financial wellness programs through MS at Work. 

 ‒The Firm continued its commitment to diversity and inclusion. In conjunction with the Institute for Inclusion, chaired by Mr. Gorman, the Firm drove workforce diversity, invested in underserved communities, enhanced engagement with diverse-led businesses, and supported diverse communities where employees live and work. The Firm also supported a number of organizations driving racial equity, including a $20 million investment to create more accessible pathways to college and career success for students from low-income backgrounds. Through targeted professional development and recruiting programs, the Firm developed and recruited diverse talent. The Firm also introduced representation objectives to drive greater accountability for a diverse workforce. 

The Compensation Committee set Mr. Gorman’s total compensation for 2021 at $35 million, an increase from $33 million for 2020. Mr. Gorman’s 2021 compensation is comprised of four parts: a base salary of $1.5 million; a cash bonus of $8.375 million; a deferred equity award of $5.025 million; and a performance-vested equity award of $20.1 million that converts to shares only if the Firm meets predetermined performance goals with respect to (a) average Firm return on tangible common equity and (b) relative total shareholder return over the three-year performance period. The Compensation Committee increased the return on tangible common equity goal of the performance-vested equity award from 15% to 16% to earn a maximum payout of 1.5 times this portion of the award, reflecting the transformative changes to the business last year. 

Consistent with previous years, 75% of Mr. Gorman’s incentive compensation is deferred over three years and is subject to cancellation, and 100% of Mr. Gorman’s deferred incentive compensation is delivered in the form of equity awards, aligning his compensation with shareholders’ interests. For 2021, the portion of Mr. Gorman’s bonus delivered in performance-vested equity was increased to 60%. 

Additional important information about the Registrant’s incentive compensation programs and governance, including an explanation of all material elements of the compensation for Mr. Gorman and the other named executive officers, will be presented in the Registrant’s proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2022.
