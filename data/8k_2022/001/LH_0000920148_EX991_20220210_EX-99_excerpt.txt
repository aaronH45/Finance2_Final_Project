“Labcorp’s ability to harness science, innovation and technology helped us advance our strategy, effectively respond to the global pandemic, and drive meaningful financial performance throughout 2021,” said Adam Schechter, chairman and CEO of Labcorp. “We experienced Base Business growth of 8.2% in the fourth quarter and 19.4% in 2021. This provides significant momentum and sets the stage for continued Base Business growth in 2022 and beyond.”

In the fourth quarter and throughout the year, Labcorp made important contributions to the ongoing pandemic response while growing its core business.

The company furthered its efforts to advance cancer testing and the development of innovative treatments, including through the pending acquisition of Personal Genome Diagnostics, a leading provider of comprehensive liquid biopsy and tissue-based genomic products and services. Labcorp expanded on its solid record of pursuing high-growth opportunities and leveraging its unique diagnostics and drug development capabilities. By entering into a long-term relationship with Ascension, one of the nation’s largest health systems, the company expects to broaden access to its clinical laboratory services in 10 states. Labcorp will also acquire select assets of the health system’s outreach laboratory. The company expects first year annualized revenues to be between $550 million and $600 million. The transaction is expected to be accretive to the company’s earnings in year one and return its cost of capital by year two.

In December, Labcorp announced several actions to further enhance shareholder value following the conclusion of the company’s previously announced, comprehensive review of its structure and capital allocation strategy. The actions include the initiation of a dividend in the second quarter of 2022, the authorization of a $2.5 billion share repurchase program, of which $1.0 billion is being repurchased through an accelerated plan, and the implementation of a new LaunchPad business process improvement initiative that targets $350 million in savings over the next three years. The Board also unanimously concluded that the company’s existing structure is in the best interest of shareholders at this time. The Labcorp management team and Board are committed to continuing to evaluate all avenues for enhancing shareholder value.

Consolidated Results

Fourth Quarter Results

Revenue for the quarter was $4.06 billion, a decrease of (9.7%) from $4.49 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease was due to organic revenue of (10.3%) and divestitures of (0.1%), partially offset by acquisitions of 0.6% and foreign currency translation of 0.1%. The (10.3%) decline in organic revenue was driven by a (15.3%) decrease in COVID-19 PCR and antibody testing (COVID-19 Testing), partially offset by a 5.0% increase in the company's organic Base Business. Base Business includes Labcorp's operations except for COVID-19 Testing.

Operating income for the quarter was $730.6 million, or 18.0% of revenue, compared to $1,293.2 million, or 28.8%, in the fourth quarter of 2020. The company recorded amortization, restructuring charges, and special items, which together totaled $171.5 million in the quarter, compared to $136.3 million during the same period in 2020. Adjusted operating income (excluding amortization, restructuring charges, and special items) for the quarter was $902.2 million, or 22.2% of revenue, compared to $1,429.5 million, or 31.8%, in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID-19 Testing. 

Net earnings for the quarter were $553.0 million compared to $938.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Diluted EPS were $5.75 in the quarter compared to $9.54 during the same period in 2020.

Operating cash flow for the quarter was $697.5 million compared to $774.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, partially offset by favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $150.0 million compared to $99.4 million a year ago. As a result, free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) was $547.5 million compared to $675.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

At the end of the quarter, the company’s cash balance and total debt were $1.5 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and an identification of the components that comprise "special items" used for certain adjusted financial information are included in the tables accompanying this press release.
