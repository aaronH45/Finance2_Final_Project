On February 15, 2022, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Omnicom Group Inc. (the “Company”) voted to increase the size of the Board from nine persons to eleven persons and to elect Patricia Salas Pineda and Mark D. Gerstein as new directors to fill the vacancies created by such increase, effective immediately for Ms. Pineda and effective on May 1, 2022 for Mr. Gerstein. Each of them will hold office as a director on the Board until the Company’s next annual meeting of shareholders and until a successor is elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. Ms. Pineda was appointed to serve on the Governance Committee of the Board and Mr. Gerstein was appointed to serve, effective May 1, 2022, on the Finance Committee of the Board. 

Neither Ms. Pineda nor Mr. Gerstein has a direct or indirect interest in any transaction with the Company that would qualify as a related party transaction under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. There is no arrangement or understanding between either of them and any other person pursuant to which either was selected as a director. 

Ms. Pineda and Mr. Gerstein will each receive compensation for their service on the Board in accordance with the Company’s standard compensatory arrangement for non-employee directors. A description of the Company’s non-employee director compensation can be found under the caption “Directors’ Compensation for Fiscal Year 2020” in the Company’s Notice of 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2021. The compensation for each of them for service as a non-employee director will be prorated to reflect the time each serves on the Board during 2022. 

A copy of the press release issued by the Company on February 22, 2022, which announces the election of Ms. Pineda and Mr. Gerstein to the Board, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
