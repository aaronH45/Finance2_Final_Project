Provision for Credit Losses  

Full Year       

Provision for credit losses was $357 million for 2021, compared with $3.10 billion for 2020. 2021 included provisions related to portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards, including provisions related to the pending acquisition of the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio), largely offset by reserve reductions on wholesale and consumer loans reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment. This followed challenging conditions in the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to significant provisions in 2020.

Represents a preliminary estimate for the fourth quarter of 2021 and may be revised in the firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.    

   5.  

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the firm early adopted the Standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). As of December 31, 2021, the impact of this was an increase of approximately $15 billion to risk-weighted assets.    

   6.  

In the third quarter of 2021, based on regulatory feedback, the firm revised certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the calculation of Standardized risk-weighted assets. As of December 31, 2020, this change would have increased risk-weighted assets by approximately $23 billion to $577 billion, which would have reduced the firm’s Standardized Common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 14.7% by 0.6 percentage points.
