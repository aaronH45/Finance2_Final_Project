Effective February 2, 2022, based on the unanimous recommendation of the Executive Development and Compensation Committee and the unanimous approval of the independent members of the Board, the Company and Mr. Lynch executed a Separation Agreement and General Release, providing for, among other things, payment to Mr. Lynch for 12 months of his current annual base salary of $1,000,000, minus applicable deductions and withholdings, in accordance with the Company’s regular pay schedule in consideration for a 12-month concurrent non-compete and non-solicitation period, a general release of claims, and other restrictive covenants. Mr. Lynch’s retirement from the Board was not as a result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.

On February 1, 2022, the Chairman of the Board and the Company received notice from Lloyd M.
