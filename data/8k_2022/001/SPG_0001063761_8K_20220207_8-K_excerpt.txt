 Item 2.02.Results of Operations and Financial Condition 

On February 7, 2022, Simon Property Group, Inc. issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 and other matters. A copy of the press release is furnished with this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference into this report. 

 Item 7.01.Regulation FD Disclosure 

Exhibit 99.1 also includes supplemental financial and operating information for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. 

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits 

Financial Statements: 

None 

Exhibits: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The exhibit filed with this report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States, including funds from operations (“FFO”), FFO per share, funds available for distribution, net operating income (“NOI”), domestic property NOI and portfolio NOI. FFO and NOI are performance measures that are standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO and NOI provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with the performance of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs. 

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities. 

Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most-directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the exhibit. 

The information in this report and the exhibit filed herewith is being furnished, not filed, for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and pursuant to Items 2.02 and 7.01 of Form 8-K, will not be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
