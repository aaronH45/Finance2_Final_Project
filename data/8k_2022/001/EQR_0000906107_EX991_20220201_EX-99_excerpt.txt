Equity Residential Reports Full Year 2021 Results and Provides Full Year 2022 Guidance 

2022 Guidance Reflects Acceleration in Growth 

Chicago, IL – February 1, 2022 - Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021. All per share results are reported as available to common shares/units on a diluted basis. For the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company reported earnings per share (EPS), Funds from Operations (FFO) per share and Normalized FFO per share of $1.40, $0.76 and $0.82, respectively. For the full year of 2021, the Company reported EPS, FFO per share and Normalized FFO per share of $3.54, $2.96 and $2.99, respectively. 

“Robust demand in the fourth quarter drove high occupancy and the lowest resident Turnover in our history, allowing us to continue to increase rents. We expect operations and cash flows in 2022 to accelerate further as we write new leases at significantly higher current market rent levels and benefit from continuing deep demand. Our target affluent renter demographic remains drawn to the attractive lifestyle that our high quality urban and suburban properties and dedicated property teams provide,” said Mark J. Parrell, Equity Residential’s President and CEO. “Our capital allocation plan remains solidly on track as we actively buy and build in our expansion markets and the more desirable suburbs of our established markets where increasing numbers of affluent renters wish to live, work and play.” 

Recent Highlights 

•  

Healthy demand (and in the case of EPS, higher property sale gains) drove a 105.9% increase in EPS, 4.1% increase in FFO per share and 7.9% increase in Normalized FFO per share during the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020. 

•  

The Company reported a 4.9% increase in same store revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020, driven by strong Physical Occupancy, a substantial improvement in pricing power and an increase in Non-Residential revenues. 

•  

The Company reported a 3.0% increase in same store expenses for the full year of 2021, reflecting the Company’s continued success in managing controllable expenses and modest growth in real estate taxes. 

•  

The Company reported same store Turnover of 9.4% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 44.4% for the full year of 2021, both the lowest in the Company’s history, demonstrating the depth of demand from its residents. 

•  

The Company provided full year 2022 operating guidance that anticipates a 19.5%, 15.2%, and 15.4% increase in EPS, FFO per share and Normalized FFO per share, respectively, driven by expected total same store revenue growth of 9.0% at the midpoint (and in the case of EPS, higher expected property sale gains).  

•  

The Company continued to successfully execute on its capital allocation strategy during the fourth quarter of 2021 with the acquisition of six operating properties in its expansion markets for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $689.0 million and the disposition of four operating properties in its California and Washington, D.C. markets for an aggregate sale price of approximately $695.0 million. During the full year of 2021, the Company acquired 17 operating properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion and sold 14 operating properties for an aggregate sale price of approximately $1.7 billion.  

•  

The Company was named the Gold Nareit 2021 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion award recipient in recognition of the Company’s demonstration of a strong commitment to the advancement of diversity and inclusion both within the Company and in the REIT and publicly traded real estate industry. 

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results  

The change in EPS for both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020 is due primarily to higher property sale gains in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021, the various adjustment items listed on page 26 of this release and the items described below. 

The per share change in FFO for both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020 is due primarily to the various adjustment items listed on page 26 of this release and the items described below.

Investment Activity and Portfolio Strategy 

The Company continues to optimize its portfolio by allocating capital to desirable suburban locations within its established markets and through expansion into certain new markets that attract a renter demographic that values our exceptional product offering. In support of this strategy, the Company acquired six properties, consisting of 1,826 apartment units, during the fourth quarter of 2021 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $689.0 million and a weighted average Acquisition Cap Rate of 3.7%. These properties are located in Austin, TX, Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX (2), Atlanta, GA, and Denver, CO (2). For the full year of 2021, the Company acquired 17 properties, consisting of 4,747 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion and a weighted average Acquisition Cap Rate of 3.8%.  The average age of the properties acquired in 2021 was two years. Approximately $1.4 billion, or 82.0% of all acquisition activity in 2021, was in expansion markets. 

The Company funded these acquisitions by selling older assets located within established markets that no longer met our long-term investment criteria. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company sold four properties consisting of 1,211 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $695.0 million and a weighted average Disposition Yield of 3.6%, generating an Unlevered IRR of 12.1%. Two of the properties are located in suburban San Francisco, CA, one in suburban Los Angeles, CA and one in suburban Washington, D.C. During the full year of 2021, the Company sold 14 properties, consisting of 3,053 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $1.7 billion and a weighted average Disposition Yield of 3.7%, generating an Unlevered IRR of 10.4%. The average age of the properties sold in 2021 was approximately 30 years. 

Finally, the Company remains active in development, both directly and through its joint venture partners. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed the construction of Alcott, a 470-unit wholly owned apartment property in the urban center of Boston, MA for a total development cost of approximately $409.7 million and an expected stabilized Development Yield of 5.6%. Also during the fourth quarter, the Company entered into four unconsolidated joint ventures for the purpose of developing vacant land parcels into approximately 1,275 apartment units in Texas and Colorado. Three of the projects are related to the Company’s joint venture development program with Toll Brothers, Inc. During the full year of 2021, the Company completed three development projects, consisting of 824 apartment units, for a total cost of approximately $602.8 million and started four development projects, consisting of 1,241 apartment units, for a total anticipated cost of approximately $452.7 million.

The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes were primarily driven by the following factors: 

Real estate taxes – Increase due to modest rate growth, partially offset by reduced assessed values in certain locations. 

On-site payroll – Improved sales and service staff utilization from various technology initiatives and higher than usual staffing vacancies during the current periods. 

Utilities – Water, sewer and trash charges (approximately 65% of total) increased due to both usage and rate. Natural gas and electric charges (approximately 35% of total) increased due to higher commodity prices. 

Repairs and maintenance – Quarter-over-quarter decrease due primarily to significantly lower resident turnover than in the prior year. Year-over-year increase primarily driven by low comparable period expense growth due to the pandemic along with increases in minimum wage on contract services and maintenance repairs in 2021. 

Insurance – Increase due to higher premiums on property insurance renewal due to challenging conditions in the insurance market. 

Leasing and advertising – Year-over-year increase primarily driven by increased digital advertising. 

Other on-site operating expenses – Increase driven by higher ground lease-related expenses.

Additional Reconciliations and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms 

(Amounts in thousands except per share and per apartment unit data) 

(All per share data is diluted)   

This Earnings Release and Supplemental Financial Information includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and other terms that management believes are helpful in understanding our business. The definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP financial measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other real estate investment trusts (“REIT”) and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other measurement of performance computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) or as an alternative to cash flows from specific operating, investing or financing activities. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a measure of cash flow or liquidity. 

Acquisition Capitalization Rate or Cap Rate – NOI that the Company anticipates receiving in the next 12 months (or the year two or three stabilized NOI for properties that are in lease-up at acquisition) less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $100-$450 per apartment unit depending on the age and condition of the asset) divided by the gross purchase price of the asset. The weighted average Acquisition Cap Rate for acquired properties is weighted based on the projected NOI streams and the relative purchase price for each respective property. 

Average Rental Rate – Total Residential rental revenues reflected on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP divided by the weighted average occupied apartment units for the reporting period presented.

The interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread (currently 0.775%), or based on bids received from the lending group, and an annual facility fee (currently 0.125%). Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the Company’s senior unsecured credit rating. In addition, the Company limits its utilization of the facility in order to maintain liquidity to support its $1.0 billion commercial paper program along with certain other obligations. The following table presents the availability on the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facility:

Development Yield – NOI that the Company anticipates receiving in the next 12 months following stabilization less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $50-$150 per apartment unit depending on the type of asset) divided by the Total Budgeted Capital Cost of the asset. The weighted average Development Yield for development properties is weighted based on the projected NOI streams and the relative Total Budgeted Capital Cost for each respective property. 

Disposition Yield – NOI that the Company anticipates giving up in the next 12 months less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $100-$450 per apartment unit depending on the age and condition of the asset) divided by the gross sales price of the asset. The weighted average Disposition Yield for sold properties is weighted based on the projected NOI streams and the relative sales price for each respective property. 

Earnings Per Share ("EPS") – Net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. 

EBITDA for Real Estate and Normalized EBITDA for Real Estate: 

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (“EBITDAre”) – The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines EBITDAre (September 2017 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and further adjusted for gains and losses from sales of depreciated operating properties, impairment write-downs of depreciated operating properties, impairment write-downs of investments in unconsolidated entities caused by a decrease in value of depreciated operating properties within the joint venture and adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities. 

The Company believes that EBITDAre is useful to investors, creditors and rating agencies as a supplemental measure of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry, and by excluding gains or losses related to sales or impairment of depreciated operating properties, EBITDAre can help compare the Company’s credit strength between periods or as compared to different companies. 

Normalized Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (“Normalized EBITDAre”) – Represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and further adjusted for non-comparable items. Normalized EBITDAre, total debt to Normalized EBITDAre and net debt to Normalized EBITDAre are important metrics in evaluating the credit strength of the Company and its ability to service its debt obligations. The Company believes that Normalized EBITDAre, total debt to Normalized EBITDAre, and net debt to Normalized EBITDAre are useful to investors, creditors and rating agencies because they allow investors to compare the Company’s credit strength to prior reporting periods and to other companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company’s actual credit quality. 

Economic Gain (Loss) – Economic Gain (Loss) is calculated as the net gain (loss) on sales of real estate properties in accordance with GAAP, excluding accumulated depreciation. The Company generally considers Economic Gain (Loss) to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net gain (loss) on sales of real estate properties in accordance with GAAP because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company's acquisition, development, renovation, management and ultimate sale of a property and because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold property. The following table presents a reconciliation of net gain (loss) on sales of real estate properties in accordance with GAAP to Economic Gain (Loss):

FFO and Normalized FFO: 

Funds From Operations (“FFO”) – Nareit defines FFO (December 2018 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and land when connected to the main business of a REIT, impairment write-downs of investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and depreciation and amortization related to real estate. Adjustments for partially owned consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Expected FFO per share is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO per share and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected EPS.

(All per share data is diluted) 

The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and excluding depreciation related to real estate (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. 

Normalized Funds From Operations ("Normalized FFO") – Normalized FFO begins with FFO and excludes: 

•  

the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating asset impairment; 

•  

pursuit cost write-offs; 

•  

gains and losses from early debt extinguishment and preferred share redemptions; 

•  

gains and losses from non-operating assets; and 

•  

other miscellaneous items. 

Expected Normalized FFO per share is calculated on a basis consistent with actual Normalized FFO per share and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected EPS. 

The Company believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the Company's operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company's actual operating results. 

FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. 

FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with GAAP. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

Lease-Up NOI – Represents NOI for development properties: (i) in various stages of lease-up; and (ii) where lease-up has been completed but the properties were not stabilized (defined as having achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months) for all of the current and comparable periods presented. 

Leasing Concessions – Reflects upfront discounts on both new move-in and renewal leases on a straight-line basis. 

Net Operating Income (“NOI”) – NOI is the Company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment properties. NOI is defined as rental income less direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance). The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment properties. NOI does not include an allocation of property management expenses either in the current or comparable periods. Rental income for all leases and operating expense for ground leases (for both same store and non-same store properties) are reflected on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP for the current and comparable periods.  

The following tables present reconciliations of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to NOI, along with rental income, operating expenses and NOI per the consolidated statements of operations allocated between same store and non-same store/other results (see Same Store Results):

Total Market Capitalization – The aggregate of the market value of the Company’s outstanding common shares, including restricted shares, the market value of the Company’s operating partnership units outstanding, including restricted units (based on the market value of the Company’s common shares) and the outstanding principal balance of debt. The Company believes this is a useful measure of a real estate operating company’s long-term liquidity and balance sheet strength, because it shows an approximate relationship between a company’s total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the Company’s common shares trade. However, because this measure of leverage changes with fluctuations in the Company’s share price, which occur regularly, this measure may change even when the Company’s earnings, interest and debt levels remain stable. 

Traffic – Consists of an expression of interest in an apartment by completing an in-person tour, self-guided tour or virtual tour that may result in an application to lease. 

Transaction Accretion (Dilution) – Represents the spread between the Acquisition Cap Rate and the Disposition Yield.  

Turnover – Total Residential move-outs (including inter-property and intra-property transfers) divided by total Residential apartment units. 

Unencumbered NOI % – Represents NOI generated by consolidated real estate assets unencumbered by outstanding secured debt as a percentage of total NOI generated by all of the Company's consolidated real estate assets. 

Unlevered Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) – The Unlevered IRR on sold properties is the compound annual rate of return calculated by the Company based on the timing and amount of: (i) the gross purchase price of the property plus any direct acquisition costs incurred by the Company; (ii) total revenues earned during the Company’s ownership period; (iii) total direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance) incurred during the Company’s ownership period; (iv) capital expenditures incurred during the Company’s ownership period; and (v) the gross sales price of the property net of selling costs. 

The calculation of the Unlevered IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company’s property management expense, general and administrative expense or interest expense (including loan assumption costs and other loan-related costs). Therefore, the Unlevered IRR is not a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unlevered IRR achieved during the period a property is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company’s acquisition, development, renovation, management and ultimate sale of a property, before the impact of Company overhead. The Unlevered IRR achieved on the properties as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other properties owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unlevered IRRs upon the disposition of other properties. The weighted average Unlevered IRR for sold properties is weighted based on all cash flows over the investment period for each respective property, including net sales proceeds. 

Weighted Average Coupons – Contractual interest rate for each debt instrument weighted by principal balances as of December 31, 2021. In case of debt for which fair value hedges are in place, the rate payable under the corresponding derivatives is used in lieu of the contractual interest rate. 

Weighted Average Rates – Interest expense for each debt instrument for the year ended December 31, 2021 weighted by its average principal balance for the same period. Interest expense includes amortization of premiums, discounts and other comprehensive income on debt and related derivative instruments. In case of debt for which derivatives are in place, the income or expense recognized under the corresponding derivatives is included in the total interest expense for the period.
