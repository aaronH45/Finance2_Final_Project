FINANCE APPENDIX   

Non-GAAP Measures and Basis for Financial Presentation We have historically existed and functioned as part of the consolidated business of Zimmer Biomet. The accompanying financial information is prepared on a standalone basis and derived from Zimmer Biomet’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDA are alternative views of our performance that we provide because they are expected to be important internal measures. Since EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These metrics should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP adjustments to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are described in this Appendix. The accompanying historical financial information reflects the historical financial results of Zimmer Biomet’s spine (including bone healing technologies) and dental businesses and includes all revenues and costs directly attributable to our businesses, including costs for facilities, functions, and services we utilize, and also includes an allocation of expenses related to certain Zimmer Biomet commercial and corporate functions, including distribution quality, regulatory, information technology, finance, executive, human resources and legal. The accompanying Management Adjusted EBITDA gives effect to the separation of these businesses into an independent, publicly traded company. Management adjustments include, but are not limited to: • Certain costs to establish ourselves as a standalone public company, as well as ongoing additional costs associated with operating as an independent, publicly traded company; • Acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses incurred for a specified period of time • Corporate-related items such as non-cash stock option expense and allocation of expenses related to certain Zimmer Biomet commercial and corporate functions, including distribution, quality, regulatory, information technology, finance, executive, human resources and legal • Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; • Other costs that we consider highly variable and are for a specified period of time The management adjustments are based on available information and assumptions that management believes are reasonable given the information that is currently available. The accompanying historical and management adjusted financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future. With respect to the Company’s guidance for Management Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in 2021E and Adjusted EPS in 2022, a reconciliation of Management Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and Adjusted EPS to net income (loss) per share, the most comparable GAAP measures, is not available without unreasonable effort due to the Company’s limited visibility into and inability to make accurate projections and estimates of items including GAAP allocations and other GAAP carveout adjustments. These items may vary greatly from year to year and could significantly impact the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Page 67

[2] Excludes goodwill impairment from Adjusted EBITDA because of the significance of these charges and their non-cash nature. [3] Restructuring, acquisition, integration, divestiture and related costs are expenses from our Parent’s corporate restructuring program and from acquisitions and related integration that are directly related to the Company and are for a specified period of time. Therefore, we exclude these costs from Adjusted EBITDA. [4] Excludes certain Parent-related allocated expenses from projects, events or other various costs that are considered highly variable and for a specified period of time. These costs include expenses and gains from initial compliance with the EU Medical Device Regulation for previously-approved products, compliance with Parent’s deferred prosecution agreement related to certain US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act matters, allocation of costs from Parent’s global restructuring program, allocation of costs related to Parent’s integration activities of acquired businesses, and the impact from excess and obsolete inventory on certain product lines we intend to discontinue.
