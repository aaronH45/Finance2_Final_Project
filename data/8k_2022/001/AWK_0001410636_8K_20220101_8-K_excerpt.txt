On January 1, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), American Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company”) completed the previously disclosed sale of its regulated utility operations in New York to Liberty Utilities (Eastern Water Holdings) Corp. (“Liberty”), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated November 20, 2019, as amended, by and among the Company, the Company’s New York subsidiary and Liberty (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), on the Closing Date, Liberty purchased from the Company all of the capital stock of the Company’s New York subsidiary, and the Company received from Liberty the purchase price of $608 million in cash. The sale was approved by the New York State Department of Public Service on December 16, 2021.

The foregoing description of the Stock Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text thereof, filed as Exhibits 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

On January 3, 2022, the Company issued a press release announcing the transactions described in this Item 8.01. A copy of the press release issued by the Company is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits. 

(d) Exhibits.

The following exhibits to this Current Report have been provided herewith as noted below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Stock Purchase Agreement filed as Exhibits 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 hereto has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, the Company’s New York subsidiary or Liberty, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement (i) were made by the parties thereto only for purposes of that agreement and as of specific dates; (ii) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Stock Purchase Agreement; (iii) may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement (such disclosures include information that has been included in public disclosures, as well as additional non-public information); (iv) may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Stock Purchase Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and (v) may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors.

Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, the Company’s New York subsidiary or Liberty, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Additionally, the representations, warranties, covenants, conditions and other terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the Closing Date, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures. The Stock Purchase Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the Company and the Company’s New York subsidiary that is or will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the reports and other documents that are filed by the Company with the SEC.
