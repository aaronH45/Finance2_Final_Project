        "Further reducing our international flying this summer is a difficult decision, but ultimately, itâ€™s the right one for our team members and customers. American will continue to offer almost 6,000 peak-day departures this summer, more than any other airline. While we are disappointed in the continued delay of our 787-8 deliveries, we remain focused on running a reliable operation on our path to profitability by delivering for our customers the best global network."
