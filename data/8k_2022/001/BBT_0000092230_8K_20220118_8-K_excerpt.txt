ITEM 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On January 18, 2022, Truist Financial Corporation (“Truist”) issued a press release reporting fourth quarter 2021 results and posted on its website its fourth quarter 2021 Earnings Release, Quarterly Performance Summary, and Earnings Release Presentation. The materials contain forward-looking statements regarding Truist and include cautionary language identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. The Earnings Release, Quarterly Performance Summary, and Earnings Release Presentation are furnished as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, and 99.3, respectively. Consequently, they are not deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such materials may only be incorporated by reference into another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K. All information in the Earnings Release, Quarterly Performance Summary, and Earnings Release Presentation speaks as of the date thereof, and Truist does not assume any obligation to update such information in the future.
