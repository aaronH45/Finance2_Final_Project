SUMMARY OF SEGMENT RESULTS

Beef

Sales volume decreased due to the impacts associated with a challenging labor environment and increased supply chain constraints, partially offset by strong global demand. Average sales price increased as input costs such as live cattle, labor, freight and transportation costs increased and demand for our beef products remained strong. Operating income increased due to strong demand as we continued to optimize revenues relative to live cattle supply and a reduction in direct incremental expenses related to COVID-19, partially offset by production inefficiencies due to the impacts associated with a challenging labor environment. Additionally, operating income in fiscal 2021 was impacted by a $55 million gain from the recovery of cattle inventory related to a cattle supplier's misappropriation of Company funds. 

Pork

Sales volume was up slightly as strong global demand was offset by the impacts associated with a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased as input costs such as live hogs, labor, freight and transportation costs increased and demand for our pork products remained strong, partially offset by unfavorable mix associated with labor shortages. Operating income increased due to strong demand as we optimized revenues relative to live hog supply and a reduction in direct incremental expenses related to COVID-19, partially offset by the impacts associated with a challenging labor environment. 

Chicken

Sales volume increased primarily due to increased live production and a strong demand environment. Average sales price increased due to the effects of an inflationary cost environment. Operating income increased due to increased sales volume and higher average sales prices, partially offset by the impacts of inflationary market conditions including $185 million of higher feed ingredient costs, increased supply chain costs and a challenging labor environment. Additionally, operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was impacted by $23 million of insurance proceeds, net of costs incurred related to a fire at a production facility and was impacted in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 by a $320 million loss from the recognition of a legal contingency accrual.

Prepared Foods

Sales volume decreased due to the divestiture of our pet treats business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as well as lower production throughput primarily associated with a challenging labor and supply environment. Average sales price increased primarily due to the effects of revenue management in an inflationary cost environment. Operating income decreased due to the impacts of inflationary market conditions, including $215 million of increased raw materials and other input costs, increased supply chain costs and a challenging labor environment, partially offset by favorable pricing.

OUTLOOK

For fiscal 2022, the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) indicates domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) should be relatively flat as compared to fiscal 2021 levels. The following is a summary of the outlook for each of our segments, as well as an outlook for revenues, capital expenditures, net interest expense, liquidity and tax rate for fiscal 2022.3

Beginning in fiscal 2022, we launched a new productivity program, which is designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision making. We are targeting $1 billion in productivity savings by the end of fiscal 2024 and $300 million to $400 million in fiscal 2022, relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline. We are currently on track to achieve our planned productivity savings for fiscal 2022.

Beef

USDA projects domestic production will decrease approximately 1% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. We anticipate another strong year with adjusted operating margin at the upper end of 9% to 11% in fiscal 2022. We expect the first half of the fiscal year will be stronger than the second half as a combination of higher utilization and demand for cattle may result in a narrowing spread.

Pork

USDA projects domestic production will decrease approximately 2% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. We believe our Pork segment's adjusted operating margin will be 5% to 7% in fiscal 2022.

Chicken

USDA projects chicken production will increase approximately 2% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. We anticipate an adjusted operating margin of 5% to 7% for fiscal 2022 as our adjusted operating margin is expected to achieve this on a run rate basis by the middle of the year resulting in overall stronger performance in the second half of the fiscal year.

Prepared Foods

We believe our adjusted operating margin will be at the upper end of 7% to 9% in fiscal 2022. We will remain disciplined in our pricing initiatives to ensure that additional inflationary pressures are mitigated by sales price increases, while also working diligently to deliver productivity savings to reduce costs.

International/Other

We anticipate improved results from our foreign operations in fiscal 2022.

Revenue

We expect sales to be at the upper end of $49 billion to $51 billion in fiscal 2022.

Capital Expenditures

We expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion for fiscal 2022. Capital expenditures include spending for capacity expansion and utilization, automation to alleviate labor challenges and brand and product innovation.

Net Interest Expense

We expect net interest expense to approximate $360 million for fiscal 2022.

Liquidity

We expect total liquidity, which was approximately $5.2 billion at January 1, 2022, to remain above our minimum liquidity target of $1.0 billion.

Tax Rate

We currently expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 23% in fiscal 2022.

3 The Company is not able to reconcile its full-year fiscal 2022 projected adjusted results to its fiscal 2022 projected GAAP results because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of our control. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature of the amount of future adjustments, such as legal contingency accruals and other significant items which could be significant, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for these forward-looking non-GAAP measures without unreasonable effort. Adjusted operating margin should not be considered a substitute for operating margin or any other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Investors should rely primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.

4 Excludes the amortization of debt issuance and debt discount expense of $2 million for the three months ended January 1, 2022, $3 million for the three months ended January 2, 2021, $19 million for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021, and $18 million for the twelve months ended January 1, 2022 as it is included in interest expense.

5 Relates to a plant relocation from a government land expropriation and includes accelerated depreciation and team member related charges recognized as an increase of Cost of Sales.

6 Legal contingency accruals included $320 million recognized as a reduction of Sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and $545 million recognized as a reduction of Sales and $81 million recognized as an increase of Cost of Sales in fiscal 2021. 

7 Relates to fires at production facilities in Chicken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and Beef in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Amount includes insurance proceeds, net of costs incurred, of $23 million recognized in Cost of Sales and $22 million net proceeds recognized in Other, net in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and $23 million net expense recognized in Cost of Sales and $6 million net proceeds recognized in Other, net for fiscal 2021.

EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Net debt to EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA) represents the ratio of our debt, net of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt to EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a tool intended to assist our management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations on an ongoing basis.

We believe the presentation of these financial measures helps management and investors to assess our operating performance from period to period, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt, enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. These measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies; however, the measurements of EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) may not be comparable to those of other companies, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) involve outlays of cash. As a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA). Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.

Adjusted net income per share attributable to Tyson (Adjusted EPS) is presented as a supplementary measure of our financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We use Adjusted EPS as an internal performance measurement and as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe Adjusted EPS is meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial performance and is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report Adjusted EPS. Further, we believe that Adjusted EPS is a useful measure because it improves comparability of results of operations from period to period. Adjusted EPS should not be considered a substitute for net income per share attributable to Tyson or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions. Our calculation of Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
