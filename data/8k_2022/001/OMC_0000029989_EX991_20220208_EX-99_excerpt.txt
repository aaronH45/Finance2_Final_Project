Fourth Quarter 2021 Results

Revenues

Our worldwide revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 continued to improve from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue increased 2.6% to $3,855.9 million from $3,757.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The components of the change in revenue included an increase in revenue from organic growth of

9.5%, a decrease in acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, of 6.6%, and a decrease in revenue from the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 0.3%. The decrease in acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, reflects the sale of ICON International, a specialty media business, in June 2021.

Organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 increased across all of our fundamental disciplines, including: 7.4% for Advertising, 19.6% for Precision Marketing, 12.4% for Commerce & Brand Consulting, 56.7% for Experiential, 5.2% for Execution & Support, 4.4% for Public Relations and 4.5% for Healthcare.

Organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 across our regional markets was as follows: 7.8% for the United States, 1.8% for Other North America, 10.1% for the United Kingdom, 12.7% for the Euro Markets & Other Europe, 7.8% for Asia Pacific, 7.3% for Latin America and 48.1% for the Middle East & Africa.

Expenses

Operating expenses increased $91.1 million, or 2.9%, to $3,233.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, including a decrease of 0.2% from the impact of foreign currency translation. Salary and service costs, which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue, increased $70.9 million, or 2.6%, to $2,792.1 million, reflecting an increase in salary and related costs of $187.2 million and a decrease in third-party service costs of $116.3 million. The increase in salary and related service costs resulted primarily from the increase in organic revenue. Third-party service costs, including proprietary media, decreased during the quarter due primarily to the disposition of ICON, partially offset by costs related to our organic growth in revenue. Occupancy and other costs, which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs, increased $11.3 million, or 4.2%, to $277.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, due to higher general office expenses, partially offset by lower rent and other occupancy costs. SG&A expenses increased $8.5 million, or 8.4%, to $109.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, due to an increase in marketing, professional fees, and new business costs.

Operating Profit

Operating profit increased $7.8 million, or 1.3%, to $622.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, and our operating margin of 16.1% decreased from 16.4%.

Interest expense on debt in the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased $2.4 million to $45.8 million primarily as a result of the benefit from the early redemption in May 2021 of all the outstanding $1.250 billion principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2022, partially offset by the May 2021 issuance of $800 million of 2.60% Senior Notes due 2031 and the November 2021 issuance of £325 million of 2.25% Senior Notes due 2033.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate of 23.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased from 25.0% in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2021, income tax expense was reduced by $21.1 million primarily from the favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions.

Salary and service costs, which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue, increased $829.2 million, or 8.7%, to $10,402.0 million, reflecting an increase in salary and related service costs of $720.1 million and an increase in third-party service costs of $109.1 million.

Occupancy and other costs, which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs, increased $9.7 million, or 0.9%, to $1,148.2 million compared to 2020, due to higher general office expenses, partially offset by lower rent and other occupancy costs. SG&A expenses increased $19.2 million, or 5.3%, to $379.7 million compared to 2020, due primarily to an increase in professional fees, new business costs, and marketing. 

Operating Profit

Operating profit increased $599.1 million, or 37.5%, to $2,197.9 million compared to 2020, and our operating margin of 15.4% increased from 12.1%.

COVID-19 Business Update

As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy continues to moderate, we experienced an improvement in our business in 2021 as compared to 2020. In 2021, revenue increased $1,118.3 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2020. The increase in revenue primarily reflects increased client spending in all our disciplines and across all our geographic areas compared to the prior year and the strengthening of most foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound and the Euro, against the U.S. Dollar. The increase in revenue year-over-year was partially offset by a reduction in acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue reflecting 

Page 3

the sale of ICON International, or ICON, a specialty media business, in the second quarter of 2021. Global economic conditions may continue to be volatile as long as the COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health threat, which could negatively impact our clients' spending plans. We expect global economic performance and the performance of our businesses to vary by geography and discipline until the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy subsides.

Definitions - Components of Revenue Change

We use certain terms in describing the components of the change in revenue above. 

Foreign exchange rate impact: calculated by translating the current period’s local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue. The foreign exchange rate impact is the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period constant currency revenue.

Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue: Acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date. As a result, acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition date is attributed to organic growth. Disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of disposals through the disposition date. The acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the description above. 

Organic growth: calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact component and the acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue component from total revenue growth.

Revenue by Discipline

Effective January 1, 2021, we realigned the classification of certain services primarily within our CRM Consumer Experience discipline. As a result, this discipline is now grouped into four categories: Precision Marketing, which includes our precision marketing and digital/direct marketing agencies; Commerce and Brand Consulting, which is primarily comprised of Omnicom Commerce Group, including our shopper marketing businesses, and Omnicom Brand Consulting agencies; Experiential, which includes our experiential marketing agencies and events businesses; and Execution & Support, which includes field marketing, merchandising and point of sale, as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications services.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in describing our performance. We use EBITA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of intangible assets) and EBITA Margin (defined as EBITA divided by revenue) as additional operating performance measures, which exclude the non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets (primarily consisting of amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions). Accordingly, we believe EBITA and EBITA Margin are useful measures for investors to evaluate the performance of our business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.
