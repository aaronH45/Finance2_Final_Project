Other Information.  

On February 25, 2022, Aon plc (the “Company”) identified a cyber incident impacting a limited number of systems. Promptly upon its identification of the incident, the Company launched an investigation, and engaged the services of third-party advisors, incident response professionals, and counsel. The incident has not had a significant impact on the Company’s operations. Although the Company is in the early stages of assessing the incident, based on the information currently known, the Company does not expect the incident to have a material impact on its business, operations or financial condition.  

Safe Harbor Statement  

This communication contains certain statements related to future results, or states Aon’s intentions, beliefs and expectations or predictions for the future which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from either historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors. These forward-looking statements include information relating to the possible impact of the cyber incident, including the Company’s expectations regarding the impact of the cyber incident on its business, operations or financial condition.  

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or anticipated by the forward looking statements: the ongoing assessment of the cyber incident; legal, reputational and financial risks resulting from the cyber incident or additional cyber incidents; and the other factors set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.  

Any or all of Aon’s forward-looking statements may turn out to be inaccurate. The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Aon is not under, and expressly disclaims, any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
