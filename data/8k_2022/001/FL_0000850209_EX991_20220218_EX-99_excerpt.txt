(a) A lump sum payment of Nine Hundred Ninety-Seven Thousand Five Hundred dollars ($997,500), less all relevant taxes and other withholdings, which shall be paid within ten (10) days following the six (6) month anniversary of the Separation Date, subject to the Employee’s timely execution and non-revocation of this Agreement; 

(b) If the Employee timely and properly elects COBRA continuation coverage under the Employer’s health plan, the Employee may be permitted to continue participation in the Plan under COBRA by continuing to pay premiums to the Employer at the contribution level in effect for active employees until the earliest of: (i) the expiration of eighteen (18) months following the Separation Date; (ii) the date the Employee becomes covered under another employer's health plan; or (iii) the expiration of the maximum COBRA continuation coverage period for which the Employee is eligible under federal law. At the end of this period, the Employee shall be eligible to continue coverage, pursuant to COBRA, and shall be responsible for the entire COBRA premium for the remainder of the applicable COBRA continuation period;

Unless specifically provided herein, this Agreement, together with the letter agreement dated January 19, 2022 and the Exhibits attached thereto, contains all of the understandings and representations between Employer and Employee relating to his separation of employment and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, discussions, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding such subject matter; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement modifies, supersedes, voids, or otherwise alters Employee's Non-Competition and Confidentiality obligations and other covenants contained in his Employment Agreement. 

14. Modification and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement may be amended or modified unless the amendment or modification is agreed to in writing and signed by the Employee and by the General Counsel of the Employer. No waiver by either Party of any breach by the other party of any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by the other Party shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time, nor shall the failure of or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement  

11  

operate as a waiver thereof to preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power, or privilege. 

15. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, or enforceable only if modified, such finding shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding on the Parties.

21. Section 409A. This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Section 409A), including the exceptions thereto, and shall be construed and administered in accordance with such intent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, payments provided under this Agreement may only be made upon an event and in a manner that complies with Section 409A or an applicable exemption. Any payments under this Agreement that may be excluded from Section 409A either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service, as a short-term deferral, or as a settlement payment pursuant to a bona fide legal dispute shall be excluded from Section 409A to the maximum extent possible. For purposes of Section 409A, any installment payments provided under this Agreement shall each be treated as a separate payment. To the extent required under Section 409A, any payments to be made under this Agreement in connection with a termination of employment shall only be made if such termination constitutes a "separation from service" under Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employer makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Section 409A and in no event shall Employer be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest, or other expenses that may be incurred by Employee on account of non-compliance with Section 409A.

Exhibit B 

VIJAY TALWAR EXECUTIVE BENEFITS TRANSITION INFORMATION 

The following shows the effect of your termination on your benefits through Foot Locker, Inc., including its affiliated companies (“Foot Locker”). [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

14  

 401(k) Eligibility will cease as of your Termination Date. If you have a balance in the plan upon termination from Foot Locker, you can contact Principal, the plan administrator, about 2 weeks after your Termination Date to receive a distribution package. Please review the information and submit your election to the address indicated on the form. If your balance in the plan is $1,000 or more, you may leave your funds in the plan or elect to roll it over. If your balance is less than $1,000, you will receive a distribution package within 4 weeks of your Termination Date and if you do not make an election, you will be issued a distribution check. If you have an outstanding loan in the Plan, your outstanding balance will automatically become due on the first day of the month following 90 days after your Termination Date. If you do not repay your loan within this time period, the amount due will be treated as a taxable distribution to you, along with any other amounts actually paid to you in the year you terminate. 

 Pension You will receive information from Principal, the retirement plan administrator, approximately 4-6 weeks after your Termination Date. This will include instructions on what you can do with your pension, if you were vested in the plan.  

 Excess Pension Plan Per the IRS rules, as a key employee, your payment must be delayed six months following your termination. After the six-month delay, your full benefit will be paid automatically as a lump sum. Your non-qualified portion is subject to federal, state and local income tax. The withholding is based on the income tax withholding elections currently on file for you. 

 Stock Purchase Plan Eligibility in the program will cease on your Termination Date. You will be refunded the balance in your account as soon as administratively feasible. If you are at least age 55 and terminate within 4 months of the Annual Purchase Date, you may remain a participant and purchase shares on the purchase date. 

 Long Term Incentive (“LTI”) Awards Vested stock options may continue to be exercised as provided under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan for 3 months following your Termination Date, if you have less than 10 years of service with the Company. Any unvested stock options and/or restricted stock units as of your Termination Date will be forfeited. 

 Vacation Payout If on your Termination Date you have unused accrued vacation time, you will receive payment with your last regularly scheduled paycheck, or as soon as it is administratively feasible. 

 Relocation Per the Long-Term International Assignment Policy, the Company will arrange and pay for your return, the return of your accompanying spouse/partner and dependents, and the shipment of goods to your home country point of origin. Such a move, however, must take place no later than 30 days from the date of termination. Beyond that time, the Company will have no obligation to arrange and pay for such a move. 

 Tax Preparation The Company shall provide you with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) personal income tax preparation services with respect to the 2021 tax year as well as future tax years where there may be carryover income related to your assignment in the Netherlands. At the Company’s discretion, these services including tax equalization may be extended to apply to Company income until such time as all tax-related benefits, (e.g., Company-paid foreign tax credits, exclusions, deductions, etc.) have been realized by the Company via the tax equalization process. To the extent you engage any third-party provider to review your tax calculations, such fee will not be reimbursed to you by the Company.   

15  

 International Tax Credits Since you were employed on a tax equalized contract while on assignment, Foot Locker, Inc. will remain entitled to a refund of taxes paid on your behalf or any foreign tax credits attributable to your time on assignment. 

 Outplacement Services Provided that you sign and return the Release, in accordance with the terms of your Employment Agreement, to the Company, Foot Locker, Inc, will provide you with senior executive outplacement services provided by Impact Group.
