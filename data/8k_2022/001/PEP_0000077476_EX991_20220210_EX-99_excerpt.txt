Organic/Core (non-GAAP)1 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2021 Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

PURCHASE, N.Y. - February 10, 2022 - PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021.

“Our full year net revenue growth meaningfully accelerated in 2021 versus the previous year and this gives us added confidence that the investments we’ve made in our people, brands, innovation, supply chain, go-to-market systems and digitization initiatives are working,” said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.

Laguarta continued, “Moving forward, we remain committed to building advantaged capabilities that can help us win in the marketplace and become an even faster, even stronger and even better organization. Importantly, this includes putting sustainability and human capital at the center of everything we do with the recent implementation of PepsiCo Positive (pep+), a fundamental end-to-end transformation of what we do and how we do it to create growth and shared value.

For 2022, we expect to deliver 6 percent organic revenue growth, which is at the high-end of our long-term target range and implies a strong acceleration in our organic revenue growth on a two-year basis. Additionally, we expect to deliver 8 percent core constant currency earnings per share growth, which reflects the impact of inflationary pressures across our value chain and

planned investments in our business. We also announced a 7 percent increase in our annualized dividend, starting with our June 2022 payment which represents our 50th consecutive annual increase, and our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of PepsiCo common stock through February 2026.”

(a)Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume change due to product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE.

Discussion of Fourth-Quarter 2021 Reported Division Results:

In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 3 and A-7, reported operating results were driven by the following:

Frito-Lay North America

Operating profit increased 10%, primarily reflecting net revenue growth and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives and incremental transportation costs, an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and packaging material, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, lower restructuring and impairment charges contributed 5 percentage points to operating profit growth.

Quaker Foods North America

Operating profit grew 8%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, a 14-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses.

PepsiCo Beverages North America

Operating profit decreased 10%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, a 37-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings.

Latin America

Operating profit increased 21%, primarily reflecting net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 6-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 34-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 10-percentage-point impact of certain tax charges.

Europe

Operating profit decreased 16%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 41-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 5-percentage-point impact of higher restructuring and impairment charges. These impacts were partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings. Additionally, lower impact of certain tax charges and lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic each positively contributed 5 percentage points to operating profit performance.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in the United Kingdom caused a temporary disruption to our United Kingdom operations which had a negative impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance. These issues were largely resolved within the quarter and the business operations had resumed by year end.

Africa, Middle East and South Asia

Operating profit decreased 29%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 23-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by volume growth, productivity savings and a 3-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.

4

Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region

Operating profit decreased 25%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and an 11-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings. Additionally, higher restructuring and impairment charges, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher charges taken as a result of COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 6 percentage points, 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively.

Summary Full-Year 2021 Performance 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, including the impact of an extra month of volume for our acquisitions of Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods) in our Africa, Middle East and South Asia division and Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery) in our Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume change due to product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE.

Note: Amounts may not sum due to rounding.

Discussion of Full-Year 2021 Reported Division Results:

In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 6 and A-7, reported operating results were driven by the following:

Frito-Lay North America

Operating profit increased 5.5%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 3-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives and incremental transportation costs, and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging material and cooking oil.

Quaker Foods North America

Operating profit declined 14%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, and an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings.

PepsiCo Beverages North America

Operating profit increased 26%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, a 15-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, an 18-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Higher prior-year acquisition and divestiture-related charges contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit growth.

Latin America

Operating profit increased 33%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 4.5-percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 30-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. A current-year recognition of certain indirect tax credits in Brazil and lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed 6 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth.

Europe

Operating profit decreased 4.5%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 28-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and a 2.5-percentage-point impact each from higher restructuring and impairment charges and a gain on an asset sale in the prior year. These impacts were partially offset by the net revenue growth and productivity savings. Additionally, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals compared to the prior year positively contributed 5 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit performance.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the implementation of an ERP system in the United Kingdom caused a temporary disruption to our United Kingdom operations which had a negative impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance. These issues were largely resolved within the quarter and the business operations had resumed by year end.

Africa, Middle East and South Asia

Operating profit increased 43%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, a 31-percentage-point impact of the prior-year acquisition and divestiture-related charges associated with our Pioneer Foods acquisition and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost 

7

increases, a 13-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our Pioneer Foods acquisition contributed 3 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth. 

Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region

Operating profit increased 14%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 2- percentage-point contribution from our Be & Cheery acquisition, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment charges associated with an equity method investment reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage points. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth.

Juice Transaction

In the first quarter of 2022, we completed the previously announced divestiture of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $3.5 billion in cash (pre-tax) and a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across North America and Europe. These juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2021. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. We expect to record a non-core pre-tax gain of approximately $3 billion in the first quarter of 2022 as a result of this transaction.

Guidance and Outlook

The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and commodity mark-to-market net impacts.

For 2022, the Company expects: 

•A 6 percent increase in organic revenue;

•An 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS;

•A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; and

•Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.7 billion, comprised of dividends of $6.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.5 billion.

In addition, the Company expects a 1.5-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.

This assumption and the guidance above imply 2022 core earnings per share of $6.67, a 6.5 percent increase compared to 2021 core earnings per share of $6.26.

Dividend Increase and New Share Repurchase Program

The Company today announced a 7 percent increase in its annualized dividend to $4.60 per share from $4.30 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2022. This represents the Company’s 50th consecutive annual dividend per share increase.

The Company also announced a new share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10 billion of PepsiCo common stock through February 28, 2026.

Non-GAAP Measures

In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. 

We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; costs associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated with divestitures; pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Previously, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs will continue to be reflected in our core results. See below for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures included herein. 

Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

Glossary

We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:

Beverage volume: Volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.

Bottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.

Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.

Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.

Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. For further information regarding these excluded items refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2021 Form 10-K. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:

Mark-to-market net impact

Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.

Restructuring and impairment charges

Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.

Acquisition and divestiture-related charges

Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets, merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, closing costs, employee-related costs, gains associated with contingent consideration, contract termination costs and other integration costs.

A - 5

Pension and retiree medical-related impact

Pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains related to plan changes.

Charge related to cash tender offers 

As a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorded a charge primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers. 

Tax expense related to the TCJ Act

Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.

Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.

Organic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and where applicable, the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53rd reporting week), including in our 2022 financial results. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact, in the year ended December 25, 2021, of an extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods in our Africa, Middle East and South Asia division and Be & Cheery in our Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.

2022 guidance and long-term organic revenue target

Our 2022 organic revenue growth guidance and our long-term organic revenue growth target exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, the impact of the 53rd reporting week and foreign exchange translation. Our 2022 core effective tax rate guidance and our 2022 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses and restructuring and impairment charges. Our 2022 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2022 or our long-term organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2022 and long-term reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2022 and long-term impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2022 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2022 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2022 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2022 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2022 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
