DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 4, 2022--Power management company Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) today announced that earnings per share were $1.37 for the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding charges of $0.23 per share related to intangible amortization, $0.09 per share related to acquisitions and divestitures, and $0.03 per share related to a multi-year restructuring program, adjusted earnings per share of $1.72 were a fourth quarter record and up 19% over the fourth quarter of 2020.  

 Sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 were $4.8 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2020. The sales increase consisted of 6% growth in organic sales and 7% growth from acquisitions, which was partially offset by 10% from the divestiture of the Hydraulics business and 1% from negative currency translation.  

 Fourth quarter segment margins were 19.3%, a fourth quarter record and above the high end of the guidance. This represents a 190-basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2020.  

 Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $795 million. Excluding $61 million of taxes paid on the Hydraulics sale, adjusted operating cash flow of $856 million and adjusted free cash flow of $693 million were in line with the guidance.  

 Craig Arnold, Eaton chairman and chief executive officer, said, “We delivered a solid fourth quarter with record adjusted earnings per share, and I’m proud of how our teams are performing in a challenging environment. Our businesses are managing well under continued supply and labor constraints, achieving record fourth quarter segment margins with particular strength in Electrical Global and Aerospace.”  

 On full year results, Arnold continued, “Amid uncertainties, we’re very pleased with our record performance in 2021 including robust organic growth, record segment margins, transformative portfolio management and outstanding growth in earnings per share.”  

 For full year 2021, sales were $19.6 billion, up 10% from 2020. The sales increase consisted of 10% growth in organic sales, 5% growth from acquisitions, and 1% from positive currency translation, which was partially offset by 6% from the divestitures of the Lighting and Hydraulics businesses.  

 Segment margins of 18.9% for 2021 were a record and at the high end of the guidance range. This represents a 250-basis point improvement over full year 2020.  

 Earnings per share for 2021 were $5.34. Excluding charges of $0.90 per share related to intangible amortization, $0.23 per share related to acquisitions and divestitures, and $0.15 per share related to a multi-year restructuring program, adjusted earnings per share were $6.62, up 35% over 2020.  

 Operating cash flow for 2021 was $2.2 billion. Excluding $200 million of contributions to Eaton’s U.S. qualified pension plan and $340 million of taxes paid on the Hydraulics sale, adjusted operating cash flow was $2.7 billion and adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion.  

 For full year 2022, the company expects organic growth of 7-9% and adjusted earnings per share to be between $7.30 and $7.70, up 13% at the midpoint over 2021. For the first quarter of 2022, the company anticipates organic growth of 7-9% and adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.55 and $1.65.

 EATON CORPORATION plc 

 NOTES TO THE FOURTH QUARTER 2021 EARNINGS RELEASE  

 Amounts are in millions of dollars unless indicated otherwise (per share data assume dilution).  

 Note 1. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

 This earnings release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per ordinary share, adjusted operating cash flow, and adjusted free cash flow, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of each of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in this earnings release. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company revised its definition of adjusted earnings to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to apply this change. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they exclude certain transactions, allowing investors to more easily compare Eaton Corporation plc's (Eaton or the Company) financial performance period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton and each business segment.  

 The Company's first quarter and full year adjusted earnings guidance for 2022, follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 A reconciliation of operating cash flow to adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]
