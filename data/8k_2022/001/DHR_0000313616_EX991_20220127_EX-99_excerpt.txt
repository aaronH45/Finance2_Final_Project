DANAHER REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2021 RESULTS

WASHINGTON, D.C., January 27, 2022 -- Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR) (the “Company”) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. All results in this release reflect only continuing operations unless otherwise noted.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2021, net earnings were $1.8 billion, or $2.39 per diluted common share which represents a 44.0% year-over-year increase from the comparable 2020 period. 

Non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.69 which represents a 29.0% increase over the comparable 2020 period. For the fourth quarter 2021, revenues increased 20.5% year-over-year to $8.1 billion, with 19.5% non-GAAP core revenue growth. 

For the full year 2021, net earnings were $6.3 billion, or $8.50 per diluted common share which represents a 74.0% year-over-year increase. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share for 2021 were $10.05 per share, which represents a 59.0% increase over the comparable 2020 amount. Revenues for the full year 2021 increased 32.0% to $29.5 billion, with 25.0% non-GAAP core revenue growth including Cytiva.

Operating cash flow for the full year 2021 was $8.4 billion, representing a 34.5% increase year-over-year, and non-GAAP free cash flow was $7.1 billion, representing a 30.5% increase year-over-year.

Rainer M. Blair, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to deliver outstanding financial results — including 25% core revenue growth, nearly 60% adjusted earnings per share growth and over $7 billion of free cash flow. We were particularly pleased with the performance in our base business, which grew low-double digits, and believe we gained market share across our portfolio. We also continued to build for the future, deploying $11 billion on strategic acquisitions while accelerating innovation and capacity investments.”

Blair continued, “Over the last several years, our portfolio has undergone a significant, purpose-driven transformation. We’re a better, stronger company today, comprised of high-quality, market-leading franchises in attractive end-markets. We believe the combination of our exceptional portfolio, talented team and the Danaher Business System provides a strong foundation for 2022 and beyond.”

Starting with the first quarter 2022, in addition to presenting GAAP revenue growth, the Company will present base business core revenue growth that includes the impact of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic related revenue and excludes the impact of COVID-19 testing revenue. 

For both the first quarter and full year 2022, the Company anticipates that non-GAAP core revenue growth in the base business will be in the high-single digit percent range.

Danaher will discuss its results during its quarterly investor conference call today starting at 8:00 a.m. ET. The call and an accompanying slide presentation will be webcast on the “Investors” section of Danaher’s website, www.danaher.com, under the subheading “Events & Presentations.” A replay of the webcast will be available in the same section of Danaher’s website shortly after the conclusion of the presentation and will remain available until the next quarterly earnings call.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2 The impact of the MCPS Series A calculated under the if-converted method was dilutive for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2021, and as such 11.0 million shares underlying the MCPS Series A were included in the calculation of diluted EPS in both periods and the related MCPS Series A dividends of $20 million and $78 million were excluded from the calculation of net earnings for diluted EPS for the respective periods. 

The impact of the MCPS Series B calculated under the if-converted method was anti-dilutive for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2021, and as such 8.6 million shares underlying the MCPS Series B were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation in both periods and the related MCPS Series B dividends of $21 million and $86 million were included in the calculation of net earnings for diluted EPS for the respective periods.

The impact of the MCPS Series A and MCPS Series B calculated under the if-converted method was anti-dilutive for the three-month period and year-ended December 31, 2020, and as such, 19.6 million shares and 17.1 million shares, respectively underlying the MCPS Series A and Series B were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for the periods and the related MCPS Series A and Series B dividends of $41 million and $136 million, respectively, were included in the calculation of net earnings for diluted EPS for the periods.

3 The number of converted shares assumes the conversion of all MCPS and issuance of the underlying shares applying the “if-converted” method of accounting and using an average 20 trading-day trailing volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of $316.06 and $223.43 as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Core Sales Growth, Core Sales Growth Including Cytiva and Base Business Core Sales Growth

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: Danaher calculates period-to-period core sales growth including Cytiva by adding Cytiva sales to core sales for both the baseline and current periods. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021, Cytiva sales are included in core sales, and therefore the measure “core sales growth including Cytiva” is no longer provided for quarterly periods beginning with the second quarter of 2021. Therefore, the impact of Cytiva sales growth represents only the impact of Cytiva sales in the first quarter of 2021, prior to the inclusion of Cytiva sales in core sales. Impact of COVID-related tailwinds includes revenue from COVID-19 related testing and revenues related to products that support the pursuit and production of COVID-19 related treatments and vaccines. 

Forecasted Core Sales Growth and Base Business Core Sales Growth 4

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4 We do not reconcile these measures to the comparable GAAP measure because of the inherent difficulty in predicting and estimating the future impact and timing of currency translation, acquisitions and divested product lines, which would be reflected in any forecasted GAAP revenue.

Note: While we expect overall demand for the Company’s COVID-19 related products to moderate as and to the extent the pandemic subsides, as the pandemic evolves toward endemic status we believe a level of demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics (including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar, future pandemics) and COVID-19 testing will continue. However, on a relative basis, we expect the level of ongoing demand for products supporting COVID-19 testing will be subject to more fluctuations in demand than the level of demand for products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. Therefore, beginning with the first quarter of 2022, in addition to disclosing core revenue growth (as defined below), we will also disclose “base business core revenue growth” on a basis that excludes revenues related to COVID-19 testing and includes revenues from products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. We believe this additional measure will provide useful information to investors by facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our financial performance and identifying underlying growth trends in the Company’s business that otherwise may be obscured by fluctuations in demand for COVID-19 testing as a result of the pandemic.

Notes to Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures

A Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the following historical periods ($ in millions) (only the pretax amounts set forth below are reflected in the amortization line item above):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

B Costs incurred for fair value adjustments to inventory related to the acquisition of Aldevron in the three-month period ended December 31, 2021, ($13 million pretax as reported in this line item, $10 million after-tax). Costs incurred for fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue and transaction costs deemed significant related to the acquisitions of Cytiva and Aldevron in the year ended December 31, 2021, ($104 million pretax as reported in this line item, $82 million after-tax). Costs incurred for fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue related to the acquisition of Cytiva in the three-month period ended December 31, 2020, ($49 million pretax as reported in this line item, $39 million after-tax) and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs related to the acquisition of Cytiva for the year ended December 31, 2020, ($568 million pretax as reported in this line item, $450 million after-tax). The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a given period.

C Impairment charges related to a trade name in the Diagnostics segment recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021, ($10 million pretax as reported in this line item, $8 million after-tax). Impairment charges related to a facility in the Diagnostics segment and trade names and other intangibles assets in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020, ($22 million pretax as reported in this line item, $17 million after-tax). 

D Net gains/losses on the Company's equity and limited partnership investments in the following historical periods (in $ millions) (only the pretax amounts set forth below are reflected in the fair value net gains/losses on investments line above): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

E Gain on disposition of certain product lines in the year ended December 31, 2021, ($13 million pretax as reported in this line item, $10 million after-tax). Gain on disposition of certain product lines in the year ended December 31, 2020, ($455 million pretax as reported in this line item, $305 million after-tax).

F Expense related to the modification and partial termination of prior commercial arrangements and resolution of an associated litigation in the year ended December 31, 2021, ($547 million pretax as reported in this line item, $415 million after-tax).

G Loss on early extinguishment of debt resulting from “make-whole” payments and deferred costs associated with the retirement of the 2025 Euronotes in both the three-month period and the year ended December 31, 2021, ($96 million pretax as reported in this line item, $73 million after-tax). Loss on early extinguishment of debt resulting from “make-whole” payments and deferred costs associated with the retirement of the 2022 Euronotes in both the three-month period and the year ended December 31, 2020, ($26 million pretax as reported in this line item, $20 million after-tax).

H This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the preceding line items of the table. In addition, the footnotes above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment item. Danaher estimates the tax effect of each adjustment item by applying Danaher’s overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment. The MCPS dividends are not tax deductible and therefore the tax effect of the adjustments does not include any tax impact of the MCPS dividends.

I Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for both the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2021, include the impact of net discrete tax benefits of $120 million (or $0.16 per diluted common share), and $263 million (or $0.35 per diluted common share), respectively, related primarily to release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the mix of earnings between the U.S. and certain jurisdictions with lower overall tax rates, net of changes in estimates associated

with prior period uncertain tax positions. Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2020, include the impact of net discrete tax benefits of $85 million (or $0.12 per diluted common share) related primarily related to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions from audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by a higher tax rate associated with the gain on the divestiture of certain product lines in the Life Sciences segment and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. The Company anticipates excess tax benefits from stock compensation of approximately $7 million per quarter and therefore excludes benefits in excess of this amount in the calculation of adjusted diluted net earnings from continuing operations per common share.

J In March 2019, the Company issued $1.65 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of 4.75% MCPS Series A. In May 2020, the Company issued $1.72 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of 5.0% MCPS Series B. Dividends on the MCPS Series A and Series B are payable on a cumulative basis at an annual rate of 4.75% and 5.0%, respectively, on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. Unless earlier converted, each share of MCPS Series A will automatically convert on April 15, 2022 into between 6.6611 and 8.1598 shares of Danaher’s common stock, subject to further anti-dilution adjustments. Unless earlier converted, each share of MCPS Series B will automatically convert on April 15, 2023 into between 5.0103 and 6.1376 shares of Danaher’s common stock, subject to further anti-dilution adjustments. The number of shares of Danaher’s common stock issuable on conversion of the MCPS will be determined based on the VWAP) per share of the Company's common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading day immediately before April 15, 2022 and April 15, 2023 for the MCPS Series A and Series B, respectively. For the calculation of net earnings per common share from continuing operations, the impact of the dilutive MCPS is calculated under the if-converted method and the related MCPS dividends are excluded. For the purposes of calculating adjusted earnings per common share from continuing operations, the Company has excluded the paid and anticipated MCPS cash dividends and assumed the “if-converted” method of share dilution (the incremental shares of common stock deemed outstanding applying the “if-converted” method of calculating share dilution only with respect to any MCPS the conversion of which would be dilutive in the particular period are referred to as the “Converted Shares”) for any MCPS that were anti-dilutive for the given period. For additional information about the impact of the MCPS on the calculation of diluted EPS, see note 2 in the Adjusted Average Common Stock and Common Equivalent Diluted Shares Outstanding table above.

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures

Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation’s (“Danaher” or the “Company”) results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors to:

•with respect to Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing Operations, understand the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers;

•with respect to core sales and related sales measures, identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our sales performance with prior and future periods and to our peers; and

•with respect to free cash flow from continuing operations and related cash flow measures (the “FCF Measure”), understand Danaher’s ability to generate cash without external financings, strengthen its balance sheet, invest in its business and grow its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities (although a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not take into account the Company’s debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures, and as a result the entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures).

We also present core sales on a basis that includes sales attributable to Cytiva (formerly the Biopharma Business of General Electric Company’s (“GE”) Life Sciences business), which Danaher acquired from GE on March 31, 2020. Historically Danaher has calculated core sales solely on a basis that excludes sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. However, given Cytiva’s significant size and historical core sales growth rate, in each case compared to Danaher’s existing businesses, management believes it is appropriate to also present core sales on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. Management believes this presentation provides useful information to investors by demonstrating beginning immediately after the acquisition Cytiva’s impact on the Company’s growth profile, rather than waiting to demonstrate such impact 12 months after the acquisition when Cytiva would normally have been included in Danaher’s core sales calculation. Danaher calculates period-to-period core sales growth including Cytiva by adding to the baseline period sales Cytiva’s historical sales from such period (when it was owned by GE), net of the sales of the Company product lines divested in 2020 to obtain regulatory approval to acquire Cytiva (“Cytiva sales”) and also adding the Cytiva sales to the current period. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021, Cytiva sales are included in core sales, and therefore we no longer provide the measure “core sales including Cytiva” for quarterly periods beginning with the second quarter of 2021. We also present “base business” core revenue growth to demonstrate our core revenue growth and our core revenue growth including Cytiva excluding core sales growth directly attributable to COVID-19 and its impact.

While we expect overall demand for the Company’s COVID-19 related products to moderate as and to the extent the pandemic subsides, as the pandemic evolves toward endemic status we believe a level of demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics (including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar, future pandemics) and COVID-19 testing will continue. However, on a relative basis, we expect the level of ongoing demand for products supporting COVID-19 testing will be subject to more fluctuations in demand than the level of demand for products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. Therefore, beginning with the first quarter of 2022, in addition to disclosing core revenue growth (as defined below), we will also disclose “base business core revenue growth” on a basis that excludes revenues related to COVID-19 testing and includes revenues from products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. We believe this additional measure will provide useful information to investors by facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our financial performance and identifying underlying growth trends in the Company’s business that otherwise may be obscured by fluctuations in demand for COVID-19 testing as a result of the pandemic. 

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance, and uses core sales and non-GAAP measures similar to Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing Operations and the FCF Measure in the Company’s executive compensation program.

The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons:

•With respect to Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing Operations:

◦Amortization of Intangible Assets. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price 

8

allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to sales generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. 

◦Restructuring Charges. We exclude costs incurred pursuant to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different (in terms of the size, strategic nature and planning requirements, as well as the inconsistent frequency, of such plans) from the ongoing productivity improvements that result from application of the Danaher Business System. Because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and we believe are not indicative of Danaher’s ongoing operating costs in a given period, we exclude these costs to facilitate a more consistent comparison of operating results over time. 

◦Other Adjustments. With respect to the other items excluded from Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing Operations, we exclude these items because they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. 

•With respect to adjusted average common stock and common equivalent shares outstanding, Danaher’s Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS”) will mandatorily convert into Danaher common stock on the mandatory conversion date, which is expected to be April 15, 2022 and April 15, 2023 for the Series A and Series B MCPS, respectively, (unless converted or redeemed earlier in accordance with the terms of the applicable certificate of designations). With respect to the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing Operations, we apply the “if converted” method of share dilution to the MCPS Series A and B in all applicable periods irrespective of whether such preferred shares would be dilutive or anti-dilutive in the period. We believe this presentation provides useful information to investors by helping them understand what the net impact will be on Danaher’s earnings per share-related measures once the MCPS convert into Danaher common stock. 

•With respect to core sales related measures, (1) we exclude the impact of currency translation because it is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) we exclude the effect of acquisitions (other than Cytiva, in the case of core sales including Cytiva and base business core sales) and divested product lines because the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.

•With respect to the FCF Measure, we exclude payments for additions to property, plant and equipment (net of the proceeds from capital disposals) to demonstrate the amount of operating cash flow for the period that remains after accounting for the Company’s capital expenditure requirements.

With respect to forecasted core sales related measures, we do not reconcile these measures to the comparable GAAP measure because of the inherent difficulty in predicting and estimating the future impact and timing of currency translation, acquisitions and divested product lines, which would be reflected in any forecasted GAAP revenue.
