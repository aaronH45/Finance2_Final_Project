Edison International Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2021 Results

​

●Fourth Quarter 2021 GAAP earnings per share of $1.38; Core EPS of $1.16

●Full-Year 2021 GAAP EPS of $2.00; Core EPS of $4.59 exceeds guidance 

●Edison International declares quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share; annualized rate of $2.80 per share

●EIX announces 2022 EPS guidance of $4.40–4.70 and reiterates long-term EPS growth rate target of 5–7%

​

ROSEMEAD, Calif., February 24, 2022 — Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported fourth quarter 2021 net income of $523 million, or $1.38 per share, compared to net income of $526 million, or $1.39 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2020. As adjusted, fourth quarter 2021 core earnings were $440 million, or $1.16 per share, compared to core earnings of $451 million, or $1.19 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2020.

​

Southern California Edison’s (SCE) fourth quarter 2021 core earnings per share (EPS) increased year-over-year primarily due to higher revenue from the 2021 General Rate Case (GRC) final decision and income tax benefits from the settlement of 2007 – 2012 California tax audits, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses and higher net financing costs.

​

Edison International Parent and Other's fourth quarter 2021 loss per share increased year-over-year primarily due to higher preferred dividends as a result of preferred equity issuances in 2021.

​

“We delivered solid 2021 results with EPS exceeding the guidance range. Additionally, SCE continues to significantly reduce wildfire risk and the utility’s ongoing and planned mitigation actions give us increased confidence of further risk reduction,” said Pedro J. Pizarro, president and CEO of Edison International. 

​

Pizarro added, “SCE sees substantial investment opportunities over the next several years to bolster grid safety and resiliency. Furthermore, with one of the strongest electrification profiles in the industry, SCE is accelerating economywide electrification with investments in transportation and building electrification to help meet California’s climate goals. All these initiatives give us high confidence in achieving EPS growth of 5 to 7% from 2021 to 2025. Combined with the 4%+ current dividend yield, we see strong potential for double-digit total return for EIX shares — before potential P/E multiple expansion to recognize significant utility and government risk reduction progress to-date and yet ahead.”

​

Full-Year Earnings

​

For 2021, Edison International reported net income of $759 million, or $2.00 per share, compared to $739 million, or $1.98 per share, for 2020. As adjusted, Edison International's core earnings were $1,741 million, or $4.59 per share, compared to $1,686 million, or $4.52 per share, in 2020.

​

SCE's full-year core EPS was higher due to higher revenue from the 2021 GRC final decision, higher FERC revenue and income tax benefits from the settlement of 2007 – 2012 California tax audits, partially offset by lower insurance benefits and higher property taxes.

​

​

Edison International Parent and Other’s full-year loss per share increased primarily due to higher preferred dividends as a result of preferred equity issuances in 2021.

​

Edison International uses core earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts for significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Edison International management believes that core earnings provide more meaningful comparisons of performance from period to period. Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of core earnings to basic GAAP earnings.

Appendix

​

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

​

Edison International’s earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company’s earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (EPS) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance of Edison International and Southern California Edison. We also use core earnings and core EPS when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company’s performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to as net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also apply to the description of earnings or earnings per share.

​

Core earnings and core EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as basic earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Basic earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders. Core earnings are reconciled to basic earnings in the attached tables. The impact of participating securities (vested awards that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for the principal operating subsidiary is not material to the principal operating subsidiary’s EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which is included in Edison International Parent and Other.

Important factors that could cause different results include, but are not limited to the:

​

•ability of SCE to recover its costs through regulated rates, including uninsured wildfire-related and debris flow-related costs, costs incurred to mitigate the risk of utility equipment causing future wildfires, costs incurred to implement SCE's new customer service system, costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased labor and materials costs due to supply chain constraints and inflation;

•ability of SCE to implement its Wildfire Mitigation Plan and capital program;

•risks of regulatory or legislative restrictions that would limit SCE's ability to implement Public Safety Power Shutoff (“PSPS”) when conditions warrant or would otherwise limit SCE's operational PSPS practices;

•risks associated with implementing PSPS, including regulatory fines and penalties, claims for damages and reputational harm;

•ability of SCE to maintain a valid safety certification;

•ability to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost, including insurance relating to SCE's nuclear facilities and wildfire-related claims, and to recover the costs of such insurance or, in the event liabilities exceed insured amounts, the ability to recover uninsured losses from customers or other parties;

•extreme weather-related incidents (including events caused, or exacerbated, by climate change, such as wildfires, debris flows, droughts, high wind events and extreme heat events) and other natural disasters (such as earthquakes), which could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage, operational issues (such as rotating outages and issues due to damaged infrastructure), PSPS activations and unanticipated costs;

•risks that California Assembly Bill 1054 (“AB 1054”) does not effectively mitigate the significant exposure faced by California investor-owned utilities related to liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where utility facilities are alleged to be a substantial cause, including the longevity of the Wildfire Insurance Fund and

•physical security of Edison International's and SCE's critical assets and personnel and the cybersecurity of Edison International's and SCE's critical information technology systems for grid control, and business, employee and customer data;

•risks associated with cost allocation resulting in higher rates for utility bundled service customers because of possible customer bypass or departure for other electricity providers such as Community Choice Aggregators (“CCA,” which are cities, counties, and certain other public agencies with the authority to generate and/or purchase electricity for their local residents and businesses) and Electric Service Providers (entities that offer electric power and ancillary services to retail customers, other than electrical corporations (like SCE) and CCAs); 

•risks inherent in SCE's capital investment program, including those related to project site identification, public opposition, environmental mitigation, construction, permitting, changes in the California Independent System Operator’s transmission plans, and governmental approvals; and
