Item 8.01. Other Events. 

On February 23, 2022, the Board of Directors of Under Armour, Inc. (the “Company”) authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million (exclusive of fees and commissions) of outstanding shares of its Class C common stock, $0.0003 1/3 par value per share (the “Class C Common Stock”), pursuant to a new share repurchase program. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares of Class C Common Stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions, block purchases, or other transactions, including accelerated share repurchase programs.

The share repurchase program will expire on February 23, 2024 and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase shares of Class C Common Stock and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements and other investment opportunities. Information regarding share repurchases will be available in the Company’s periodic reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as required by the applicable rules of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

On February 23, 2022, the Company issued a press release announcing that it entered into the share repurchase program. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
