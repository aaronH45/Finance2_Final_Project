Higher 2021 results were driven primarily by natural gas liquids (NGL) volume growth across ONEOK’s operations, natural gas processing volume growth in the Rocky Mountain region, higher commodity prices and increased natural gas sales in the natural gas pipelines segment. Results included higher operating costs due primarily to higher employee costs related to short-term incentives, increased property taxes and higher outside services expenses in 2021. Net income was also impacted by higher depreciation expense due to completed capital-growth projects placed in service. Full-year 2020 net income included non-cash impairment charges related primarily to goodwill and long-lived assets in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.

 ONEOK Announces Higher Full-year 2021 Earnings and 2022 Financial Guidance Feb. 28, 2022 Page 5 -more- The increase in fourth quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA, compared with the fourth quarter 2020, primarily reflects: • A $122.5 million increase in exchange services due primarily to higher volumes across ONEOK’s operations and wider commodity price differentials; and • A $13.3 million increase in optimization and marketing due primarily to wider location and commodity price differentials and higher optimization volumes, offset partially by lower earnings on purity NGL sales; offset by • A $34.1 million increase in operating costs due primarily to higher outside services expenses, increased property taxes associated with ONEOK’s completed capital-growth projects and higher employee costs related to short-term incentives. The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2021, compared with 2020, primarily reflects: • A $421.4 million increase in exchange services (excluding the impact of Winter Storm Uri discussed below) due primarily to: ◦ $261.6 million related to higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain region, Mid- Continent region and Permian Basin, offset partially by lower volumes in the Barnett Shale, ◦ $98.9 million related to wider commodity price differentials, ◦ $63.8 million in lower transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain region, and ◦ $12.9 million related to the recognition of proceeds previously considered a gain contingency, and • A $98.3 million increase in optimization and marketing due primarily to wider location and commodity price differentials, increased activities during Winter Storm Uri and higher optimization volumes; offset by • A $46.2 million decrease in exchange services related to Winter Storm Uri due primarily to decreased volumes across ONEOK’s operations and higher electricity costs; • A $103.0 million increase in operating costs due primarily to increased property taxes associated with ONEOK’s completed capital-growth projects, higher employee costs related to short-term incentives and higher outside services expenses; and • An $18.9 million decrease in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to lower volumes on the Overland Pass Pipeline.

 ONEOK Announces Higher Full-year 2021 Earnings and 2022 Financial Guidance Feb. 28, 2022 Page 8 -more- NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURES: ONEOK has disclosed in this news release adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), which is a non-GAAP financial metric, used to measure the company’s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense, allowance for equity funds used during construction (equity AFUDC), and other noncash items. Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it, and similar measures, is used by many companies in the industry as a measure of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate ONEOK’s financial performance and to compare the company’s financial performance with the performance of other companies within the industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is included in the tables. ONEOK, Inc. (pronounced ONE-OAK) (NYSE: OKE) is a leading midstream service provider and owner of one of the nation's premier natural gas liquids (NGL) systems, connecting NGL supply in the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Permian regions with key market centers and an extensive network of natural gas gathering, processing, storage and transportation assets.
