Net income attributable to D.R. Horton in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 44% to $1.1 billion compared to $791.8 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Homebuilding revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 17% to $6.7 billion from $5.7 billion in the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Homes closed in the quarter decreased 2% to 18,396 homes compared to 18,739 homes closed in the same quarter of fiscal 2021.

Net sales orders for the first quarter ended December 31, 2021 increased 5% to 21,522 homes and 29% in value to $8.3 billion compared to 20,418 homes and $6.4 billion in the same quarter of the prior year. The Company’s cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders) for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 15% compared to 18% in the prior year quarter. The Company's sales order backlog of homes under contract at December 31, 2021 increased 3% to 29,347 homes and 24% in value to $11.1 billion compared to 28,487 homes and $8.9 billion at December 31, 2020.

At December 31, 2021, the Company had 54,800 homes in inventory, of which 25,600 were unsold. 1,000 of the Company’s unsold homes at December 31, 2021 were completed.

The Company's return on equity (ROE) was 32.4% for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and homebuilding return on inventory (ROI) was 38.5% for the same period. ROE is calculated as net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the trailing twelve months divided by average stockholders' equity, where average stockholders' equity is the sum of ending stockholders' equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five. Homebuilding ROI is calculated as homebuilding pre-tax income for the trailing twelve months divided by average inventory, where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five.

The Company ended the first quarter with $2.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2.0 billion of available capacity on its revolving credit facility for total homebuilding liquidity of $4.1 billion. Homebuilding debt at December 31, 2021 totaled $3.3 billion, which includes $350 million of senior notes that mature in September 2022. The Company’s homebuilding debt to total capital ratio at December 31, 2021 was 17.3%. Homebuilding debt to total capital ratio consists of homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus homebuilding notes payable. 

Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, “The D.R. Horton team delivered outstanding results in the first fiscal quarter of 2022, highlighted by EPS increasing 48% to $3.17 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 45% to $1.5 billion on a 19% increase in revenues to $7.1 billion and a 380 basis point increase in our pre-tax profit margin to 21.2%. These results reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands.

“Housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are still selling homes later in the construction cycle so we can better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers. We continue to focus on building the infrastructure and processes to support a higher level of home starts while working to stabilize and then reduce our construction cycle times to historical norms. We started 25,500 homes during the quarter, resulting in a 30% increase in our homes in inventory at December 31, 2021 compared to a year ago. Our January home starts and net sales order volume were in line with our plans, and we are confident that we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 29,300 homes in backlog, 54,800 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships.

“We remain focused on maximizing returns and improving capital efficiency in each of our communities while increasing our market share. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company, including returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis.”
