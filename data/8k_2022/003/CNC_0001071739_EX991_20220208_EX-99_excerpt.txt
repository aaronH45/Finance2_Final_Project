Other Events

•In January 2022, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Magellan Health, Inc. (Magellan) for $95.00 per share in cash for a total purchase price of approximately $2.6 billion. The Magellan acquisition enables Centene to provide whole-health, integrated healthcare solutions to deliver better health outcomes at lower costs for complex, high-cost populations.

•In January 2022, Ken Burdick, Christopher Coughlin, Wayne DeVeydt, Leslie Norwalk and Theodore Samuels were appointed to the Centene Board of Directors. James Dallas was appointed Lead Independent Director and will assume the role of Independent Chairman by the end of 2022. Also in January, Robert Ditmore, John Roberts and Tommy Thompson retired from the Board of Directors. 

•In December 2021, Centene sold a majority stake in U.S. Medical Management, LLC (USMM) and recognized a gain. The Company believes this best positions USMM to expand its reach and impact while helping Centene to deliver on its value creation plan. The Company used the cash proceeds to repurchase common stock in December 2021.

•In November 2021, Centene announced its Arizona subsidiaries Arizona Complete Health-Complete Care Plan and Care1st Health Plan Arizona were selected by the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System for a Competitive Contract Expansion to continue providing access to physical and behavioral healthcare services to persons with Serious Mental Illness and to administer the state's crisis system, grant-funded services and court ordered evaluations. The new agreement is anticipated to commence in October 2022.

•In July 2021, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Neidorff informally communicated to the Board that he may decide for personal reasons to step down before the end of his contract, after which the Board and Mr. Neidorff established a succession planning initiative to ensure a full continuity plan. This succession planning process was discussed in the Company’s Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, filed July 29, 2021. Subsequently, in December 2021, Centene announced Mr. Neidorff's intent to retire as Chief Executive Officer in 2022. Mr. Neidorff will serve as Executive Chairman throughout the remainder of 2022, upon his retirement as Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors will be responsible for appointing a new CEO following a thorough selection process, including evaluating internal and external candidates with the support of an external search firm.

Statement of Operations: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021

•For the fourth quarter of 2021, total revenues increased 15% to $32.6 billion from $28.3 billion in the comparable period of 2020. The increase was due to Medicaid membership growth resulting from the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations, membership growth in the Medicare business, our acquisitions of PANTHERx and Circle Health and the commencement of our contracts in North Carolina, partially offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.

•HBR of 87.9% for the fourth quarter of 2021 represents a decrease from 88.4% in the comparable period in 2020. The HBR for the fourth quarter of 2021 benefited from decreased testing and treatment costs associated with COVID-19 in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and lower retroactive state premium rate adjustments and risk sharing mechanisms compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. These decreases were partially offset by higher traditional medical utilization and the repeal of the health insurer fee. 

•The Cost of Service ratio was 86.0% for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to 88.5% in the same period in 2020. The decrease in the cost of service ratio was driven by the acquisition of the Circle Health business, which operates at a lower cost of service ratio.

•The SG&A expense ratio was 9.3% for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to 10.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 9.2% for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to 9.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The SG&A ratios in 2021 benefited from the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues as a result of increased membership and our acquisition of PANTHERx, partially offset by the addition of the Circle Health business, which operates at a significantly higher SG&A ratio due to the nature of the business. The SG&A expense ratio also benefited from lower acquisition related costs. 

•During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a $150 million pre-tax, or $0.25 per diluted share, gain related to the sale of our majority stake in USMM.

•The effective tax rate was 14.6% for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to (74.3)% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 reflects the gain on sale of our majority stake in USMM and the repeal of the health insurer fee effective in 2021. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 reflects our pre-tax loss and the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 23.6%, compared to 10.0% in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Statement of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2021

•For the full year 2021, total revenues increased 13% to $126.0 billion from $111.1 billion in the comparable period of 2020. The increase over the prior year was due to Medicaid membership growth resulting from the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations, membership growth in the Medicare business, our acquisitions of PANTHERx and Circle Health in 2021 and the commencement of our contracts in North Carolina, partially offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.

•HBR of 87.8% for the full year 2021 represents an increase from 86.2% in the comparable period in 2020. The HBR for 2021 was negatively impacted by higher traditional medical utilization in the Marketplace business, higher testing and treatment costs associated with COVID-19, and the repeal of the health insurer fee. The HBR in 2020 was favorably impacted by the ACA risk corridor receivable settlement from the federal government based on the Supreme Court ruling in 2020. 

•The Cost of Service ratio was 86.4% for the full year 2021, compared to 88.2% for the full year 2020. The decrease in the cost of service ratio was driven by the acquisition of the Circle Health business, which operates at a lower cost of service ratio.

•The SG&A expense ratio was 8.6% for the full year 2021, compared to 9.5% for the full year 2020. The Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.4% for the full year 2021, compared to 8.9% for the full year 2020. The SG&A ratios in 2021 benefited from leveraging of expenses over higher revenues as a result of increased membership and the acquisition of PANTHERx, partially offset by addition of the Circle Health business, which operates at a significantly higher SG&A ratio due to the nature of the business. The SG&A expense ratio in 2021 also benefited from lower acquisition related costs. The SG&A expense ratios in 2020 were negatively impacted by the $275 million charitable contribution to our foundation. 

4

•The effective tax rate was 26.3% for 2021, compared to 35.3% for 2020. The effective tax rate for 2021 reflects the repeal of the health insurer fee, the non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of the remaining 60% interest in Circle Health, the partial non-deductibility of the legal settlement reserve, and the gain on the sale of our majority stake in USMM. For 2021, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 25.1%, compared to 30.1% for 2020.

Balance Sheet

At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash, investments and restricted deposits of $29.8 billion and maintained $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents in our unregulated entities, including $430 million in our international subsidiaries. Unregulated cash was substantially reduced in January 2022 upon the closing of the Magellan acquisition for the purchase price payment and corresponding closing costs. Medical claims liabilities totaled $14.2 billion. The Company's days in claims payable was 52 days, which is an increase of one day over the third quarter of 2021. Total debt was $18.8 billion, which included $149 million of borrowings on our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility at quarter end. The debt to capitalization ratio was 40.9% at December 31, 2021, excluding $184 million of non-recourse debt. The debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2021, includes the Magellan debt financing completed in the third quarter of 2021. In December 2021, the Company used divestiture proceeds and cash on hand to repurchase approximately $200 million of Centene common stock through our stock repurchase program.

Outlook

The Company reiterates its 2022 Adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.50 and HBR guidance of 87.6% to 88.2% provided at its December 2021 Investor Day. 

Overall, the Company's guidance is unchanged from its December 2021 Investor Day, with the exception of GAAP diluted EPS and acquisition related expenses, which have been updated to include approximately $25 million of Magellan acquisition related expenses to reflect the January 2022 acquisition closing (previously anticipated to be late December 2021). 

The Company's 2022 guidance is below and will be discussed on the conference call.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

To provide clarity on the way management defines certain key metrics and ratios, the Company is providing a description of how the metric or ratio is calculated as follows: 

•Health Benefits Ratio (HBR) (GAAP) = Medical costs divided by premium revenues.

•SG&A Expense Ratio (GAAP) = Selling, general and administrative expenses divided by premium and service revenues.

•Cost of Service Ratio (GAAP) = Cost of services divided by service revenues.

•Adjusted SG&A Expenses (non-GAAP) = Selling, general and administrative expenses, less acquisition related expenses, restructuring costs, and legal fees related to legal settlement.

•Adjusted SG&A Expense Ratio (non-GAAP) = Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses divided by premium and service revenues.

•Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (non-GAAP) = GAAP income tax expense (benefit) excluding the income tax effects of adjustments to net earnings divided by adjusted earnings (loss) before income tax expense.

•Adjusted Net Earnings (non-GAAP) = Net earnings less amortization of acquired intangible assets, less acquisition related expenses, as well as adjustments for other items, net of the income tax effect of the adjustments.

•Adjusted Diluted EPS (non-GAAP) = Adjusted net earnings divided by weighted average common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. 

•Debt to Capitalization Ratio (GAAP) = Total debt, divided by total debt plus total stockholder’s equity.

•Debt to Capitalization Ratio Excluding Non-Recourse Debt (non-GAAP) = Total debt less non-recourse debt, divided by total debt less non-recourse debt plus total stockholder’s equity.

•Average Medical Claims Expense (GAAP) = Medical costs for the period, divided by number of days in such period. Average Medical Claims Expense is most often calculated for the quarterly reporting period.

•Days in Claims Payable (GAAP) = Medical claims liabilities, divided by average medical claims expense. Days in Claims Payable is most often calculated for the quarterly reporting period.

In addition, the following terms are defined as follows:

•State Directed Payments: Payments directed by a state that have minimal risk, but are administered as a premium adjustment. These payments are recorded as premium revenue and medical costs at close to a 100% HBR. The Company has little visibility to the timing of these payments until they are paid by a state. 

•Pass Through Payments: Non-risk supplemental payments from a state that the Company is required to pass through to designated contracted providers. These payments are recorded as premium tax revenue and premium tax expense.

Centene's claims reserving process utilizes a consistent actuarial methodology to estimate Centene's ultimate liability. Any reduction in the “Incurred related to: Prior period” amount may be offset as Centene actuarially determines “Incurred related to: Current period.” As such, only in the absence of a consistent reserving methodology would favorable development of prior period claims liability estimates reduce medical costs. Centene believes it has consistently applied its claims reserving methodology. Additionally, approximately $492 million was recorded as a reduction from premium revenues resulting from development within “Incurred related to: Prior period” due to minimum HBR and other return of premium programs. 

The amount of the “Incurred related to: Prior period” above represents favorable development and includes the effects of reserving under moderately adverse conditions, new markets where we attempt to use a conservative approach in setting reserves during the initial periods of operations, receipts from other third party payors related to coordination of benefits and lower medical utilization and cost trends for dates of service December 31, 2020, and prior.
