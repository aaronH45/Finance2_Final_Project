Summary Financial Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth Quarter 2021 Results:

Revenue decreased 7% versus the prior year, primarily due to divestitures within Aviation Systems and supply chain-related constraints within Communication Systems, and decreased 1% on an organic basis. At the segment level, organic revenue was driven by Integrated Mission Systems and Space & Airborne Systems, up 6% and 2%, respectively, offset by a decline in Communication Systems and Aviation Systems, down 11% and 5%, respectively. Funded book-to-bill3 was 0.90 for the quarter. 

Net income margin expanded 720 bps and adjusted EBIT margin expanded 70 bps to 19.2% versus the prior year. GAAP EPS increased 167% to $2.46 driven primarily by prior-year charges for the impairment of intangibles, goodwill, and other assets related to the commercial aerospace business and other COVID-related impacts. Non-GAAP EPS increased 5% to $3.30 versus the prior year driven by e3 performance, integration benefits, expense management, and a lower share count, more than offsetting supply chain and divestiture-related impacts.

Full Year 2021 Results:

Revenue decreased 2% versus the prior year, primarily due to divestitures within Aviation Systems and supply chain-related constraints within Communication Systems, and increased 2% on an organic basis. At the segment level, organic revenue was driven by Integrated Mission Systems and Space & Airborne Systems, up 5% and 3%, respectively, partially offset by a decline in Communication Systems and Aviation Systems, down 3% and 2%, respectively. Funded book-to-bill was 1.02 for the year.

Net income margin expanded 430 bps and adjusted EBIT margin expanded 110 bps to 19.1% versus the prior year. GAAP EPS increased 75% to $9.09 driven primarily by prior-year charges for the impairment of goodwill and other assets and other COVID-related impacts. Non-GAAP EPS increased 12% to $12.95 versus the prior year driven by e3 performance, integration benefits, and a lower share count, more than offsetting supply chain and divestiture-related impacts as well as higher R&D investments.

Segment Results

Integrated Mission Systems 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth Quarter 2021 Results:

Revenue increased 6% from strong growth in ISR, driven by aircraft missionization on a NATO program, and in Electro Optical from higher product deliveries, partially offset by classified program timing in Maritime. Operating income increased 24% to $259 million, and operating margin expanded 230 bps to 16.6% versus the prior year from e3 and program performance, expense management, and integration benefits. Segment funded book-to-bill was 0.85.

Key contract awards in the fourth quarter included:

•Approximately $350 million in orders for advanced ISR capabilities across incumbent platforms, such as the Rivet Joint reconnaissance, National Command Authority, Compass Call and classified aircraft, further solidifying the company's position as a partner of choice with the U.S. Air Force

Segment funded book-to-bill was 1.00.

Space & Airborne Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth Quarter 2021 Results:

Revenue increased 2% versus the prior year driven by Space from a ramp on missile defense and other responsive programs. This growth was partially offset by the transition towards modernization programs within the airborne businesses, and classified program timing in Intel & Cyber. Operating income decreased 4% to $235 million, and operating margin contracted 120 bps to 18.3% versus the prior year as e3 performance, higher pension income, and integration benefits were more than offset by expense timing and mix impacts from growth programs. Segment funded book-to-bill was 0.95.

Key contract awards in the fourth quarter included:

•More than $275 million in orders on long-term airborne platforms (F-35, F/A-18, F-16, and B-52), including modernization and development, increasing total orders for the year to over $1.1 billion

•More than $225 million in classified responsive and exquisite space awards, potentially leading to multi-billion-dollar follow-on opportunities

•$125 million award from the U.S. Space Force for ground-based, deployable electronic warfare systems to safeguard U.S. military operations and warfighters

Full Year 2021 Results:

Revenue increased 3% versus the prior year and on an organic basis driven by Space from a ramp on missile defense and other responsive programs, as well as classified growth in Intel & Cyber. This growth was partially offset by the transition towards modernization programs within the airborne businesses. Operating income increased 4% to $970 million, and operating margin expanded 20 bps to 19.0% versus the prior year from e3 performance, higher pension income, and integration benefits, net of higher R&D investments and mix impacts from growth programs. Segment funded book-to-bill was 1.03.

Communication Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth Quarter 2021 Results:

Revenue decreased 11% due to anticipated product delivery delays from supply chain-related constraints mainly within Tactical Communications, lower volume on legacy platforms in Broadband Communications, contract roll-offs in Global Communications Solutions, and delivery timing within Integrated Vision Solutions. This decline was partially offset by higher sales in Public Safety. Operating income decreased 15% to $253 million, and operating margin contracted 100 bps to 24.9% versus the prior year as e3 performance and integration benefits were more than offset by supply chain impacts and higher R&D investments. Segment funded book-to-bill was 0.97.

Key contract awards in the fourth quarter included:

•More than $250 million, five-year, sole-source IDIQ contract from the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency for legacy radios and accessories 

•Approximately $225 million to provide advanced multi-channel Falcon IV® handheld radios, sustainment services, and other upgrades to international customers across key regions, reflecting a ramp in modernization 

•More than $80 million from the U.S. Special Operations Command, including a contract to integrate modernized software-defined manpack radios into MH-47 and MH-60 aircraft, and follow-on production orders under the Next Generation Tactical Communications multi-channel manpack IDIQ contract 

•Approximately $40 million in follow-on production orders under the U.S. Army's multi-billion-dollar HMS Manpack and two-channel Leader radio IDIQ contracts

•Approximately $40 million to provide video data link systems to international customers in the Asia-Pacific and European regions

Full Year 2021 Results:

Revenue decreased 4% versus the prior year and 3% on an organic basis due to product delivery delays from supply chain-related constraints mainly within Tactical Communications and lower volume on legacy unmanned platforms in Broadband Communications, along with a modest decline in Public Safety. This decline was partially offset by U.S. DoD modernization growth within Global Communications Solutions, with flat revenue in Integrated Vision Solutions. Operating income increased 1% to $1,092 million, and operating margin expanded 110 bps to 25.5% versus the prior year from e3 performance and integration benefits, net of supply chain impacts and higher R&D investments. Segment funded book-to-bill was 1.10.

Aviation Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 n/m: Not meaningful

Fourth Quarter 2021 Results:

Revenue decreased 37% versus the prior year due to divestitures, and decreased 5% on an organic basis from contract roll-offs and delayed awards within Defense Aviation, as well as lower FAA volume in Mission Networks. This decline was partially offset by a recovery in training and avionics product sales within the commercial aerospace business. The increase in GAAP operating income was driven by the prior-year impairment of goodwill and other assets related to the commercial aerospace business, and other COVID-related impacts, as well as expense management, net of divestitures. Non-GAAP operating income decreased 39% to $77 million primarily due to divestitures, and non-GAAP operating margin contracted 50 bps to 14.4% versus the prior year as expense management, commercial aerospace recovery, and integration benefits were more than offset by divestitures. Segment funded book-to-bill was 0.79.

Key contract awards in the fourth quarter included:

•Approximately $90 million classified award for next-generation systems, reflecting a key revenue synergy for the company and potentially leading to multi-billion-dollar follow-on opportunities

•More than $50 million in follow-on production awards for fuzing and ordnance systems from the U.S. DoD

Full Year 2021 Results:

Revenue decreased 19% versus the prior year due to divestitures, and decreased 2% on an organic basis driven by lower volume on divested businesses, as well as COVID-related impacts in the commercial aerospace business. This decline was partially offset by higher FAA volume in Mission Networks. The increase in GAAP operating income was driven by the prior-year impairment of goodwill and other assets related to the commercial aerospace business, and other COVID-related impacts, as well as e3 performance, net of divestitures. Non-GAAP operating income decreased 13% to $412 million primarily due to divestitures, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded 100 bps to 14.8% versus the prior year as e3 performance, expense management, and integration benefits more than offset divestitures. Segment funded book-to-bill was 0.90.

A “non-GAAP financial measure” is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future performance that excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). L3Harris management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. L3Harris management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze L3Harris business trends and to understand L3Harris performance. In addition, L3Harris may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

1Organic revenue and organic revenue growth exclude revenue attributable to each divested business for the portion of the prior-year period equivalent to the portion of the current-year period following the date the business was divested; refer to non-GAAP financial measure (NGFM) reconciliations in the tables accompanying this press release and to the disclosures in the non-GAAP section of this press release for more information.

2Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, non-GAAP EPS and adjusted free cash flow (FCF) are NGFMs; refer to NGFM reconciliations in the tables accompanying this press release for applicable adjustments and/or exclusions and to the disclosures in the non-GAAP section of this press release for more information. 

3Funded book-to-bill is calculated as the value of new contract awards received from the U.S. Government, for which the U.S. Government has appropriated funds, plus the value of new contract awards and orders received from customers other than the U.S. Government, divided by revenue. This includes incremental funding and adjustments to previous awards, and excludes unexercised contract options or potential orders under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts. The funded book-to-bill ratio is considered a key performance indicator in the Aerospace and Defense industry as it measures how much backlog is utilized in a certain period.

CY'21 Fourth Quarter Summary

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND REGULATION G DISCLOSURE

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we provide additional measures of income from continuing operations per diluted common share, net income, net income margin, net cash provided by operating activities, revenue and segment operating income (loss), adjusted to exclude certain costs, charges, expenses and losses or other amounts. L3Harris management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. L3Harris management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze L3Harris’ business trends and to understand L3Harris’ performance. In addition, L3Harris may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in its forecasting, budgeting, and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP follows:
