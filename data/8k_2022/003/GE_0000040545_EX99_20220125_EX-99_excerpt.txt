BOSTON — January 25, 2022 — GE (NYSE:GE) announced its fourth quarter and full year 2021 results.

GE Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. said, “2021 was an important year for the GE team, marked by significant strategic, operational, and financial progress. We delivered solid margin, EPS, and free cash flow performance in 2021, exceeding our outlook. Orders for the year were up double digits, supporting faster growth going forward, while supply chain challenges, commercial selectivity, and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. wind production tax credit impacted our top-line."

Culp continued, “We're seeing real momentum and opportunities for sustainable profitable growth from near-term improvements in GE's businesses, especially as Aviation recovers and our end markets strengthen. Our dramatic debt reduction means we can further intensify efforts to strengthen our operations and play offense, setting us up to deliver between $5.5 to $6.5 billion free cash flow in 2022 and more than $7 billion in 2023. As we lay the groundwork to create three independent companies focused on critical global needs, we're encouraged by the support from our customers, employees, and investors. We're confident that our businesses will deliver long-term growth and value.” 

GE continued to make progress on its transformation:

•Announced plans to form three independent, investment-grade, industry-leading companies focused on the growth sectors of aviation, healthcare, and energy.

•Solidified financial position by completing the GECAS transaction and a $25 billion debt tender in the quarter, reducing gross debt2 by approximately $87 billion over three years. GE has $35 billion of debt, approximately $16 billion of cash, and $13 billion3 in the AerCap equity stake and note and Baker Hughes equity stake. 

•Drove innovation and reinvested for growth, delivering technologies that transform lives:

◦Future of Flight: Powered the first passenger flight, on a United Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8, to use 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one engine. Awarded $1.6 billion contract for the U.S. Air Force's full F-15EX fleet. 

◦Precision Health: Scaled Vscan Air wireless, a pocket-sized handheld ultrasound, to more than 70 countries. Acquired BK Medical, enabling further expansion into surgical and therapy interventions.

◦Energy Transition: Reached financial close on Dogger Bank C, marking an order for 87 14MW HaliadeTM-X offshore wind turbines. Earned order from Guangdong Energy Group for the first 9HA.01 gas turbines to run on hydrogen-blended gas in China. GE Digital acquired grid software company Opus One.

Financial Statement Reporting Changes

After completing the GECAS transaction on November 1, GE is transitioning from three-column to one-column financial statement reporting to reflect strategic actions to simplify and strengthen the company. These changes are for all periods presented, and further supplemental materials are available on GE's Investor Relations website. 

In the prior three-column format, GE reported financial information for (i) GE on a consolidated basis, (ii) GE's industrial operations, and (iii) Capital, which is now smaller and no longer a separate reporting segment. The new one-column format reports all of GE’s remaining businesses on a consolidated basis. Additionally, through this change, GE is revising key performance indicators and non-GAAP financial metrics to provide a clearer view of core operating performance.

Total Company Results 

(new one-column reporting format)4

We present both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to provide investors with additional information. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures along with GAAP measures allows for increased comparability of our ongoing performance from period to period. Please see pages 9 - 19 for explanations of why we use these non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.

2021 Performance vs. Outlook 

(prior three-column reporting format)1

GE delivered strong financial performance in 2021 and enters 2022 with momentum:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a- EPS outlook given at the time changed from $0.15–$0.25 to $1.20–$2.00 post 1:8 reverse stock split effective close of trading July 30, 2021

(b- $5.8 billion excluding discontinued factoring* 

2022 Outlook 

(new one-column reporting format)4

GE announced the following total company outlook for full year 2022: 

•Organic revenues* to grow in the high-single-digit range

•Adjusted organic profit margin* to expand by 150+ basis points 

•Adjusted earnings per share* of $2.80 to $3.50 

•Free cash flow* of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion

GE expects to return to revenue growth in 2022. The company expects Aviation revenue to increase more than 20 percent in 2022, which is dependent on the continued commercial market recovery, as well as low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in Healthcare, driven by commercial efforts and new product launches. In Renewable Energy, continued operational improvement in Onshore Wind and growth in Offshore Wind will contribute to low-single-digit revenue growth and improved profitability. In Power, continued services strength will drive revenue growth. In 2022, GE is planning for continued inflation challenges, with the most adverse impact expected in Onshore Wind. Better earnings and working capital, especially inventory, along with a lower impact from legacy GE Capital, will enable GE to achieve its free cash flow range in 2022. 

GE will hold an Investor Update on Thursday, March 10, 2022, with additional details on its 2022 outlook.

Results by Reporting Segment 

(new one-column reporting format)4

The following segment discussions and variance explanations are intended to reflect management’s view of the relevant comparisons of financial results.

Aviation

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $7.7 billion increased 22% reported and organically with both Commercial Engines and Commercial Services up again substantially. Military was down largely due to a difficult prior-year comparison with significant F404 and F414 wins. Revenues of $6.1 billion were up 4% reported and organically* as Commercial Services grew significantly from higher shop visit volume. Commercial Engines and Military were both down, driven by lower unit shipments. Segment margin of 20.0% expanded by 1,040 basis points reported and 1,030 basis points organically*, driven by Commercial Services growth due to higher shop visit volume and Commercial Engines mix. 

For the year, revenues of $21.3 billion declined 3% reported and organically* due to fewer Commercial Engine deliveries. Segment margin of 13.5% expanded nearly 800 basis points reported and organically*, driven by a 10% increase in Commercial Services shop visits as well as operational cost reduction. Aviation continues to evaluate and manage the impact of Omicron, and is confident in the business fundamentals. 

Healthcare

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $5.3 billion increased 6% reported and 7% organically, and were up 8% versus 4Q'19. Healthcare Systems (HCS) orders increased 8% organically year-over-year and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics (PDx) orders grew 2% organically year-over-year. Revenues of $4.6 billion decreased 4% reported and organically* due to ongoing industry-wide supply shortages. HCS organic revenues* declined 5%, more than offsetting 2% organic growth* in PDx. Segment margin of 16.5% contracted 320 basis points reported and 290 basis points organically* year-over-year, driven by supply chain issues and inflation. Partially offsetting the decline was productivity and higher PDx volume. 

For the year, revenues of $17.7 billion decreased 2% reported, but increased 1% organically* despite supply chain impacts. While segment margin of 16.7% contracted 30 basis points reported, it expanded 70 basis points organically* driven by continued operational improvements. Healthcare is well positioned for continued profitable growth targeting 25-75 basis points of margin expansion as GE prepares to stand up the business as an independent company. 

4Basis for financial reporting going forward. Includes remaining Capital within Corporate 

* Non-GAAP Financial Measure 4

Renewable Energy

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $4.9 billion decreased 23% reported and 21% organically, driven by production tax credit uncertainty delaying investment in U.S. Onshore Wind equipment. Revenues of $4.2 billion decreased 6% reported and 5% organically* due to lower Onshore Wind equipment deliveries and continued project selectivity at Grid. Offshore Wind also declined driven by project timing. Partially offsetting this was strong services growth. Segment margin of (7.4)% contracted 540 basis points reported and organically*. Onshore Wind margins declined and were negative. At Grid, cost actions were more than offset by continued volume declines and legacy project costs. 

For the year, revenues of $15.7 billion were flat reported and down (2)% organically* driven by increased commercial selectivity in Grid and fewer equipment and repower deliveries at Onshore Wind. Partially offsetting this decline was increased revenue at Offshore Wind. Segment margin of (5.1)% contracted 50 basis points reported and 40 basis points organically* driven by lower volume as well as lower margins on new product introductions at Onshore Wind, more than offsetting cost reduction benefits. Long-term, Renewable Energy is firmly positioned to lead the energy transition, building on advanced technologies like the Haliade-X, which GE will begin delivering in 2022.

Power

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $4.3 billion decreased 23% reported and 21% organically with Gas Power declining due to a difficult prior year comparison and customer timing. This was partially offset by Steam growth in equipment and services. Revenues of $4.7 billion decreased 13% reported and 10% organically*. Equipment was down due to fewer unit shipments and continued reduced turnkey scope at Gas Power, as well as Steam Power's continued exit of new build coal. Segment margin of 6.6% expanded 90 basis points reported and 160 basis points organically* with all businesses positive in the quarter. Gas Power expansion was driven by services strength. 

For the year, revenues of $16.9 billion decreased 4% reported and organically* due to lower equipment revenues, partially offset by strong services growth. Segment margin of 4.3% expanded 270 basis points reported and 320 basis points organically* driven by Gas Power services mix and productivity. In 2022, there is continued opportunity for margin expansion and improved free cash flow as lean is further embedded and GE exits new build coal.

Other Updates

•GE's run-off insurance operations generated $0.4 billion of net income in the year, up significantly primarily due to strong investment results and favorable claims experience in GE's Long-term care portfolio, partially offset by higher paid claims in its Life portfolio. GE will finalize its annual statutory cash flow test in the first quarter of 2022, and currently expects this will be in line with permitted practice requirements.

•In discontinued operations, GE's run-off Polish BPH mortgage portfolio has a current gross balance of $2.4 billion5. In the fourth quarter, GE recorded charges of approximately $0.2 billion, mainly driven by more adverse results in the ongoing litigation with borrowers. This brings GE's total estimate of losses in connection with this litigation to $0.8 billion.

Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP

We believe that presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. This includes adjustments in recent periods to GAAP financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business.

In addition, management recognizes that certain non-GAAP terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. In various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-GAAP financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically GE Industrial revenues; organic revenues by segment; organic revenues; Healthcare Systems organic revenues; and PDx organic revenues, (2) profit, specifically Adjusted GE Industrial profit and margin; GE Industrial adjusted organic profit; organic profit and profit margin by segment; Adjusted profit and profit margin (excluding certain items); Adjusted organic profit and profit margin; Adjusted GE Industrial earnings (loss); Adjusted earnings (loss); Adjusted GE Industrial earnings (loss) per share; and Adjusted earnings (loss) per share (EPS), (3) cash flows, specifically free cash flows (FCF), GE Industrial FCF; and FCF excluding discontinued factoring, and (4) outlook, specifically 2022 Adjusted EPS; and 2022 FCF.

The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures follow. Certain columns, rows or percentages within these reconciliations may not add or recalculate due to the use of rounded numbers. Totals and percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.

Earnings-per-share amounts are computed independently. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total.

The service cost of our pension and other benefit plans are included in adjusted earnings (loss)*, which represents the ongoing cost of providing pension benefits to our employees. The components of non-operating benefit costs are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. Gains (losses) and restructuring and other items are impacted by the timing and magnitude of gains associated with dispositions, and the timing and magnitude of costs associated with restructuring and other activities. We believe that the retained costs in Adjusted earnings (loss)* provides management and investors a useful measure to evaluate the performance of the total company, and increases period-to-period comparability. We believe that presenting Adjusted Industrial earnings (loss)* separately for our financial services businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company.

2022 OUTLOOK: 2022 ADJUSTED EPS (NON-GAAP)

We cannot provide a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and corresponding GAAP measure for Adjusted EPS* in 2022 without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty of timing of any gains or losses related to acquisitions & dispositions, the timing and magnitude of the financial impact related to the mark-to-market of our remaining investment in AerCap and Baker Hughes, and the timing and magnitude of restructuring expenses. Although we have attempted to estimate the amount of gains and restructuring charges for the purpose of explaining the probable significance of these components, this calculation involves a number of unknown variables, resulting in a GAAP range that we believe is too large and variable to be meaningful.

2022 OUTLOOK: 2022 FREE CASH FLOWS (NON-GAAP)

We cannot provide a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and corresponding GAAP measure for free cash flows* in 2022 without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty of timing of deal taxes related to business sales.
