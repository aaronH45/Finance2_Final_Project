Company Provides 2022 Financial Outlook

ATLANTA, Feb. 10, 2022 – The Coca-Cola Company today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results, including another quarter of sequential improvement in volume trends compared to 2019. “In 2021, our system demonstrated resilience and flexibility by successfully navigating through another year of uncertainty,” said James Quincey, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. “We focused on our key strategies and emerged stronger. We are confident that progress on our strategic transformation has made us a nimbler total beverage company. While the environment remains dynamic, we will build on the momentum from 2021 to drive topline growth and maximize returns.” 

Highlights

Quarterly / Full-Year Performance

•Revenues: For the quarter, net revenues grew 10% to $9.5 billion, resulting in net revenues ahead of 2019, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 9%. Revenue performance included 10% growth in price/mix and a decline of 1% in concentrate sales. The quarter included six fewer days, which resulted in an approximate 6-point headwind to revenue growth. The quarter was also impacted by the timing of concentrate shipments. For the full year, net revenues grew 17% to $38.7 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 16%. This performance was driven by 9% growth in concentrate sales and 6% growth in price/mix.

•Margin: For the quarter, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 17.7% versus 27.2% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 22.1% versus 27.3% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 26.7% versus 27.3% in the prior

year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 28.7% versus 29.6% in the prior year. For both the quarter and the full year, operating margin compression was primarily driven by a significant increase in marketing investments versus the prior year. Additionally, fourth quarter operating margin was impacted by topline pressure from six fewer days in the quarter along with the timing of concentrate shipments. 

•Earnings per share: For the quarter, EPS grew 65% to $0.56, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) declined 5% to $0.45. For the full year, EPS grew 26% to $2.25, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 19% to $2.32. Both fourth quarter and full-year comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 2-point currency tailwind.

•Market share: For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages, which included share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. The company’s value share in total NARTD beverages, and in both at-home and away-from-home channels, remains ahead of 2019.

•Cash flow: Cash flow from operations for the year was $12.6 billion, up $2.8 billion versus the prior year, driven by strong business performance and working capital initiatives. Full-year free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $11.3 billion, up $2.6 billion versus the prior year, driven by strong cash flow from operations.

Company Updates

•Business environment: Compared to 2019, global unit case volume sequentially improved each quarter in 2021, resulting in full-year unit case volume being ahead of 2019. This performance was driven by ongoing, asynchronous recovery in many markets and the company’s ability to better adapt to successive waves of the pandemic. The fourth quarter marked the first quarter in which away-from-home volume was ahead of 2019, while strength in at-home channels also continued. Although reopenings continue to vary across the world, the company is combining the power of scale with the deep knowledge required to win locally and is continuing to invest ahead of the recovery in a targeted way. 

•Strengthening a consumer-centric portfolio through strategic acquisitions: During the fourth quarter, the company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in BODYARMOR, a line of sports performance and hydration beverages that has significant potential for long-term growth. Since gaining access to the company’s bottling system three years ago, BODYARMOR has driven continuous innovation in hydration products. For full-year 2021, BODYARMOR was the #2 sports drink in the category in measured retail channels in the United States, with retail value growth of approximately 50%. BODYARMOR will continue to be distributed by the company’s U.S. bottling system and will be managed as a separate business within the company’s North America operating unit.

•Transforming and modernizing marketing through one global marketing network partner: After an extensive review in 2021, the company named WPP as its global marketing network partner. WPP will play a key role in executing a new marketing model to drive long-term growth for the company’s global portfolio of brands. The new, integrated agency model is consumer-centric and leverages the power of big, bold ideas and creativity within experiences. The company intends to create end-to-end experiences that are grounded in data-rich consumer insights, optimized in real-time and implemented at scale. WPP, supported by a common data and technology platform that connects marketing teams throughout the company, will work with a strategic roster of approved agencies to provide access to the best creative minds and ideas.

•Further embedding sustainability into the business, including a new packaging target: The company’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals are embedded in operations and serve as key drivers of growth. To complement and support its World Without Waste goals, the company announced a new, global goal to reach 25% reusable packaging by 2030. Reusable packaging, including refillable containers for dispensed/fountain 

2

along with refillable or returnable glass and plastic bottles, supports the company’s collection goals and contributes to reducing the company’s carbon footprint, while aligning with consumer preferences for sustainable packaging options. Increasing reusable packaging and dispensed options responds to both consumer affordability and sustainability preferences, making it one of several important commercial levers to help achieve the company’s World Without Waste goals and contribute to the circular economy.

Therefore, the company places greater focus on revenue growth as the best indicator of underlying performance of the Global Ventures operating segment.

5 Reported operating income for Global Ventures for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was $78 million. Reported operating loss for Global Ventures for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was $9 million. Therefore, the percent change is not meaningful.

In addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following: 

Consolidated

•Unit case volume grew 9% for the quarter and 8% for the year, resulting in volume ahead of 2019. Volume growth was strong across most markets. The volume performance was driven by investments in the marketplace, ongoing recovery in markets where coronavirus-related uncertainty was abating, and the benefit from cycling the impact of the pandemic in the prior year. For both the quarter and the year, growth in developing and emerging markets was led by China, India and Russia, while growth in developed markets was led by the United States, Mexico and the United Kingdom. 

4

Category performance was as follows:

◦Sparkling soft drinks grew 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year, resulting in volume ahead of 2019, driven by strong performance across all geographic operating segments. Trademark Coca-Cola grew 7% for both the quarter and the year, resulting in volume ahead of 2019, led by Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia Pacific. Coca-Cola® Zero Sugar grew double digits for both the quarter and the year. Sparkling flavors grew 9% for both the quarter and the year, led by Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia Pacific.

◦Hydration, sports, coffee and tea grew 12% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Hydration grew 11% for the quarter and 5% for the year, with growth across all geographic operating segments. Sports drinks grew 18% for the quarter and 13% for the year, resulting in volume ahead of 2019, primarily driven by strong growth of BODYARMOR in the United States. Tea grew 10% for the quarter and 6% for the year, led by growth in Japan and the United States. Coffee grew 17% for the quarter and 15% for the year, primarily driven by the ongoing reopening of Costa® retail stores in the United Kingdom.

•Price/mix grew 10% for the quarter and 6% for the year, driven by pricing actions in the marketplace along with favorable channel and package mix due to cycling the impact of the pandemic in the prior year. Price/mix for the quarter was further benefited by positive segment mix. For the quarter, concentrate sales were 10 points behind unit case volume. This was primarily attributable to six fewer days in the quarter, which resulted in an approximate 6-point impact on concentrate sales, along with the timing of concentrate shipments. For the full year, concentrate sales were 1 point ahead of unit case volume, primarily due to bottler inventory build to manage near-term supply disruption.

•Operating income declined 28% for the quarter and grew 15% for the year, which included items impacting comparability and currency tailwinds. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) declined 12% for the quarter, driven by a significant increase in marketing investments versus the prior year. Additionally, fourth quarter operating income was impacted by topline pressure from six fewer days in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 12% for the full year, driven by strong organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth across all operating segments, partially offset by a significant increase in marketing investments versus the prior year.

Europe, Middle East & Africa

•Unit case volume grew 11% for the quarter, a low single-digit increase versus 2019, driven by ongoing recovery in markets where coronavirus-related uncertainty was abating, along with the benefit from cycling the impact of the pandemic in the prior year.

Outlook

The 2022 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2022 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2022 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2022 projected comparable cost of goods sold (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported cost of goods sold, full-year 2022 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2022 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported EPS or full-year 2022 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2022 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2022; the exact timing and amount of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes throughout 2022; the exact timing and amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2022; and the actual impact of changes in commodity costs throughout 2022. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company’s full-year 2022 reported financial results.

Full Year 2022

The company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 7% to 8%.

For comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 3% tailwind from acquisitions.

7

The company expects commodity price inflation to be a mid single-digit percentage headwind on comparable cost of goods sold (non-GAAP), based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.

The company’s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 20%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, if the company were not to prevail.

Given the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 10% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 5% to 6%, versus $2.32 in 2021.

Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 3% to 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a minimal tailwind from acquisitions.

The company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $10.5 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $12.0 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

First Quarter 2022 Considerations 

Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 3% tailwind from acquisitions. 

Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include an approximate 5% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.

The first quarter has one less day compared to first quarter 2021.

Notes

•All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.

•All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales for the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. “Unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. “Unit case volume” means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.

•“Concentrate sales” represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, “concentrate sales” represents the amount of coffee (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, “concentrate sales” represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. 

•“Price/mix” represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.

8

•First quarter 2021 financial results were impacted by five additional days as compared to first quarter 2020, and fourth quarter 2021 financial results were impacted by six fewer days as compared to fourth quarter 2020. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(UNAUDITED)

The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP” or referred to herein as “reported”). To supplement our consolidated financial statements reported on a GAAP basis, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures: “comparable net revenues,” “comparable currency neutral net revenues,” “organic revenues,” “comparable cost of goods sold,” “comparable operating margin,” “underlying operating margin,” “comparable operating income,” “comparable currency neutral operating income,” “comparable EPS,” “comparable currency neutral EPS,” “underlying effective tax rate” and “free cash flow,” each of which is defined below. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Further, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures also enhance investors’ ability to compare period-to-period financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are also included below. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company’s performance. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance.

DEFINITIONS

•“Currency neutral operating results” are determined by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results, by the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as appropriate, the derived current period local currency operating results by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to translate the company’s financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not changed from the comparable prior year period.

•“Structural changes” generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations, including the impact of intercompany transactions between our operating segments.

•“Comparable net revenues” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). “Comparable currency neutral net revenues” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below) as well as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes the comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) growth measure and the comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP) growth measure provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company’s revenue performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period results. “Organic revenues” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes, as applicable, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes the organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth measure provides users with useful supplemental information regarding the company’s ongoing revenue performance and trends by presenting revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. In 2021, the company acquired the remaining ownership interest in BODYARMOR. The impact of acquiring BODYARMOR has been included in acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment for the three months and year ended December 31, 2021. In 2020, the company discontinued our Odwalla juice business. The impact of discontinuing our Odwalla juice business has been included in acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

•“Comparable cost of goods sold” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Management believes comparable cost of goods sold

(non-GAAP) provides users with useful supplemental information regarding the company’s ongoing cost of goods sold by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period results.

•“Comparable operating income” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). “Comparable currency neutral operating income” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below) and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. “Comparable operating margin” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). “Underlying operating margin” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below), the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes, as applicable. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company’s performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable operating income (non-GAAP) growth measure, comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) growth measure, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) measure and underlying operating margin (non-GAAP) measure enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company’s underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results.

•“Comparable EPS” and “comparable currency neutral EPS” are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) has also been adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company’s performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable EPS (non-GAAP) and comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth measures enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company’s underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results.

•“Underlying effective tax rate” is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the estimated annual effective income tax rate on income before income taxes, which excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). 

•“Free cash flow” is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the company’s performance and make resource allocation decisions.

ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY

The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as “items impacting comparability” based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions; and evaluates the company’s ongoing performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as pertaining to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered “items impacting comparability.” Items impacting comparability include, but are not limited to, asset impairments, charges related to our strategic realignment initiatives, charges related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives, and transaction gains/losses including associated costs, in each case when exceeding a U.S. dollar threshold. Also included are our proportionate share of similar items incurred by our equity method investees, timing differences related to our economic (non-designated) hedging activities, and timing differences related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments of equity securities and trading debt securities, regardless of size. In addition, we provide the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results (“currency neutral operating results” defined above).

Asset Impairments

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2021, the company recorded an impairment charge of $78 million related to a trademark in Europe, which was driven by a change in our intent to renew the license agreement for a certain brand.

(“CCBJHI”), an equity method investee.

In addition, the company recorded a charge of $13 million for the impairment of goodwill in our bottling operations in the Middle East, which was primarily driven by a change in sugar tax laws, and recorded impairment charges totaling $10 million related to several trademarks in Latin America, which were primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and management’s view of the timing and extent of recovery.

Other Items

Economic (Non-Designated) Hedges

The company uses derivatives as economic hedges primarily to mitigate the foreign exchange risk for certain currencies, certain interest rate risk, and the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel.

The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.

Management believes this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our economic hedging activities.
