Equifax Delivers Record Revenue and Eighth Consecutive Quarter of Double-Digit Growth 

ATLANTA, February 9, 2022 -- Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2021. 

•Record fourth quarter 2021 revenue of $1.3 billion, up 12%

•Workforce Solutions revenue growth of 29%; eleven consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth

•Strong new product innovation leveraging new EFX Cloud

•Closed in February bolt-on acquisition of Efficient Hire to enhance differentiated data and strengthen Workforce Solutions

“We delivered a strong 2021 with our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Our fourth quarter revenue of $1.253 billion was a record, up 12% despite a continued decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Our largest and fastest-growing business Workforce Solutions again powered our results, growing 29% along with strong growth contributions from USIS non-mortgage and International revenue,” said Mark W. Begor, Equifax Chief Executive Officer. “We have strong momentum as we enter 2022 and are continuing to reinvest our strong outperformance in bolt-on acquisitions that further position Equifax for diversified growth, including Efficient Hire, which enhances our robust suite of employer services.”

“Our EFX2023 growth strategy driving accelerated New Product Innovation leveraging the EFX Cloud, continued strong growth of Workforce Solutions, and further expanding our differentiated data will drive revenue and margin growth in 2022 and beyond by delivering differentiated solutions that ‘Only Equifax’ can provide. We are reconfirming our prior framework with full-year 2022 guidance reflecting our expectation of performance at the midpoint of revenue in a range of $5.250 billion to $5.350 billion, and Adjusted EPS in a range of $8.50 to $8.80. This reflects an increase in our core revenue growth that offsets our expectation of a sharper decline in the U.S. mortgage market of 21.5% compared to last year. We are energized about the New Equifax and remain confident in our long-term 8-12% growth framework that will deliver higher margins and free cash flow.”

These statements are based on certain factors and assumptions including with respect to foreign exchange rates, expected growth, results of operations, performance, the outcome of legal proceedings, business prospects and opportunities and effective tax rates. While the Company believes these factors and assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available, they may prove to be incorrect.

Several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, actions taken by us, including restructuring or strategic initiatives (including our technology, data and security cloud transformation, capital investments and asset acquisitions or dispositions), as well as developments beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19 and changes in U.S. and worldwide economic conditions that materially impact consumer spending, consumer debt and employment and the demand for Equifax’s products and services. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions taken to control the spread of COVID-19 or treat its impact, and changes in U.S. and worldwide economic conditions. Further deteriorations in economic conditions, as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, could lead to a further or prolonged decline in demand for our products and services and negatively impact our business. It may also impact financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely impact our access to financing or the terms of any financing. We cannot at this time predict the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

Common Questions & Answers (Unaudited)

(Dollars in millions)

1. Can you provide a further analysis of operating revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year by operating segment?

Operating revenue consists of the following components:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Local currency revenue change is calculated by conforming 2021 results using 2020 exchange rates.

(2)Organic local currency revenue growth is defined as local currency revenue growth, adjusted to reflect an increase in prior year Equifax revenue from the revenue of acquired companies in the prior year period. This adjustment is made for 12 months following the acquisition.

10

2. What are the costs related to the technology transformation?

Costs related to the technology transformation are defined as incremental costs to transform our information technology infrastructure and data security. From January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020, these technology transformation costs were excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, technology transformation costs were included in our adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA. Technology transformation costs for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 are provided for comparability to prior periods. We recorded $46.8 million and $111.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively, for technology transformation costs. We recorded $167.4 million and $358.5 million for the full year 2021 and 2020, respectively, for technology transformation costs.

3. What is the estimate of the change in overall U.S. Mortgage Market transaction volume that is included in the 2022 first quarter and full year guidance provided?

Equifax estimates the change year over year in overall U.S. Mortgage Market transaction volume as being equal to the change in total U.S. mortgage credit inquiries received by Equifax. The change year over year in total U.S. mortgage credit inquiries received by Equifax in the first quarter of 2021 was an increase of 21%, the second quarter of 2021 was a decline of 5%, the third quarter of 2021 was a decline of 21% and the fourth quarter of 2021 was also a decline of 21%. The change year over year in total U.S. mortgage credit inquiries received by Equifax for the full year 2021 was a decline of 7.5%. The guidance provided on page 3 assumes a change year over year in total U.S. mortgage credit inquiries received by Equifax in the first quarter of 2022 to be a decline of approximately 24% and for the full year 2022 to be a decline of approximately 21.5%.

4. What is the impact of the GCS integration on operating segment performance?

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we integrated our Global Consumer Solutions business into our U.S. Information Solutions, Workforce Solutions and International operating segments. U.S. consumer credit monitoring solutions businesses have been moved into U.S. Information Solutions, with the remaining U.S. consumer identity theft protection business moved to Workforce Solutions. All international consumer credit monitoring solutions businesses in Canada and Europe have been moved into the International operating segment. In addition, certain costs related to legacy GCS platforms have been reclassified as expenses within our Corporate segment, as these platforms are now being utilized by multiple operating segments and are considered global in nature. For the fourth quarter and full year 2021, costs reclassified from our legacy GCS operating segment to our Corporate segment were $4.8 million and $16.9 million, respectively. These changes in operating segments align with how we manage our business as of the fourth quarter of 2021.

The change in operating segments has been applied retrospectively to our segment results for all periods presented within this earnings release. The following table reflects the impacts of the GCS integration on revenue, operating income, operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for all periods for 2020 and 2021. Year to date amounts may not equal the sum of all quarterly periods due to rounding.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures

Acquisition-related amortization expense, net of tax - During the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $56.8 million ($46.3 million, net of tax) and $36.0 million ($30.5 million net of tax), respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $176.4 million ($147.6 million net of tax) and $141.8 million ($120.6 million net of tax), respectively.

We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the material cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in material cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax. Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital.

Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident - Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident include legal fees to respond to subsequent litigation and government investigations. Through the year ended December 31, 2020, these costs also included incremental costs to transform our information technology, data security and infrastructure. During the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded pre-tax expense of $0.3 million ($0.3 million, net of tax) and a pre-tax net benefit of $0.1 million ($0.1 million, net of tax), respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and for year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded pre-tax expenses of $112.6 million ($82.3 million, net of tax) and $365.0 million ($270.5 million, net of tax), respectively. Management believes excluding these charges is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident do not include losses accrued for certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident.

Fair market value adjustment of equity investments - During the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2021 we recorded a $63.8 million ($40.8 million, net of tax) and $64.0 million ($41.1 million, net of tax) loss related to adjusting our investment in Brazil to fair value. For the fourth quarter of 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $13.3 million ($11.0 million, net of tax) loss and a $116.6 million ($74.8 million, net of tax) gain, respectively, related to adjusting our investment in Brazil to fair value. The investment had previously been recorded on our books at cost less impairment, as it did not have a readily determinable fair value. Subsequent to the initial public offering, our investment in Brazil has been adjusted to fair value, and will continue to be adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, with unrealized gains or losses to be recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other Income (Expense), net.

During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a $32.9 million ($26.3 million, net of tax) gain related to adjusting our equity method investment in India, in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining interest of our joint venture. Prior to the purchase of the remaining interest, Equifax did not have control over the joint venture. As a result of the transaction, Equifax recognized a gain related to the remeasurement of the preexisting equity interest in the India joint venture at the acquisition-date fair value of the business combination. Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, since the non-operating gains or losses are not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Pension mark-to-market fair value adjustment - We utilize a mark-to-market method of accounting for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Under our accounting methodology for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, remeasurement of projected benefit obligation and plan assets are immediately recognized in earnings through net periodic benefit cost within Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Income, with pension and postretirement plans to be remeasured annually in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events require remeasurement. During the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $20.2 million ($14.8 million, net of tax) loss related to the mark-to-market fair value adjustment of our pension and postretirement benefit plans. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a 

21

$32.2 million ($24.3 million, net of tax) loss related to the mark-to-market fair value adjustment of our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results, since the non-operating gains and losses are not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Income tax effects of Q1 2020 gain on fair market value adjustment of equity investment - During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a gain related to adjusting our equity method investment in India, in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining interest of our joint venture. Prior to the purchase of the remaining interest, Equifax did not have control over the joint venture. As a result of the transaction, Equifax recognized a gain related to the remeasurement of the preexisting equity interest in the India joint venture at the acquisition-date fair value of the business combination. Additional income tax effects related to this transaction were recorded each quarter of 2020. Management believes excluding this gain and related income tax effects from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for 2020, since the non-operating gain is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans - During the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $0.4 million foreign currency loss and a $4.3 million foreign currency gain, respectively, related to certain intercompany loans. The impact was recorded to the Other Income (Expense), net line item within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Acquisition-related costs other than acquisition amortization - During the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $8.9 million ($6.7 million, net of tax) and $19.1 million ($14.6 million, net of tax) for acquisition costs other than acquisition-related amortization. These costs primarily related to transaction and integration costs resulting from recent acquisitions and were recorded in operating income. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods.

Legal Settlement - During the third quarter of 2018, we recorded an $18.5 million ($14.1 million, net of tax) charge for legal fees and a legal settlement that was not related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. As of December 31, 2021, the claims period related to the settlement is over and we have recorded a true-up of $6.5 million ($4.9 million, net of tax) for the final settlement amount. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Charge related to the realignment of internal resources and other costs - During the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a restructuring charge of $8.6 million ($6.5 million, net of tax) and $31.9 million ($24.3 million, net of tax), respectively, related to the realignment of internal resources and other costs, which predominantly relates to the reduction of headcount and the realignment of our internal resources to support the Company’s strategic objectives and increase the integration of our global operations. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, since the charges are not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Income tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting or settlement - During the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a tax benefit of $4.9 million and $14.2 million, respectively, related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. During the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $3.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively, related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in 2020, because this amount is non-operating and relates to income tax benefits or deficiencies for stock awards recognized when tax amounts differ from recognized stock compensation cost. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

22

Argentina highly inflationary foreign currency adjustment - Argentina experienced multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates. As such, Argentina was deemed a highly inflationary economy by accounting policymakers. During the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.1 million and foreign currency gain of $0.8 million, related to the impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of Argentina being a highly inflationary economy. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.5 million. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets - During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a $7.0 million valuation allowance adjustment for deferred tax assets where the benefit is not expected to be realized. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for 2020 because this amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Tax benefit on a legal settlement related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident - During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a $4.8 million tax benefit on legal settlements related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, as finalization of the settlement terms in the first quarter caused us to conclude the tax treatment has changed from the time we recorded the initial loss. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin - Management defines adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income attributable to Equifax plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain one-time items. Management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.
