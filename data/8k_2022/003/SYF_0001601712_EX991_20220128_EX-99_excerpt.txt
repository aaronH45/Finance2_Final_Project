CFO COMMENTARY

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2021*

“Our fourth quarter financial results reflect the core strengths of our differentiated business model: our diversified partner portfolio; our scalable technology platform, which enables efficient and swift partner integrations and seamless omnichannel capabilities; our deep industry expertise and advanced analytics, and our digitally-enabled product suite, the combination of which powers compelling value and best-in-class experiences for our customers and partners,” said Brian Wenzel, Synchrony’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

“By leveraging these core strengths, Synchrony delivered a third consecutive quarter of double-digit purchase volume growth across four of our five platforms, as well as record purchase volume for the business. We did so while maintaining market-leading risk-adjusted returns and cost discipline and, in turn, produced record return on assets for the full year. 

“Synchrony is emerging from the pandemic with strong momentum, as the operating environment continues to normalize and we further advance our core differentiators, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the long-term operating metrics we laid out at Investor Day to drive considerable value for all our stakeholders.”

•Renewed seven programs including American Signature Furniture, City Furniture, and Husqvarna

•Invested in Skipify to expand innovative product offerings through additional distribution channels

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

EARNINGS GROWTH DRIVEN BY BROAD BASED STRENGTH ACROSS THE BUSINESS

•Net interest income increased $171 million, or 5%, to $3.8 billion.

•Retailer share arrangements increased $220 million, or 21%, to $1.3 billion, mainly driven by lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance.

•Provision for credit losses decreased $189 million, or 25%, to $561 million, driven by lower net charge-offs and lower reserve charge including amounts attributable to held for sale portfolios. 

•Other income increased $85 million, or 104%, to $167 million, primarily driven by gain in a venture investment.

•Other expense increased $122 million, or 12%, to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by asset impairments, certain incremental marketing investments, and higher employee costs. 

•Net earnings increased to $813 million, including a $74 million post-tax benefit, or $0.14 per diluted share, due to reserve reductions related to the held for sale portfolios.

CREDIT QUALITY

CREDIT PERFORMANCE CONTINUED TO BE DRIVEN BY A STRONG CONSUMER

•Loans 30+ days past due as a percentage of total period-end loan receivables were 2.62% compared to 3.07% last year, reflecting a decline of 45 basis points. Excluding the impact of the held for sale portfolios from both periods, the year over year decline was approximately 60 basis points.
