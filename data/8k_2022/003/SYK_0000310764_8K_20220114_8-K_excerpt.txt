ITEM 7.01REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE

Effective December 31, 2021, Stryker Corporation (the "Company") will segregate its operations into two reportable business segments: (i) MedSurg and Neurotechnology and (ii) Orthopaedics and Spine. This change realigns the Company's reportable business segments to its new internal reporting structure and how the Company manages its businesses as a result of the previously announced transition of responsibilities of President and Chief Operating Officer, Timothy J. Scannell, and the division of responsibilities between Group Presidents, J. Andrew Pierce (Group President, MedSurg and Neurotechnology) and Spencer S. Stiles (Group President, Orthopaedics and Spine).

For informational purposes, included in Exhibit 99.1 to this report is the Company's recast historical product sales information that reflects the segment change noted above.

The information furnished in this report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
