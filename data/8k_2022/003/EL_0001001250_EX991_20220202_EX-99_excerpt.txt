THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES REPORTS OUTSTANDING

FISCAL 2022 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

Net Sales Increased 14% and Diluted EPS Rose 25% to $2.97

Organic Net Sales1 Grew 11% and Adjusted Diluted EPS Increased 15% in Constant Currency

All Engines Ignited Reflecting Recovery in Western Markets 

Raising Full Year Outlook

New York, February 3, 2022 - The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE: EL) today reported net sales of $5.54 billion for its second quarter ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 14% from $4.85 billion in the prior-year period. Net sales grew in every region and product category, reflecting early stages of recovery in brick-and-mortar retail stores, primarily in western markets, and strength in online2. These results reflected robust consumer response to holiday offerings and during key shopping moments. Organic net sales increased 11%. 

The Company reported net earnings of $1.09 billion, compared with net earnings of $0.87 billion in the prior-year period. Diluted net earnings per common share was $2.97, compared with $2.37 reported in the prior-year period. Excluding restructuring and other charges and adjustments as detailed on page 3, adjusted diluted earnings per common share was $3.01, a 15% increase on both a reported basis and in constant currency.  

Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer said, “We achieved record sales and profitability in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, empowered by the timeless desirability of our brands and despite accelerated volatility and variability, as well as supply chain challenges, from the pandemic. Every category, region and major channel expanded, showcasing the strength of our multiple engines of growth strategy. We seized the favorable dynamics of Skin Care, Fragrance, developed markets in the West, and brick-and-mortar, and continued to prosper in the East with Chinese consumers as well as in global Travel Retail and global Online.” 

Freda emphasized, “Our brands excelled in the key shopping moments of 11.11 and Holiday,

welcoming new consumers and serving loyal consumers with festive exclusives, highly-sought hero products, enticing innovation, and elevated high-touch services in-store and online."

1 Organic net sales represents net sales excluding returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures; as well as the impacts from currency. We believe the Non-GAAP measure of organic net sales growth provides year-over-year sales comparisons on a consistent basis. See page 3 for reconciliations to GAAP.

2 Online sales discussed throughout includes sales of our products from our websites and third-party platforms, as well as estimated sales of our products sold through our retailers’ websites.

Freda concluded, “As we embark on the second half of fiscal 2022, our business is far bigger and more profitable than pre-pandemic with every region larger. This reinforces our confidence in our ability to navigate the impacts of the prolonged pandemic. We are raising our fiscal 2022 full year outlook, as we reflect our outstanding results to-date and are mindful of the risks of continued volatility and disruption in the second half of the year.”

COVID-19 Business Update 

The COVID-19 pandemic continued to disrupt the Company’s operating environment, impacting retail traffic and consumer preferences in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The spread of the Delta and Omicron variants and resurgence of COVID-19 cases in most parts of the world led to periodic point-of-sale staffing shortages as well as government restrictions to prevent further spread of the virus. These restrictions included the intermittent closure of businesses deemed non-essential, curtailment of travel, social distancing, vaccination requirements for brick-and-mortar businesses, and quarantines.

Retail Impact

While most brick-and-mortar retail stores globally that sell the Company’s products, whether operated by the Company or its customers, were open during much of the second quarter of fiscal 2022, there were intermittent closures throughout the world due to safety protocols or restrictions. In much of Asia/Pacific, restrictions eased during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, although mainland China had regional lockdowns and much of Western Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom, experienced increased restrictions as the quarter progressed. In North America in late calendar year 2021, restrictions and store closures varied by location. COVID-19 cases generally eased in Latin America. Globally, in areas where stores were open, consumer traffic has not recovered to the pre-pandemic levels. 

International passenger traffic remained largely curtailed globally. However, passenger traffic in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and The Americas improved but remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels. The improvement was due to the partial lifting of government restrictions, most notably in the United Kingdom and the United States. In Asia/Pacific, increased travel restrictions remained in place during much of the quarter, and traffic in Hainan was negatively impacted by fewer visitors due to intermittent domestic travel restrictions. 

Consumer Preferences

The COVID-19 pandemic-related closures of offices, retail stores and other businesses and the

significant decline in social gatherings have influenced consumer preferences and practices. While the demand for makeup improved significantly versus the prior year, it continues to be the only category that remains below the pre-pandemic period, given fewer makeup usage occasions and ongoing mask wearing, while skin care, fragrance and hair care have all grown from pre-pandemic levels.

Supply Chain

The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to global supply chain disruptions, including manufacturing and transportation delays, due to closures, employee absences, port congestion, labor and container shortages, and shipment delays. As a result, the Company expects higher costs to negatively impact cost of sales and operating expenses for the remainder of fiscal 2022. The Company expects to mitigate some of the impact to its business and costs through strategic price increases, product mix, timing of shipments, use of air freight and less congested ports, and cost savings in other areas.

Outlook for Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter and Full Year

The Company is raising its full fiscal year outlook, reflecting both outstanding performance to date and the risks of continued volatility and disruptions in the second half of the year.

With multiple engines of growth across regions, brands, product categories and channels, the

Company is well-positioned to continue to drive a gradual recovery as macro-conditions

and market dynamics support it. The Company expects to invest in areas to support

the recovery, including advertising, online, research and development and supply chain, to drive growth in areas of opportunity and help nurture emerging trends in the rest of the business.

The full year outlook reflects the following assumptions:

•Global volatility and variability is expected to continue, including inflation, supply chain disruption and COVID-19 restrictions. The Company believes it can continue to manage through this uncertain environment while driving multiple engines of growth.

•A continued recovery of the makeup and hair care categories as countries reduce COVID-19 restrictions.

•Growth in developed markets in the west and in brick-and-mortar retail.

•Targeted new distribution throughout the year to retailers that provide broader consumer reach.

•A continued gradual resumption of international travel.

•Benefit from a nearly full year incremental impact of DECIEM in net sales and operating results.

•Higher transportation and logistics costs are expected to negatively impact both cost of sales and operating expenses in the remainder of fiscal 2022. The Company expects to mitigate some of the impact to its business and costs through strategic price increases, timing of shipments and cost savings in other areas.

•Incremental savings from the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program and reinvestment in advertising and capabilities.

•Full-year effective tax rate of approximately 22%.

The Company is mindful of ongoing risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as risks related to

social, economic and political matters, including restructurings and bankruptcies in the retail industry,

geopolitical tensions, regulatory developments, global security issues, currency volatility, general

economic challenges, including increasing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, and changes in consumer preferences that affect consumer spending in certain countries, channels and travel corridors.

Longer-term, the Company expects to return to its growth targets of 6% to 8% sales growth, 50 basis

points of operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in

constant currency after a period of normalization as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic subside.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2022

Sales Outlook

•Reported net sales are forecasted to increase between 10% and 12% versus the prior-year period.

(B)For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $2 million (gross and net of tax) of acquisition-related stock option expense related to DECIEM stock options. The Company recorded $2 million (gross and net of tax) of income within selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020 to reflect changes in the fair value of its contingent consideration related to its fiscal 2016 acquisition.

This earnings release includes some non-GAAP financial measures relating to charges associated with restructuring and other activities and relating to organic net sales. Included herein are reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measures for certain consolidated statements of earnings accounts before and after these items. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate its operating performance, which represent the way the Company conducts and views its business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or do not reflect the Company’s underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze operating performance from period to period. In the future, the Company expects to incur charges or make adjustments similar in nature to those presented herein; however, the impact to the Company’s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies. While the Company considers the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP.

The Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of its net sales generated outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the Company’s results of operations. Therefore, the Company presents certain net sales, operating results and diluted earnings per share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of its underlying business outside the United States. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current-period results using prior-year period monthly average foreign currency exchange rates and adjusting for the period-over-period impact of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities.
