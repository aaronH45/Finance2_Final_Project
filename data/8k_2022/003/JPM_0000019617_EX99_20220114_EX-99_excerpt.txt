Notes on non-GAAP financial measures 1. rat Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a lement 2. ews these metrics excluding CIB Markets. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
