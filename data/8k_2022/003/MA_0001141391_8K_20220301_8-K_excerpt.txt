Item 8.01 Other Events

In response to the invasion of Ukraine, and pursuant to the actions taken by governments around the world in response, Mastercard is working to comply with all required restrictions. 

Our first priority is the well-being of our employees and their families. We are also actively monitoring the stability and security of our operations. 

While our global business fundamentals remain strong, Russia and Ukraine are important contributors to our overall company net revenues. As a point of reference, in 2021, about 4% of our net revenues were derived from business conducted within, into and out of Russia, and similarly approximately 2% of our net revenues were related to Ukraine. Given the rapidly changing developments in these markets, we continue to monitor and assess the impact of current and potential future actions of governments and others on our operations, including potential balance sheet and settlement-related exposures.
