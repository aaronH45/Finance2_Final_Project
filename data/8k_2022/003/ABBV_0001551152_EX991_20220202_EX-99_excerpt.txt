Recent Events

•AbbVie confirmed prior revenue guidance of greater than $15 billion in combined Skyrizi (risankizumab) and Rinvoq (upadacitinib) risk-adjusted sales in 2025. AbbVie expects each asset to deliver risk-adjusted sales of greater than $7.5 billion in 2025. Skyrizi is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally.

•AbbVie announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Rinvoq for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose disease did not respond to previous treatment and is not well controlled with other pills or injections, including biologic medicines, or when use of other pills or injections is not recommended. The approval includes two dose strengths (15 mg and 30 mg, once daily) and is supported by efficacy and safety data from one of the largest registrational Phase 3 programs for AD with more than 2,500 patients evaluated across three studies. This milestone marked the third FDA-approved indication for Rinvoq.

•AbbVie announced the FDA approved Rinvoq (15 mg, once daily) for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. The approval is supported by two Phase 3 clinical studies where Rinvoq showed efficacy across multiple measures of disease activity in active PsA with a safety profile consistent with that seen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This milestone marked the second FDA-approved indication for Rinvoq.

•AbbVie announced the FDA approved Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with active PsA. The approval is supported by two Phase 3 clinical studies where Skyrizi demonstrated significant improvement in joint symptoms, including swollen, tender and painful joints, compared to placebo. This milestone marked the second FDA-approved indication for Skyrizi.

•AbbVie announced the European Commission (EC) approved Skyrizi alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of active PsA in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The positive opinion is based on data from two pivotal Phase 3 studies which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Skyrizi in adults with active PsA and marks Skyrizi’s second indication in the European Union (EU). 

•AbbVie announced that it submitted applications to the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval for Rinvoq (15 mg, once daily) for the treatment of adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). The submissions are supported by the Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 (study 2) clinical trial in which Rinvoq demonstrated significant improvements in signs and symptoms as well as physical function and disease activity versus placebo. No new safety risks were observed compared to the known safety profile of Rinvoq. In addition, AbbVie requested label enhancements for Rinvoq in the EU to include adult patients with active AS who had an inadequate response to biologic DMARDs, based on newly generated clinical data. These data were also provided to the FDA in support of the agency’s ongoing review of the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Rinvoq in AS.

•AbbVie announced that it submitted an application to the EMA seeking approval for Skyrizi (600 mg intravenous induction and 360 mg subcutaneous maintenance therapy) for the treatment of patients 16 years and older with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD). The submission is supported by three pivotal Phase 3 studies in which Skyrizi demonstrated significant improvements in clinical remission and endoscopic response as both induction and maintenance therapy. The overall safety findings in these pivotal studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Skyrizi. If approved, CD will mark the third indication for Skyrizi in the EU.

•AbbVie announced positive top-line results from the Phase 3 induction study, U-EXCEED, which showed Rinvoq (45 mg, once daily) achieved both primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response at week 12 as well as key secondary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe CD. The safety results in this study were consistent with the known profile of Rinvoq, with no new safety risks observed. U-EXCEED is the first of two Phase 3 induction studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Rinvoq in adults with moderate to severe CD and full results from the study will be presented at a future medical meeting and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Recent Events (Continued)

•At the American College of Rheumatology’s (ACR) annual meeting, AbbVie shared 38 abstracts from across its rheumatology portfolio that underscored AbbVie's commitment to advancing its portfolio of medicines to help more people living with rheumatic diseases. Highlights included new efficacy data on Rinvoq in people with active PsA and axial involvement, new long-term analysis evaluating the sustainability of response to Rinvoq among patients with RA as well as efficacy and safety data from the KEEPsAKE 1 and KEEPsAKE 2 trials evaluating Skyrizi in adults with PsA treated through 24 weeks.

•AbbVie announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to investigational telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso-V) for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild type, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high levels of c-Met overexpression whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based therapy. The BTD is supported by interim data from the ongoing Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study and a Phase 3 study is planned to begin in the first half of 2022.

•At the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting (ASH), AbbVie presented results from nearly 30 abstracts across 8 types of cancer. Highlights included data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE and Phase 3 GLOW studies evaluating minimal residual disease (MRD) and disease-free survival outcomes with fixed duration treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) who received the Imbruvica (ibrutinib) + Venclexta (venetoclax) combination regimen; results from several studies evaluating Venclexta in approved and investigational indications; as well as data evaluating ABBV-383, epcoritamab and lemzoparlimab. Venetoclax is being developed by AbbVie and Roche and is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. Imbruvica is jointly developed and commercialized with Janssen Biotech, Inc. Epcoritamab is being co-developed by Genmab and AbbVie. Lemzoparlimab is being developed through a collaboration with AbbVie and I-Mab.

•Allergan Aesthetics announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Soliton, Inc. The addition of Soliton and its technology complements Allergan Aesthetics' portfolio of non-invasive body contouring treatments to now include a proven treatment for the appearance of cellulite.

•At the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery meeting, Allergan Aesthetics presented 6 abstracts from its leading portfolio of aesthetic treatments and products, which highlighted its approach to innovative science and commitment to bring new and impactful treatments to customers and patients globally. Highlights included two Botox Cosmetic (OnabotulinumtoxinA) abstracts that were recognized as “Best of Cosmetic Oral Abstracts”.

•AbbVie announced the FDA approved Vuity (pilocarpine HCl ophthalmic solution) 1.25% for the treatment of presbyopia, commonly known as age-related blurry near vision, in adults. Vuity is the first and only FDA-approved eye drop to treat this common and progressive eye condition that affects nearly half of the U.S. adult population. The approval is supported by two pivotal Phase 3 studies that demonstrated Vuity works in as early as 15 minutes and lasts for up to 6 hours, as measured on day 30, to improve near and intermediate vision without impacting distance vision.

•At the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting (AAO), AbbVie presented new data from its leading eye care portfolio. Highlights included new pooled post-hoc analyses and patient-reported outcomes of Vuity 1.25%, analyses on Durysta (bimatoprost intracameral implant) and 3 real-world data studies on the glaucoma patient journey.

•AbbVie announced that it has extended its preclinical oncology research collaboration agreement with the University of Chicago through 2025. Under the agreement, the organizations will continue working together to advance research in several areas, focusing on oncology, and AbbVie gains an option for an exclusive license to certain University of Chicago discoveries made as part of the collaboration.
