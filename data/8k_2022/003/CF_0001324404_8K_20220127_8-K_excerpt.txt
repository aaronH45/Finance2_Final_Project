The supplement in the case of each series of Notes provided for amendments of the applicable indenture to remove CF Industries’ United Kingdom subsidiaries from the definition of Significant Subsidiary (as defined in such indenture) and from being considered to be part of a group of subsidiaries of CF Industries that would, taken together, constitute a Significant Subsidiary of CF Industries. In the case of each series of Notes, CFI received consent to such amendments from holders of a majority of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes. The amendments in the case of each series of Notes became operative on February 1, 2022, upon payment by CFI of a consent fee to the consenting holders of such series of Notes.

An affiliate of Computershare is the transfer agent and registrar for CF Industries’ common stock. 

On January 27, 2022, CF Industries and CFI entered into that certain Amendment No. 1 to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2022 (the “Credit Agreement Amendment”), with the lenders party thereto, the issuing banks party thereto and Citibank, N.A.

The Credit Agreement Amendment also (i) changed the threshold above which a subsidiary would constitute a Material Subsidiary from 5% of the consolidated total assets of CF Industries and its subsidiaries to 10% of consolidated total assets of CF Industries and its subsidiaries and (ii) replaced the threshold above which a subsidiary would constitute a Material Subsidiary from 5% of consolidated gross sales of CF Industries and its subsidiaries to 10% of consolidated EBITDA of CF Industries and its subsidiaries. Furthermore, the Credit Agreement Amendment changed the reference rate for (i) borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement denominated in Euros from LIBOR to EURIBOR and (ii) borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement denominated in Sterling from LIBOR to SONIA.
