Commences Strategic Review of Netspend Consumer Business

Increases Share Repurchase Authorization to $2.0 Billion

ATLANTA -- Global Payments Inc. (NYSE: GPN) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021.

“We are pleased with the resilience that our businesses demonstrated during the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the full year,” said Jeff Sloan, Chief Executive Officer. “We are particularly proud of the sequential improvement in our Merchant Solutions business this quarter, despite the incremental impact of COVID-19 throughout the period. We reported the best results in our history in 2021, and we expect 2022 to exceed that performance as we continue to meaningfully advance our differentiated strategies for growth.

“We are thrilled to announce that Global Payments is the finalist company in Caixabank’s selection process for a technology partner for its card issuing businesses. During the coming weeks we expect to finalize contract negotiations. Upon implementation in conjunction with our recently announced partnership with Virgin Money, we believe that Global Payments will be among the leading debit technology providers across Europe.”

Sloan continued, “In addition to our selection by Caixa and the announcement of our collaboration with Virgin Money, we achieved many other significant accomplishments over the past twelve months despite a highly uncertain environment. This includes our partnership with Google to deliver innovative and seamless digital services to all manner of merchants worldwide; the expansion of our relationship with AWS for unique distribution and cutting-edge issuer technologies; our successful acquisitions of Zego and MineralTree to advance our software leadership position; and our partnership with Mercedes-Benz Stadium to enable its multi-channel commerce ecosystem and provide best-in-class experiences for fans.

“It has been an active period for capital management with more than $6 billion deployed since 2020 to expand our target addressable markets while concurrently returning capital to shareholders. Our free cash flow conversion and balance sheet provide us with ample firepower to continue to execute on our priorities.”

Sloan concluded, “At the same time, we seek to refine our portfolio mix by simplifying the composition of our businesses and maintaining a singular focus on our corporate customers. As part of that initiative, we have commenced a strategic review of the Netspend consumer business; we intend to retain its B2B assets as we further expand this new pillar of our strategy.”

OUTLOOK SUMMARY (UNAUDITED) 

GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

(In billions, except per share data) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Represents adjustments to revenues for gross-up related payments (included in operating expenses) associated with certain lines of business to reflect economic benefit to the company. Amounts also include adjustments to eliminate the effect of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments for software-related contract liabilities associated with acquired businesses.

(2)Adjustments to 2021 GAAP diluted EPS include the removal of 1) software-related contract liability adjustments described above of $0.02, 2) acquisition related amortization expense of $3.39, 3) share-based compensation expense of $0.47, 4) acquisition and integration expense of $0.89, 5) facilities exit charges of $0.15, 6) other items of $(0.1), 7) equity method investment earnings from our interest in a private equity investment fund of $(0.16) and 8) discrete tax items of $0.12. Adjustments to 2021 GAAP diluted EPS include the effect on noncontrolling interests and income taxes, as applicable.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Global Payments supplements revenues, income, operating income, operating margin and EPS determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP by providing these measures with certain adjustments (such measures being non-GAAP financial measures) in this document to assist with evaluating our performance. In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to focus on the factors the company believes are pertinent to the daily management of our operations. Management believes adjusted net revenue more closely reflects the economic benefits to the company's core business and allows for better comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, together with other metrics, to set goals for and measure the performance of the business and to determine incentive compensation. Adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, revenues, operating income, net income and EPS determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Adjusted net revenue excludes gross-up related payments associated with certain lines of business to reflect economic benefits to the company. On a GAAP basis, these payments are presented gross in both revenues and operating expenses. Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude acquisition-related amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration expense and other items specific to each reporting period as more fully described in the accompanying reconciliations in Schedules 6 and 7. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenue. Adjusted net revenue and adjusted EPS range on a constant currency basis excludes the estimated impact of foreign currency fluctuations and is calculated using average exchange rates during 2021. The tax rate used in determining the income tax impact of earnings adjustments is either the jurisdictional statutory rate in effect at the time of the adjustment or the jurisdictional expected annual effective tax rate for the period, depending on the nature and timing of the adjustment.
