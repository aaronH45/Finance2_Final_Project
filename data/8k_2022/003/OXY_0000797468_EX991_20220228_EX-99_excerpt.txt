   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  The Acceptance Priority Levels will operate concurrently but separately with respect to the Pool 1 Notes and the Pool 2 Notes. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offers described in the Offer to Purchase, if the Pool 1 Maximum Consideration Condition or the Pool 2 Maximum Consideration Condition, as applicable, is not satisfied with respect to every Series of Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes, as applicable, Occidental will accept the Pool 1 Notes and the Pool 2 Notes for purchase in the order of their respective Acceptance Priority Level specified in the tables above (each, an “Acceptance Priority Level,” with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level for both Pools and 8 and 7 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level with respect to the Pool 1 Notes and the Pool 2 Notes, respectively). It is possible that a Series of Notes with a particular Acceptance Priority Level will not be accepted for purchase even if one or more Series with a higher or lower Acceptance Priority Level in such Pool are accepted for purchase. If any Series of Notes is accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers, all Notes of that Series that are validly tendered will be accepted for purchase. No Series of Notes will be subject to proration.    

 (2)  Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the Offers (exclusive of any accrued and unpaid interest, which will be paid in addition to the Purchase Price, from, and including, the last interest payment date for the relevant Series of Notes up to, but excluding, the Settlement Date (as defined below) (“Accrued Interest”)).    

Subject to the Pool 1 Maximum Purchase Price or the Pool 2 Maximum Purchase Price, as applicable, the application of the Acceptance Priority Levels and the other terms and conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, Occidental intends to accept for purchase all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Time. The applicable Purchase Price for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase will be determined as set forth in the tables above. Holders who validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Notes at or prior to the Expiration Time will be eligible to receive the applicable Purchase Price.

Consummation of the Offers and payment for the Notes accepted for purchase are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, including the Pool 1 Maximum Consideration Condition (as defined below) and the Pool 2 Maximum Consideration Condition (as defined below), as well as other customary conditions. Subject to applicable law, Occidental has reserved the absolute right, in its sole discretion, at any time, to (i) waive any and all conditions to the Offers, including the Pool 1 Maximum Consideration Condition and/or the Pool 2 Maximum Consideration Condition, with or without extending the Withdrawal Time, (ii) extend, terminate, or withdraw any Offer or the Offers, (iii) increase or waive the Pool 1 Maximum Purchase Price and/or the Pool 2 Maximum Purchase Price, with or without extending the Withdrawal Time, or (iv) otherwise amend the Offers in any respect. 

Occidental’s obligation to complete an Offer with respect to a particular Series of Pool 1 Notes validly tendered is conditioned on the aggregate Purchase Price for the Offers, excluding the Accrued Interest with respect to each Series of Notes (the “Aggregate Purchase Price”) with respect to the Pool 1 Notes, not exceeding the Pool 1 Maximum Purchase Price, and on the Pool 1 Maximum Purchase Price being sufficient to pay the Aggregate Purchase Price for all validly tendered Notes of such Series (after paying the Pool 1 Aggregate Purchase Price for all validly tendered Pool 1 Notes that have a higher Acceptance Priority Level) (the “Pool 1 Maximum Consideration Condition”). 

Occidental’s obligation to complete an Offer with respect to a particular Series of Pool 2 Notes validly tendered is conditioned on the Aggregate Purchase Price for the Offers with respect to the Pool 2 Notes not exceeding the Pool 2 Maximum Purchase Price, and on the Pool 2 Maximum Purchase Price being sufficient to pay the Pool 2 Aggregate Purchase Price for all validly tendered Notes of such Series (after paying the Pool 2 Aggregate Purchase Price for all validly tendered Pool 2 Notes that have a higher Acceptance Priority Level) (the “Pool 2 Maximum Consideration Condition”). 

If the Pool 1 Maximum Consideration Condition is not satisfied with respect to each Series of Pool 1 Notes, for (i) a Series of Pool 1 Notes (the “First Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes”) for which the Pool 1 Maximum Purchase Price is less than the sum of (x) the Pool 1 Aggregate Purchase Price for all validly tendered First Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes and (y) the Pool 1 Aggregate Purchase Price for all validly tendered Pool 1 Notes of all Series having a higher Acceptance Priority Level than the First Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes (with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 8 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level with respect to the Pool 1 Notes), and (ii) all Series of Pool 1 Notes with an Acceptance Priority Level lower than the First Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes (together with the First Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes, the “Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes”), then Occidental may, at any time on or prior to the Expiration Time: 

   (a)  terminate an Offer with respect to one or more Series of Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes for which the Pool 1 Maximum Consideration Condition has not been satisfied, and promptly return all validly tendered Notes of such Series, and any other Series of Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes, to the respective tendering Holders; or

   (b)  waive the Pool 1 Maximum Consideration Condition with respect to one or more Series of Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes and accept all Notes of such Series, and of any Series of Pool 1 Notes having a higher Acceptance Priority Level, validly tendered; or    

   (c)  if there is any Series of Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes with a lower Acceptance Priority Level than the First Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes for which:    

   (i)  the Aggregate Purchase Price necessary to purchase all validly tendered Notes of such Series, plus    

   (ii)  the Aggregate Purchase Price necessary to purchase all validly tendered Pool 1 Notes of all Series having a higher Acceptance Priority Level than such Series of Notes, other than any Series of Non-Covered Pool 1 Notes that has or have not also been accepted as contemplated by this clause (c),    

is equal to, or less than, the Pool 1 Maximum Purchase Price, accept all validly tendered Pool 1 Notes of all such Series having a lower Acceptance Priority Level, until there is no Series of Pool 1 Notes with a higher or lower Acceptance Priority Level to be considered for purchase for which the conditions set forth above are met. 

If the Pool 2 Maximum Consideration Condition is not satisfied with respect to each Series of Pool 2 Notes, for (i) a Series of Pool 2 Notes (the “First Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes”) for which the Pool 2 Maximum Purchase Price is less than the sum of (x) the Pool 2 Aggregate Purchase Price for all validly tendered First Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes and (y) the Pool 2 Aggregate Purchase Price for all validly tendered Pool 2 Notes of all Series having a higher Acceptance Priority Level than the First Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes (with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 7 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level with respect to the Pool 2 Notes), and (ii) all Series of Pool 2 Notes with an Acceptance Priority Level lower than the First Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes (together with the First Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes, the “Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes”), then Occidental may, at any time on or prior to the Expiration Time: 

   (a)  terminate an Offer with respect to one or more Series of Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes for which the Pool 2 Maximum Consideration Condition has not been satisfied, and promptly return all validly tendered Notes of such Series, and any other Series of Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes, to the respective tendering Holders; or    

   (b)  waive the Pool 2 Maximum Consideration Condition with respect to one or more Series of Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes and accept all Notes of such Series, and of any Series of Pool 2 Notes having a higher Acceptance Priority Level, validly tendered; or    

   (c)  if there is any Series of Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes with a lower Acceptance Priority Level than the First Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes for which:    

   (i)  the Aggregate Purchase Price necessary to purchase all validly tendered Notes of such Series, plus    

   (ii)  the Aggregate Purchase Price necessary to purchase all validly tendered Pool 2 Notes of all Series having a higher Acceptance Priority Level than such Series of Notes, other than any Series of Non-Covered Pool 2 Notes that has or have not also been accepted as contemplated by this clause (c),

The Acceptance Priority Levels will operate concurrently but separately for the Pool 1 Notes and the Pool 2 Notes. It is possible that a Series of Notes with a particular Acceptance Priority Level will fail to meet the conditions set forth above and therefore will not be accepted for purchase even if one or more Series with a higher or lower Acceptance Priority Level in the applicable Pool are accepted for purchase. 

Settlement for Notes (i) validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Time or delivered pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures described in the Offer the Purchase and (ii) accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers is expected to occur on March 9, 2022, unless extended by Occidental in its sole discretion (the “Settlement Date”). 

In addition to the Purchase Price, all Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers, will, on the Settlement Date, also receive Accrued Interest in respect of such Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, Accrued Interest will cease to accrue on the Settlement Date for all Notes accepted in the Offers.
