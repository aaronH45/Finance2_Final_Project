 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

In addition to the results provided in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), the Company provides the following non-GAAP measurements.

•Diluted Earnings Per Share ("EPS") excluding Special Items (as defined below);

•Effective Tax Rate excluding Special Items;

•Core Operating Profit. Core Operating Profit excludes Special Items and FX and we use Core Operating Profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally.

•Company restaurant profit and Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales (as defined below).

These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.

Special Items are not included in any of our Division segment results as the Company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature. Our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of Special Items when assessing segment performance. The Special Items are described in (a) - (i) in the accompanying notes.

Company restaurant profit is defined as Company sales less Company restaurant expenses, both of which appear on the face of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Company restaurant expenses include those expenses incurred directly by our Company-owned restaurants in generating Company sales, including cost of food and paper, cost of restaurant-level labor, rent, depreciation and amortization of restaurant-level assets and advertising expenses incurred by and on behalf of that Company restaurant. Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales ("Company restaurant margin %") is defined as Company restaurant profit divided by Company sales. We use Company restaurant profit for the purposes of internally evaluating the performance of our Company-owned restaurants and we believe Company restaurant profit provides useful information to investors as to the profitability of our Company-owned restaurants. In calculating Company restaurant profit, the Company excludes revenues and expenses directly associated with our franchise operations as well as non-restaurant-level costs included in General and administrative expenses, some of which may support Company-owned restaurant operations. The Company also excludes restaurant-level asset impairment and closures expenses, which have historically not been significant, from the determination of Company restaurant profit as such expenses are not believed to be indicative of ongoing operations. Company restaurant profit and Company restaurant margin % as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the industry.

Certain non-GAAP measurements are presented excluding the impact of FX. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the FX impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Consolidated Balance Sheets

and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

(amounts in millions)

(unaudited)

Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021 are preliminary.

(a)Due to their size and volatility, we have reflected as Special Items those refranchising gains and losses that were recorded in connection with our previously announced plans to have at least 98% franchise restaurant ownership by the end of 2018. As such, refranchising gains and losses recorded during 2021 and 2020 as Special Items are directly associated with restaurants that were refranchised prior to the end of 2018.

During the quarters ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net refranchising losses of $1 million and less than $1 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net refranchising gains of $3 million and $8 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items.

Additionally, during the quarters ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net refranchising gains of $15 million and $4 million, respectively, that have not been reflected as Special Items. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net refranchising gains of $32 million and $26 million, respectively, that have not been reflected as Special Items. These gains relate to refranchising of restaurants in 2021 and 2020 that were not part of our aforementioned plans to achieve 98% franchise ownership and that we believe are now more indicative of our expected ongoing refranchising activity.

(b)During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, we recorded Special Item charges of $4 million to Other (income) expense related to the integration of The Habit Restaurants, Inc. (“Habit”). 

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded Special Item charges of $4 million to Other (income) expense and $9 million to General and administrative expenses, respectively, related to the acquisition and integration of Habit.

(c)On March 18, 2020 we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Habit for total cash consideration of $408 million, net of cash acquired. During the first-quarter of 2020 the operations of substantially all Habit restaurants were impacted by government recommendations and mandates arising from containment and mitigation measures related to the COVID-19 global pandemic. As a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Habit’s results through March 31, 2020 as well as general market conditions, during the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $139 million to Other (income) expense. As we continued to refine our preliminary purchase price allocation for Habit in the quarter ended September 30, 2020 the impairment charge was adjusted upward by $5 million. These impairment charges have been reflected as Special Items. We have also reflected the tax benefit of these impairment charges, which totaled $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a Special Item.

(d)On June 24, 2020, the YUM! Brands, Inc. Board of Directors approved the establishment of the company's new global "Unlocking Opportunity Initiative" including a $100 million investment over the next five years to fight inequality by unlocking opportunities for employees, restaurant team members and communities. The Company contributed $50 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2020 to Yum! Brands Foundation, Inc. (a stand-alone, not-for-profit organization that is not consolidated in the Company's results) as part of these efforts and investment. As a result of the size and specific nature of this contribution, we reflected the associated General and administrative expense as a Special Item.

(e)During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Company made a contribution of $25 million to Yum! Brands Foundation, Inc. to fund past and anticipated payments for COVID relief provided to restaurant-level employees within the YUM system. As a result of the size and specific nature of this contribution, we have reflected the associated General and administrative expense as a Special Item.

(f)During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a charge of $2 million to Other (income) expense and during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we recorded charges of $4 million to General and administrative expenses and $1 million to Other pension (income) expense related to a resource optimization program initiated in the third quarter of 2020. 

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded charges of $7 million to General and administrative expenses and $2 million to Other (income) expense and we recorded a credit of $1 million to Other pension (income) expense related to this resource optimization program. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded charges of $36 million to 

19

General and administrative expenses and $2 million to Other pension (income) expense related to this resource optimization program. 

This program is part of our efforts to optimize our resources, reallocating them toward critical areas of the business that will drive future growth. These critical areas include accelerating our digital, technology and innovation capabilities to deliver a modern, world-class team member and customer experience and improve unit economics. Due to the size and scope of the resource optimization program, these amounts have been reflected as Special Items.

(g)During the quarter ended June 30, 2021, certain subsidiaries of the Company redeemed $1,050 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Subsidiary Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). The redemption amount was equal to 102.625% of the $1,050 million aggregate principal amount redeemed, reflecting a $28 million “call premium”. We recognized the call premium and the write-off of $6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2026 Notes within Interest expense, net which we reflected as Special Items due to their collective size and the fact that the amounts are not indicative of our ongoing interest expense. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, KFC Holding Co., Pizza Hut Holdings, LLC and Taco Bell of America, LLC, each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued a notice of redemption for $1,050 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Subsidiary Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2024 (the "2024 Notes"). The redemption amount included a $26 million call premium plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption of October 9, 2020. We recorded the call premium, $6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2024 Notes and $2 million of accrued and unpaid interest associated with the period of time from prepayment of the 2024 Notes with the Trustee on September 25, 2020, to their redemption date within Interest expense, net and reflected the charges as Special Items due to their collective size and the fact that the amounts are not indicative of our ongoing interest expense.

(h)Tax (Expense) Benefit on Special Items was determined based upon the impact of the nature, as well as the jurisdiction of the respective individual components within Special Items. Additionally, during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded as a Special Item a $2 million tax expense and a $8 million tax benefit, respectively, related to prior refranchisings for which the associated pre-tax gain or loss was recorded as Special.

(i)In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property ("IP") rights. As a result of the transfer of certain of these rights, largely to subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (“UK”), we received a step-up in tax basis to current fair value under applicable tax law. To the extent this step-up in tax basis was amortizable against future taxable income we recognized a significant one-time deferred tax benefit in 2019 as a Special Item. Additionally, we recognized a related deferred tax benefit of $3 million as a Special Item in the quarter ended December 31, 2020.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the UK Finance Act 2020 was enacted resulting in an increase in the UK corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19%. As a result, in the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we remeasured the deferred tax assets originally recorded as a Special Item as described above and recognized an additional $25 million deferred tax benefit as a Special Item.

During the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the UK Finance Act 2021 was enacted resulting in an increase in the UK corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%. As a result, in the quarter ended June 30, 2021, we remeasured the deferred tax assets originally recorded as a Special Item as described above and recognized an additional $64 million deferred tax benefit as a Special Item. 

In July 2021, we concentrated management responsibility for European (excluding the UK) KFC franchise development, support operations and management oversight in Switzerland (the “KFC Europe Reorganization”). Concurrent with this change in management responsibility, we have completed intra-entity transfers of certain KFC IP rights from subsidiaries in the UK to subsidiaries in Switzerland. With the transfers of these rights, we received a step-up in amortizable tax basis to current fair value under applicable Swiss tax law. As a result of this transfer, we recorded a net one-time tax benefit of $152 million as a Special Item in the quarter ended September 30, 2021.

In December 2021, we continued our KFC Europe Reorganization and completed intra-entity transfers of additional European KFC IP rights from subsidiaries in the U.S. to subsidiaries in Switzerland. With the transfers of these additional rights, we received a step-up in amortizable tax basis to current fair value under applicable Swiss tax law. As a result of this transfer, we recorded a net one-time tax benefit of $35 million as a Special Item in the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
