We continually monitor the competitive landscape in our industry and have been extremely pleased with our ability to grow both our DIY and professional business at record levels over the last two years; however, we believe we have an opportunity to accelerate our professional share gain through targeted competitive adjustments to our pricing strategy. We have incorporated our expectations for continued robust demand on both sides of our business and the anticipated sales lift from our professional pricing initiative in establishing our 2022 comparable store sales guidance range of 5% to 7%. Our gross profit and operating profit guidance ranges also reflect the rollout of our professional pricing initiative, which we strongly believe will further solidify our competitive position and drive long-term profitable growth.”
