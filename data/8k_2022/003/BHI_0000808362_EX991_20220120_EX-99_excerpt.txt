Baker Hughes Company Announces Fourth Quarter and Total Year 2021 Results

LONDON & HOUSTON (January 20, 2022) – Baker Hughes Company (Nasdaq: BKR) ("Baker Hughes" or the "Company") announced results today for the fourth quarter and total year 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

"F" is used in most instances when variance is above 100%. Additionally, "U" is used in most instances when variance is below (100)%.

“We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we generated another quarter of strong free cash flow, solid margin rate improvement, and strong orders from TPS. For the full year, we were pleased with our performance and took several important steps to accelerate our strategy and help position the Company for the future. Overall, 2021 proved to be successful on many fronts for Baker Hughes, with key commercial successes and developments in the LNG and new energy markets, as well as record cash flow from operations and free cash flow, and peer-leading capital allocation. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to achieve our goals, deliver for our customers and move the Company forward.” said Lorenzo Simonelli, Baker Hughes chairman and chief executive officer.

“As we look ahead to 2022, we expect the pace of global economic growth to remain strong although slightly moderate compared to 2021. We believe the broader macro recovery should translate into rising energy demand for 2022 and relatively tight supplies for oil and natural gas, providing an attractive investment environment for our customers and a strong tailwind for many of our product companies."

“We are very excited with the strategic direction of Baker Hughes and believe the Company is well-positioned to capitalize on near-term cyclical recovery and for long-term change in the energy and industrial markets. We look forward to another year of supporting our customers, continuing to advance our strategy, and delivering for shareholders in 2022,” concluded Simonelli.

OFS secured a contract with LUKOIL to begin developing 14 offshore wells in the Baltic Sea’s D33 field. The contract will feature the first-ever combined deployment of Baker Hughes’ electrical submersible pumps (ESP) and LUKOIL’s Permanent Magnet Motors (PMM) since the two companies announced a collaboration on energy efficient technologies in June 2021. Baker Hughes’ ESP technology has unsurpassed levels of efficiency, reliability, and performance, while LUKOIL’s PMM technology enables a 15-20% reduction in energy consumption compared to current artificial lift processes.

OFS also secured a two-year contract for technology and services for a major operator in the Permian Basin. The contract combines best-in-class technology and services from the Artificial Lift, Oilfield & Industrial Chemicals, and Reservoir Technical Services product lines, including the CENesis PHASE Artificial Lift system, which optimizes production, extends asset life, increases personnel safety, lowers lifting costs and reduces environmental footprint.

The TPS segment continued to maintain its LNG leadership. TPS secured a major contract from Bechtel to provide high-efficiency gas turbines and centrifugal compressors to support the expansion of the Pluto LNG onshore processing facility in Australia, which is operated by Woodside. The contract will provide six LM6000PF+ aeroderivative gas turbines, 14 centrifugal compressors and additional equipment for Pluto LNG’s second train, leading to an additional expected capacity of approximately 5 million tons per annum (MTPA) and helping to maximize efficiency and flexibility while lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

TPS secured a contract with NOVATEK PAO to provide advanced turbomachinery equipment for a feed gas boosting station in Russia. TPS will provide five turbo-compressors, driven by Frame 5/2D gas turbines, to support the facility, stabilizing the pressure and flow rate of feed gas to maintain maximum carrying capacity. Baker Hughes and NOVATEK have a long history of collaboration, and TPS’ gas turbines have operated successfully at NOVATEK's projects since 2017.

OFE secured a major 10-year contract from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) for the Surface Pressure Control (SPC) product line to manufacture, supply, store, and service surface wellheads and tree systems. The contract includes ADNOC’s onshore and offshore fields in the UAE as well as a long-term service contract to cover repair, maintenance and spares for the project’s equipment. 

The DS segment continued to gain traction in multiple industrial end markets, particularly in the automotive and electronics sectors. The Waygate Technologies product line continued to lead in market share for industrial computed tomography (CT) systems, achieving record revenue in the fourth quarter for battery inspection and securing contracts with major electric vehicle manufacturers and battery suppliers in Europe and Asia.

Executing on Priorities 

Baker Hughes and Shell signed a broad strategic collaboration agreement to accelerate the global energy transition. Shell will provide select Baker Hughes sites in the U.S. with power and renewable energy credits, as well as negotiate renewable power for Baker Hughes sites in Europe and Singapore. The two companies will also identify opportunities to accelerate each other’s transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, such as Baker Hughes providing low-carbon solutions for Shell’s LNG fleet through technology upgrades and compressor re-bundles. Baker Hughes will also help Shell develop digital solutions to accelerate decarbonization across Shell’s global assets and operations. The two companies will also explore potential opportunities to co-invest and participate in new models to decarbonize the energy and industrial sectors.

Baker Hughes saw continued customer interest in carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) applications. TPS secured a contract with Santos, a leading natural gas producer in Australia, to supply turbomachinery equipment for the Moomba CCS project, which will serve a gas processing plant and permanently store 1.7 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually. The equipment scope includes PGT25+G4 aeroderivative gas turbine, MCL compressor, and PCL compressor technologies to compress CO2 captured at Moomba CCS for transportation and subsequent injection for storage.

TPS continued to support the growth of the hydrogen economy, securing a contract with Air Products to supply advanced compression technology for the NEOM carbon-free hydrogen project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The contract follows the two companies’ hydrogen collaboration agreement announced in mid-2021. 

Baker Hughes announced an approximately 20% investment in Ekona Power Inc, a growth stage company developing novel hydrogen production technology. The two companies have joined efforts to accelerate the scale up and industrialization of the technology by identifying suitable pilot projects and leveraging Baker Hughes’ leading turbomachinery portfolio as well as established technical expertise in providing modular and scalable solutions for global hydrogen and natural gas projects. Baker Hughes has also assumed a seat on Ekona’s Board of Directors.

DS continued to secure important contracts with key energy and industrial customers for condition monitoring and industrial asset management solutions. The Bently Nevada product line secured a contract with a major oil company to deploy System 1 asset management software as a standardized platform for enterprise-wide condition monitoring across 28 facilities worldwide. In addition, Bently Nevada secured a five-year service agreement for a major customer in the mining segment to provide asset strategy consulting services and support the customer’s digital transformation to help increase production and improve equipment reliability.

Bently Nevada also secured a contract with Yara, one of the world’s leading fertilizer companies, to enable digital transformation and improve asset reliability and efficiency. The enterprise-wide contract will enable data availability between Yara’s plant operations and the cloud across 23 sites using Bently Nevada’s latest System 1 asset management software, accompanied by a maintenance, support and services agreement.

Baker Hughes continued to invest in industrial asset management capabilities, announcing an investment and multi-year commercial alliance with Augury, a machine health solution provider, to deliver an expanded integrated asset performance management solution through Bently Nevada. Through the alliance, customers will benefit from end-to-end visibility into the health and performance of critical assets and the entire balance of plant, leading to reduced downtime, increased availability and lower maintenance costs.
