2022 Outlook

•Total capital investment in 2022 expected to be between $1,400 and $1,500 million, with approximately 88 percent allocated towards drilling and completion operations.

•2022 capital investment is less than 35 percent of projected cash flow from operating activities, at recent strip prices. 

•Projecting 2022 free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $3 billion, at recent strip prices. 

•Guiding to combined company 4 and 10 percent annual oil volume growth and approximately 3 percent total equivalent production decline. 

See “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for descriptions of the above non-GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of these measures to the associated GAAP measures.

Thomas E. Jorden, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, "Coterra's initial quarter as a combined company generated solid results and we are excited to communicate our 2022 plans. We look to remain disciplined in 2022, with plans to reinvest less than 35 percent of our projected cash flow from operating activities, at the recent strip. While all three regions provide ample and competitive opportunities for investment, in light of inflation, service availability and prevailing commodity prices, we made a tactical decision to allocate incremental capital toward our oil assets. This decision was driven by our focus on optimizing free cash flow generation and returns to shareholders, with the added benefit of providing a more balanced revenue profile between liquids and natural gas.” 

"Today we also proudly announce the next phase of our shareholder return strategy, both by increasing our base common dividend and initiating a $1.25 billion share repurchase program. We remain committed to returning 50 percent plus of quarterly free cash flow through our base plus variable dividend framework and using share repurchases as a supplemental shareholder return method."

Coterra incurred a total of $725 million of capital expenditures in full-year 2021, including $688 million of drilling and completion capital. Combined capital expenditures incurred in 2021, excluding capitalized expenses incurred by Cimarex prior to the Merger, totaled $1,211 million, including $1,135 million of drilling and completion capital. 

Strong Financial Position

As of December 31, 2021, Coterra had total long-term debt of $3.1 billion with a principal amount of $2.9 billion, with no substantial maturities until 2024. The Company exited the year with a cash balance of $1.0 billion and no debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility. Coterra's net debt to trailing twelve month EBITDAX ratio (non-GAAP) at December 31, 2021 was 0.95x. The Company's net debt to combined trailing twelve month EBITDAX ratio (non-GAAP) was 0.65x at December 31, 2021. 

2021 Proved Reserves

At December 31, 2021, Coterra's proved reserves totaled 2,893 MMBoe, up 27 percent from the Company's proved reserves of 2,279 MMBoe at December 31, 2020, which is primarily driven by the Merger. The Company's proved reserves are approximately 86 percent natural gas, 6 percent oil and 8 percent NGLs. Proved developed reserves totaled 2,128 MMBoe, or 74 percent of the total proved reserves. Coterra's proved reserves at December 31, 2021 represent a 3 percent increase to the combined reserves of legacy Cabot and Cimarex, which totaled 2,813 MMBoe at December 31, 2020. The increase to proved reserves at year-end 2021 compared to the combined proved reserves at year-end 2020 is primarily attributed to the addition of new proved developed producing wells. For a summary of Coterra's estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2021, see the "Year-End Proved Reserves" table below. 

Outlook

Coterra plans to invest $1,400 to $1,500 million in 2022, of which $1,225 to $1,325 million is allocated to drilling and completion activities. The Company expects to turn-in-line 134 to 153 total net wells in 2022 across its three operating regions. Approximately 49 percent of drilling and completion capital will be invested in the Permian Basin, 44 percent in the Marcellus Shale and the balance in the Anadarko Basin. Midstream, saltwater disposal, electrification, infrastructure and other investments are expected to total approximately $175 million in the year.

In 2022, total equivalent production is expected to average between 600 and 635 MBoepd, down 3 percent at the midpoint from combined Coterra and legacy Cimarex 2021 production of 634 MBoepd. Oil production for the year is expected to be 81 to 86 MBopd, up 4 to 10 percent from combined Coterra and legacy Cimarex full-year 2021 volumes. Full-year natural gas production is projected to be 2,680 to 2,850 MMcfpd. First-quarter 2022 total equivalent production is expected to average between 610 to 630 MBoepd, including natural gas volumes between 2,775 and 2,850 MMcfpd and oil production of 79 to 82 MBopd. 

Increasing Returns to Shareholders 

On February 23, 2022, Coterra's Board approved a 20 percent increase to the annual base common dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.60 per share ($0.15 per share, per quarter). 

Based on fourth-quarter 2021 free cash flow (non-GAAP), Coterra's Board today declared a quarterly base plus variable dividend of $0.56 per share. The base plus variable dividend reflects a $0.15 per share base component and a variable component of $0.41 per share, on the Company's common stock. The combined base plus variable dividend represents 48 percent of cash flow from operating activities in fourth-quarter 2021, or 60 percent of free cash flow (non-GAAP) . The combined base and variable dividend is payable on March 17, 2022, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 7, 2022. 

The Company also announced today the next step in its shareholder return strategy, initiating a supplementary share repurchase program with a $1.25 billion authorization, which represents approximately 7 percent of our current market capitalization. 

The timing and volume of share repurchases under this authorization will be determined by management, at its discretion. Management expects its share repurchase program to be driven by relative and intrinsic value opportunities. The share repurchase program is in excess of the Company's base plus variable dividend strategy and our first priority remains funding and growing a sustainable base dividend.

Coterra is committed to environmental stewardship, sustainable practices, and strong corporate governance. Coterra has published combined environmental and safety metrics for 2019 and 2020 related to legacy Cabot and Cimarex operations, which can be accessed on the "Our Performance" page under the "A Sustainable Future" section of the Company's website at www.coterra.com.

•15% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity,

•48% reduction in methane emissions intensity,

•50% reduction in Permian Basin high-pressure flaring intensity, and

•Zero routine high-pressure flaring across all three operating regions by year-end.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)

We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). However, we believe certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods. In addition, we believe these measures are used by analysts and others in the valuation, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. See the reconciliations below that compare GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated.

We have also included herein certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Due to the forward-looking nature of these non-GAAP financial measures, we cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures, such as future impairments and future changes in capital. Accordingly, we are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures. Reconciling items in future periods could be significant.

Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share are presented based on our management's belief that these non-GAAP measures enable a user of financial information to understand the impact of identified adjustments on reported results. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income plus gain and loss on sale of assets, non-cash gain and loss on derivative instruments, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, merger-related expenses and tax effect on selected items. Adjusted Earnings per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding. Additionally, we believe these measures provide beneficial comparisons to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods and use these measures for that purpose. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income and earnings per share, as defined by GAAP.

Reconciliation of Discretionary Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow

Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities excluding changes in assets and liabilities. Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company’s ability to generate available cash to internally fund exploration and development activities, return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and service debt and is used by our management for that purpose. Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on our management’s belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity.

Free Cash Flow is defined as Discretionary Cash Flow less cash paid for capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow is an indicator of a company’s ability to generate cash flow after spending the money required to maintain or expand its asset base, and is used by our management for that purpose. Free Cash Flow is presented based on our management’s belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or net income, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity.

Reconciliation of EBITDAX

EBITDAX is defined as net income plus interest expense, other expense, income tax expense and benefit, depreciation, depletion, and amortization (including impairments), exploration expense, gain and loss on sale of assets, non-cash gain and loss on derivative instruments, stock-based compensation expense and merger-related expense. EBITDAX is presented on our management’s belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when evaluating our ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur debt without regard to financial or capital structure. Our management uses EBITDAX for that purpose. EBITDAX is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

18

Reconciliation of Net Debt

The total debt to total capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders’ equity. This ratio is a measurement which is presented in our annual and interim filings and our management believes this ratio is useful to investors in assessing our leverage. Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents from total debt. The Net Debt to Adjusted Capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing Net Debt by the sum of Net Debt and total stockholders’ equity. Net Debt and the Net Debt to Adjusted Capitalization ratio are non-GAAP measures which our management believes are also useful to investors when assessing our leverage since we have the ability to and may decide to use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents to retire debt. Our management uses these measures for that purpose. Additionally, as our planned expenditures are not expected to result in additional debt, our management believes it is appropriate to apply cash and cash equivalents to reduce debt in calculating the Net Debt to Adjusted Capitalization ratio.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Reconciliation of Net Debt to EBITDAX - Coterra

Net debt to EBITDAX is defined as net debt divided by trailing twelve month EBITDAX. Net debt to EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure which our management believes is useful to investors when assessing our credit position and leverage. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

19

Reconciliation of Net Debt to EBITDAX - Combined

EBITDAX is presented on our management’s belief that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when evaluating our ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur debt without regard to financial or capital structure. Our management uses EBITDAX for that purpose. EBITDAX is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity. 

The EBITDAX used in the calculation below is reflective of nine months of legacy Cabot and Cimarex EBITDAX, plus three months of Coterra EBITDAX. Legacy Cimarex operated under the full cost accounting method, unlike legacy Cabot, now Coterra, which operates under the successful efforts accounting method. This difference in accounting methodologies leads to differences in the calculation of company financials and the figures below should not be relied on to predict future performance of the combined business, which operates under the successful efforts accounting method.
