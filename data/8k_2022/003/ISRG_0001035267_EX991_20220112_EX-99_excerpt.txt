Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

During 2020, da Vinci procedure volumes and system placements were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as healthcare systems around the world diverted resources to respond to COVID-19. During 2021, COVID-19 resurgences continued to impact da Vinci procedure volumes. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business has, and continues to, differ by geography and region. COVID-19 has had, and will likely continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company’s procedure volumes.

Commenting on the announcement, Intuitive CEO Gary Guthart said, “Our customers continued to choose our products in the fourth quarter during a difficult healthcare environment. As we enter 2022, we remain focused on supporting our customers and advancing our innovative ecosystem of platforms, learning, and services aimed at improving minimally invasive care.”
