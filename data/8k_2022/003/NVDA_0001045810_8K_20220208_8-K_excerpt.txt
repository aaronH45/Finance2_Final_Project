On February 8, 2022, NVIDIA Corporation (the “Company”), SoftBank Group Capital Limited (“SoftBank”) and SVF Holdco (UK) Limited (together with SoftBank, the “Sellers”) mutually terminated the Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated as of September 13, 2020, by and among the Company, NVIDIA International Holdings Inc., the Sellers and Arm Limited. The material terms of the Purchase Agreement were previously disclosed on a Form 8-K filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 14, 2020. The parties agreed to terminate the Purchase Agreement because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Sellers will retain the $1.25 billion prepaid by the Company, and the Company will retain its 20-year Arm license. The Company intends to record a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, inclusive of the $1.25 billion prepayment provided at signing, due to the termination of the Purchase Agreement.
