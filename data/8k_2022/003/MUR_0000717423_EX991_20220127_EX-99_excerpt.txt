“I am proud of the accomplishments our organization achieved in 2021. We produced more oil than originally planned, with less capital, while also lowering our total debt by 17 percent.

Also, we have been able to maintain the schedule on our major Gulf of Mexico projects despite the continued headwinds of a pandemic and significant hurricane,” said Roger W. Jenkins, President and Chief Executive Officer. “With a great year of execution in 2021 and significant incremental cash flow coming this year, we can now increase our long-standing dividend while simultaneously continuing our debt reduction strategy.”

FINANCIAL POSITION

EXHIBIT 99.1

On December 2, 2021, Murphy redeemed $150 million of its 6.875 percent senior notes due 2024 for a redemption price of 101.719 percent. Total debt of $2.46 billion as of the end of fourth quarter 2021 consists of long-term, fixed-rate notes with a weighted average maturity of 7.5 years and a weighted average coupon of 6.2 percent.

Overall, Murphy achieved its long-term debt reduction goal of $300 million for the second half of 2021, as well as reduced total debt by $530 million, or 17 percent, since year-end 2020.

“I am pleased with our strong operational execution and disciplined spending in 2021, which allowed us to achieve our goal of repaying $300 million in long-term debt while also building our cash position due to higher realized oil prices than originally budgeted. This multi-faceted success has positioned Murphy for ongoing debt reductions and a dividend increase in 2022,” said Jenkins.

YEAR-END 2021 PROVED RESERVES 

Murphy’s preliminary year-end 2021 proved reserves were 699 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE), consisting of 39 percent oil and 44 percent liquids. Total proved reserves were up from year-end 2020 with a total reserve replacement of 102 percent.

The company maintained a solid reserve life index of 12 years with 58 percent proved developed reserves.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

EXHIBIT 99.1

Eagle Ford Shale – Murphy produced an average 33 MBOEPD with 69 percent oil volumes in the fourth quarter. Four Catarina wells were brought online as planned, with the two Upper Eagle Ford Shale wells and one Austin Chalk well performing in-line with expectations, while the one Lower Eagle Ford Shale well significantly exceeded its type curve. 

Tupper Montney – In the fourth quarter, natural gas production averaged 263 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD). No wells were brought online during the quarter.

Kaybob Duvernay – Production averaged 7 MBOEPD with 70 percent liquids volumes during the fourth quarter. 

Offshore 

Excluding noncontrolling interest, the offshore business produced 64 MBOEPD for the fourth quarter, comprised of 81 percent oil. 

Gulf of Mexico – Production averaged 61 MBOEPD, consisting of 80 percent oil during the quarter. Murphy completed its repairs following Hurricane Ida, with 1.5 MBOEPD remaining offline through the majority of first quarter 2022 as a third-party completes downstream repairs. 

Murphy’s major projects continue to advance on schedule, with the Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai project expected to produce first oil in the second quarter of 2022 through the King’s Quay floating production system. Murphy began completions work on the 7-well program in the fourth quarter, while the King’s Quay floating production system was transported to its final location in the Gulf of Mexico to prepare for first oil.

Canada – Production averaged 3 MBOEPD in the fourth quarter, comprised of 100 percent oil. The non-operated Terra Nova floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel was transported to Spain during the quarter to begin drydock work for the asset life extension project.

EXPLORATION

Gulf of Mexico – Participated in the Gulf of Mexico Federal Lease Sale 257 and was named apparent high bidder on three deepwater blocks.

COMMODITY HEDGES

Murphy employs commodity derivative instruments to manage certain risks associated with commodity price volatility and underpin capital returns associated with certain assets. 

During the fourth quarter, Murphy added hedges to protect cash flow with the execution of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) costless collars. As a result, Murphy has a total 25 thousand barrels of oil per day (MBOPD) hedged for full year 2022 with a weighted average put price of $63.24 per barrel and weighted average call price of $75.20 per barrel.

The company also maintains 20 MBOPD of full-year 2022 production hedged with an average fixed price swap price of $44.88 per barrel. 

Murphy continues its natural gas price risk protection with fixed price forward sales contracts for physical delivery at the AECO hub in Canada for calendar years 2022 through 2024. Details for the current hedge positions can be found in the attached schedules.

2022 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND PRODUCTION GUIDANCE

Murphy is planning 2022 capital expenditures (CAPEX) to be in the range of $840 million to $890 million with full year 2022 production to be in the range of 164 to 172 MBOEPD, comprised of approximately 52 percent oil and 57 percent total liquids volumes. Production for first quarter 2022 is estimated to be in the range of 133 to 139 MBOEPD with 54 percent oil volumes, impacted by significant planned downtime in the Gulf of Mexico primarily for maintenance activities at both operated and non-operated locations. Both production and CAPEX guidance ranges exclude Gulf of Mexico noncontrolling interest (NCI).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Accrual CAPEX, based on midpoint of guidance range and excluding NCI. 

“Our 2022 budget is higher than 2021, with capital designated toward finalizing key development projects in the Gulf of Mexico while maintaining oil volumes across the portfolio. In addition, we forecast an additional $300 million in long-term debt reduction assuming a $65 oil price in 2022, which will be increased with stronger oil prices. This plan also allows Murphy the ability to generate ample free cash flow in order to increase our quarterly dividend by 20 percent to $0.15 per diluted share for the first quarter 2022, as recently approved by our Board of Directors,” said Jenkins. “As we continue our plan to delever, we forecast generating additional 

6

EXHIBIT 99.1

free cash flow, which will give us optionality in returning cash to shareholders and supporting future exploration success.”

The table below illustrates the capital allocation by area.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Murphy plans to spend approximately $330 million, or 38 percent, of 2022 capital to the Gulf of Mexico for development drilling and field development projects. This includes bringing the major Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai project online with first oil scheduled to flow in the second quarter, as well as advancing the non-operated St. Malo waterflood project prior to its completion in 2023. Other plans include drilling an operated development well at Dalmatian with production scheduled to come online in 2023 and executing subsea tiebacks at non-operated Lucius.

Murphy has allocated $220 million, or 25 percent, of 2022 spending to the Eagle Ford Shale, which is $50 million higher than in 2021 due to increased drilling as a result of minimal uncompleted operated wells from 2021 activity. This includes $150 million for drilling 29 and bringing online 27 operated wells in the company’s Karnes and Catarina acreage, as well as drilling 23 and bringing online 32 non-operated wells in Karnes and Tilden acreage. The remaining $70 million of 2022 spending in this area is to support field development.

The company plans to spend 16 percent, or $140 million, of its 2022 capital plan in Canada onshore across the Tupper Montney and Kaybob Duvernay operations. Approximately $120 million of which is allocated to the Tupper Montney to drill 23 and bring online 20 operated wells. The remaining $20 million is primarily allocated to Kaybob Duvernay to bring online 3 operated wells in the Two Creeks area and for field development.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: All well counts are shown gross. Eagle Ford Shale non-operated working interest averages 14 percent.

Approximately 8 percent of spending, or $70 million, has been allocated to Canada offshore for 2022, with $55 million earmarked to support the sanctioned asset life extension project for the non-operated Terra Nova FPSO. The remaining $15 million is allocated to non-operated Hibernia to support development drilling and field development. 

Murphy has allocated $75 million to its 2022 exploration program, with the majority of spending designated for drilling exploration wells in Brazil, offshore Mexico and Brunei. Other capital of approximately $30 million, or 4 percent of budget, primarily consists of capitalized interest costs. 

Detailed guidance for the first quarter and full year 2022 is contained in the following schedule.
