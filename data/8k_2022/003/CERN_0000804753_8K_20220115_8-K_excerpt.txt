Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On January 15, 2022 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Cerner Corporation (the “Company”) approved entering into a letter agreement with each of David Feinberg and Jerome Labat, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, respectively, (each, a “Waiver”) that amends his employment or severance agreement (each, a “Severance Agreement”) effective in connection with the closing of Oracle Corporation and OC Acquisition LLC’s (“Parent”) contemplated acquisition of the Company (the “Transaction”). 

Pursuant to the Waivers, each executive agreed to waive any right to voluntarily terminate employment for “good reason” or “constructive termination” due to a material, adverse change in his authority, duties, position or responsibilities or reporting structure for a period of 12 months following the closing date of the Transaction (the “Waiver Period”). If the executive’s employment with the Company, Parent or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company or Parent (collectively, the “Cerner Group”) during the 12-month period following the closing of the Transaction is terminated without cause or for any other reason that constitutes a constructive termination or good reason, he will become entitled to receive the payments, vesting acceleration and benefits under his Severance Agreement for a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control (the “Severance Benefits”). If the executive remains employed thereafter with the Cerner Group through the completion of the Waiver Period, then he will be paid, issued and provided, as applicable, all the Severance Benefits (regardless of whether he remains employed with the Cerner Group), except that if he continues to stay employed, he will not be entitled to any Severance Benefits relating to continued COBRA benefits. Thereafter, he will have no continuing severance rights or entitlements, and no member of the Cerner Group will have any continuing severance obligations to him under his agreement.
