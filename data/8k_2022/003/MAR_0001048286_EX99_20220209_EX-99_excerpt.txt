(NASDAQ; MAR) that he plans to retire as Executive Chairman in May and will not stand for re-election to the Board at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In recognition of Mr. Marriott’s leadership and his significant contributions to the Company, the Board formally designated him Chairman Emeritus, effective immediately following the upcoming 2022 Annual Meeting. In addition, the Board has elected Mr. David S. Marriott to succeed Mr. J.W. Marriott, Jr. as Chairman of the Board, also effective immediately following the Annual Meeting.  

J.W. Marriott, Jr. guided what was once a family-run root beer stand and restaurant business to a global hospitality company that is today comprised of nearly 8,000 properties across 30 brands in 139 countries and territories. Mr. Marriott’s passion for the hospitality industry began at an early age. He spent his high school and college years working in a variety of positions in the family’s Hot Shoppes restaurant chain. He became a full-time associate in 1956, and soon afterward began overseeing the first Marriott hotel. He became President of the company in 1964 and Chief Executive Officer in 1972, a role he held for 40 years before stepping down on March 31, 2012. He was elected Chairman of the Board in 1985.  

“On behalf of the board and the hundreds of thousands of people who wear a Marriott name badge around the world, I’d like to thank Mr. Marriott for his outstanding leadership throughout his tenure with the company. He is truly an industry icon,” said Anthony Capuano, Chief Executive Officer, Marriott International. “I’d also like to congratulate David Marriott on being elected Chairman of the Board. Not only does he have tremendous operational experience from his career at Marriott, but hospitality is in his DNA. I look forward to working alongside him for years to come.”  

David Marriott joined Marriott International in 1999 and was elected as a director in 2021. Prior to joining the Board, David held a number of operational roles during his tenure with the company, including most recently as the President, U.S. Full Service Managed by Marriott, where he was responsible for oversight of more than 330 hotels operating under 14 brands in 34 states. In this capacity, he oversaw Hotel Operations, Human Resources, Sales & Marketing, Finance, Market Strategy, Information Resources and Development & Feasibility. Previously, David served as Chief Operations Officer - The Americas Eastern Region from 2010 to 2018 and he also oversaw the U.S. integration efforts of Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts.

Ms. Goren joined American as a financial analyst and held management positions in human resources and revenue management, before becoming the Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Goren also served as President of AMR Services, a leading provider of ground services at major airports around the world and a subsidiary of AMR Corporation. Upon the sale of that business, Ms. Goren assumed the leadership of American’s Customer Services Planning functions. Her responsibilities were later expanded to also include management of Asia Pacific Operations. 

“I’m excited to welcome Bella to Marriott’s Board of Directors,” said Anthony Capuano, Chief Executive Officer, Marriott International. “Bella’s corporate and operational experience, coupled with her deep understanding of and commitment to the travel business will be a tremendous resource to the company as we continue to work toward a sustained global recovery of our industry.”
