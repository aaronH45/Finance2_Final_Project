"I want to thank our employees for their hard work and results over the past year.

Reaffirming 2022 and long-term financial guidance

NiSource reaffirms its 2022 non-GAAP diluted net operating EPS guidance of $1.42 to $1.48, consistent with its near and long-term growth commitments.

Non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings per share (NOEPS) are expected to grow by 7 to 9 percent, from 2021's full year results of $1.37 through 2024, on a compound annual growth rate basis, including near-term annual growth of 5 to 7 percent through 2023. NiSource reminds investors that it does not provide a GAAP equivalent of its earnings guidance due to the impact of unpredictable factors such as fluctuations in weather and other unusual and infrequent items included in GAAP results. 

The company continues on track to make capital investments totaling approximately $10 billion during the 2021-2024 period, comprised of annual investments of $1.9 to $2.2 billion for growth, safety and reliability, and an additional $2 billion in renewable generation to replace the retiring coal-fired generation capacity of Schahfer Generating Station. These investments are expected to drive compound annual rate base growth of 10 to 12 percent for each of the company's businesses through 2024.

Advancing system-wide safety enhancements in 2021

Safety Management System is producing significant reductions in risk throughout NiSource. Major advancements in safety during 2021 include:

•Substantially completed installation of automated shut off valves on all low-pressure gas systems to protect against overpressurization

•Expanded deployment of Picarro advanced leak detection technology that provides additional data for risk-informed decision making 

•Successfully completed stage one of a Safety Management System certification by Lloyd's Register; stage two is planned for 2022

•On track to eliminate all coal-fired generation by 2026-2028

•On track to achieve 50% reduction in methane emissions from gas mains and services by 2025

Fourth quarter 2021 and recent business highlights

Electric operations

Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) received approval of its electric TDSIC 

plan from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) on December 28, 2021. The plan includes $1.64 billion in current and planned investments from 2021 through 2026 to enhance the safety and reliability of electric infrastructure, as well as improve customer service. 

Progress continues on the company’s industry-leading path toward lower-cost, reliable and more sustainable forms of generation:

•Indiana Crossroads I, a 302 megawatt (MW) wind project, entered service in December 

•Four more renewable energy projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2022

•The final seven approved renewables projects are scheduled for completion in 2023

Analysis is under way on investment opportunities resulting from the outcome of the 2021 Integrated Resource Plan. The company estimates that investments of up to $750 million will be necessary to replace the retiring coal capacity associated with Michigan City Generating Station, as well as gas peaking units 16A and 16B at the Schahfer Generating Station site. The NIPSCO portion of this investment will be better understood as bids in the Request for Proposals (RFP) are further evaluated. The company believes the most viable replacement option is a portfolio of diverse resources including incremental solar, stand-alone battery storage and natural gas peaking resources. Additionally, NiSource plans to evaluate hydrogen and emerging storage technologies identified as potential pathways toward further decarbonization of the generation portfolio. 

Gas distribution operations 

Progress continues on two rate cases:

•Columbia Gas of Ohio's rate case is on schedule and awaits a recommendation from the staff of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, to be followed by a procedural schedule. The case is focused on continued investments in infrastructure reliability and safety, seeking an increase of $221.4 million, net of the Capital Expenditure Program (CEP) and Infrastructure Replacement Program (IRP) Riders.

•Constructive settlement discussions continue in NIPSCO's gas rate case. The case seeks a revenue increase of approximately $110 million annually. In addition to infrastructure modernization, the proposal would enable NIPSCO to continue to serve customers with a safe, reliable supply of natural gas, while remaining in compliance with state and federal safety requirements. 

Final orders were received in December in three additional rate cases: 

•Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's proposed settlement was approved as filed. The settlement increases revenue by $58.5 million, and new rates went into effect December 29, 2021. Investments in infrastructure upgrades, system reliability and maintenance enhancements were the focus of the case.

•Columbia Gas of Kentucky received an order approving a proposed settlement. An annual revenue increase of $18.3 million will support continued investments in safety and replacing aging infrastructure. 

•A final order in Columbia Gas of Maryland's rate case grants a revenue increase of $2.4 million, continuing to support investment in safe, reliable infrastructure. 

NiSource continues to explore the renewable natural gas market. The company has:

•Instituted a more streamlined process to review and evaluate requests from renewable gas producers to interconnect with its system as well as established gas quality standards for renewable gas. 

•Advanced its plans to allow customers to reduce the carbon intensity of their natural gas usage through a combination of renewable natural gas and carbon offsets. In Columbia Gas of Ohio’s rate case, it requested authority to establish a voluntary program permitting customers to pay a fixed monthly rider charge to offset emissions. Additional state filings are expected to follow throughout the year. 

Additional information for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, is available on the Investors section of www.nisource.com, including segment and financial information and our presentation to be discussed at the company's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call scheduled for February 23, 2022 at 11 a.m. ET.

Regulation G Disclosure Statement

This press release includes financial results and guidance for NiSource with respect to net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Regulation G. The company includes this measure because management believes it permits investors to view the company’s performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the company’s ongoing business performance. With respect to such guidance, it should be noted that there will likely be a difference between this measure and its GAAP equivalent due to various factors, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in weather, the impact of asset sales and impairments, and other items included in GAAP results. The company is not able to estimate the impact of such factors on GAAP earnings and, as such, is not providing earnings guidance on a GAAP basis. In addition, the company is not able to provide a reconciliation of its non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance to its GAAP equivalent without unreasonable efforts.
