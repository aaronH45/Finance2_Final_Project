“2021 was an outstanding year for Chipotle, highlighting the strength and resiliency of our brand. Together, we accomplished many incredible things as our passionate employees remained dedicated to delivering excellent guest experiences, aligned with our purpose and values,” said Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chipotle. “Moving forward, we believe expanding access and convenience through our digital ecosystem, accelerating unit growth, and continuing to develop and support our restaurant employees, will put us in a much stronger competitive position.”  

 Development Update:  

 Based on the success of small-town locations that are delivering unit economics at or better than traditional Chipotle locations, we provide the following update to our long-term development opportunity:  

   ·    Over time, we believe there can be at least 7,000 Chipotle restaurants in North America, up from the prior goal of 6,000 restaurants. 

   ·    Given the healthy and improving cash on cash returns, we are building a real estate pipeline that will allow us to accelerate unit growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% per year, with greater than 80% of new restaurants having a Chipotlane. 

 COVID-19 and Liquidity Update:  

 Given the resurgence in COVID-19 cases during the fourth quarter due to the Omicron variant, the health and well-being of our employees and guests remains our top priority. Beyond the investments made in our people, restaurants, and supply chain, we are closely following the recommendations of the CDC and local health departments. We have implemented and enhanced numerous protocols that give our employees and guests confidence that Chipotle remains steadfast in our commitment to keep them safe as in-restaurant ordering and dining increases.  

 As of December 31, 2021, Chipotle continues to maintain a strong financial position with $1.4 billion in cash, investments and restricted cash, and no debt. We also have access to a $500 million untapped credit facility. Our financial strength gives us the opportunity to make on-going strategic investments in our people, business, and communities, which we believe will benefit us for years to come.   

 Results for the three months ended December 31, 2021:  

 Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.0 billion, an increase of 22.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in total revenue was driven by a 15.2% increase in comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings. Comparable restaurant sales were fairly consistent in each month of the fourth quarter due to a combination of factors including healthy demand for Smoked Brisket, strength in digital sales, and the benefit of menu price increases. Comparable restaurant sales began to moderate in the back half of December as the number of Omicron cases spiked. This trend intensified through January 2022, which also included challenging weather across the country. Assuming the effects of the pandemic continue to subside, we expect first quarter 2022 comparable restaurant sales to be in the mid to high single digits range.  

 Digital sales grew 3.8% year over year to $811.3 million and represented 41.6% of sales. About half of the digital sales were from order ahead transactions as guests appreciate both the convenience and value offered by this channel, as well as the added convenience of more Chipotlanes.  

 We opened 78 new restaurants during the fourth quarter with 67 (or 86%) including a Chipotlane. These formats continue to perform very well and are helping enhance guest access and convenience, as well as increase new restaurant sales, margins, and returns.   

 Food, beverage and packaging costs in the fourth quarter were 31.6% of total revenue, an increase of 60 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was due primarily to elevated inflation on beef and freight, and to a lesser extent, avocado costs that more than offset the leverage from menu price increases.  

 Restaurant level operating margin was 20.2%, an increase from 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The improvement was driven primarily by leverage from comparable restaurant sales and menu price increases, partially offset by wage inflation and higher commodity costs largely due to beef and freight.   

General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $159.8 million on a GAAP basis, or $132.8 million2 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $18.0 million related to the proposed settlement of legal matters, $7.6 million for a COVID-19 related modification made in December 2020 to the 2018 performance shares, and $1.3 million related to transformation expenses, restaurant closure costs and certain other costs. GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 also include $99.9 million of underlying general and administrative expenses, $29.7 million of non-cash stock compensation, $1.8 million related to higher bonus accruals as well as payroll taxes on equity vesting and stock option exercises, and $1.4 million related to the upcoming all-manager conference.   

 The GAAP effective income tax rate was 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to negative 62.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in the tax rate was primarily due to the tax benefit recorded last year for the 2020 federal net operating loss generated and carried back to prior years. This was partially offset by a net reduction in tax expense mostly related to the write-off of uncertain tax position reserves and more equity vesting and exercises in the fourth quarter of 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, the 2021 fourth quarter effective income tax rate was 18.7%2.   

 Net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $133.5 million, or $4.69 per diluted share, a decrease from $191.0 million, or $6.69 per diluted share, which included an income tax benefit of $3.77 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of legal expenses, modification expenses related to our 2018 PSUs, corporate restructuring, and restaurant asset impairment, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter 2021 was $159.1 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $5.58.   

 During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved the investment of up to an additional $200.0 million, exclusive of commissions, to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. Including this repurchase authorization, $240.9 million was available as of December 31, 2021. The repurchase authorization may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. We repurchased $168.9 million of stock at an average price per share of $1,750 during the fourth quarter.  

 Results for the full year ended December 31, 2021:  

 Total revenue for 2021 was $7.5 billion, an increase of 26.1% compared to 2020. The increase in total revenue was driven by a 19.3% increase in comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings.  

 Digital sales grew 24.7% year over year to $3.4 billion and represented 45.6% of sales. About half of the digital sales were from order ahead transactions as guests better understand the value offered by this channel, as well as the added convenience of more Chipotlanes.  

 We opened 215 new restaurants during the year, bringing the total restaurant count at year-end to 2,966. Of the 215 new restaurants opened during the year, 174 (or 81%) included a Chipotlane. We had a total of 355 Chipotlanes as of year-end.  

 Food, beverage and packaging costs were 30.6% of total revenue, a decrease of 170 basis points compared to 2020. The decrease was largely driven by leverage from menu price increases, which was partially offset by higher freight and beef costs.   

 Restaurant level operating margin was 22.6%, an increase from 17.4% in 2020. The improvement was driven primarily by leverage from comparable restaurant sales and menu price increases, partially offset by wage inflation, higher commodity inflation primarily from freight and beef, as well as increased delivery expenses.   

 General and administrative expenses were $606.9 million on a GAAP basis, or $518.0 million2 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $63.1 million for a COVID-19 related modification made in December 2020 to the 2018 performance shares, $20.1 million related to various legal matters, and $5.6 million related to transformation expenses, restaurant closure costs and certain other costs. GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for full year 2021 also include $380.8 million of underlying general and administrative expenses, $109.5 million of non-cash stock compensation, $24.9 million related to higher bonus accruals as well as payroll taxes on equity vesting and stock option exercises, and $2.9 million related to the upcoming all-manager conference.   

 The GAAP effective income tax rate was 19.7% in 2021, compared to negative 21.1% in 2020. The increase in the tax rate was primarily due to the tax benefit booked last year for the 2020 federal net operating loss generated and carried back to prior years, as well as the proportionality of the excess tax benefits from equity vesting and exercises relative to profit before tax in each respective year. This was partially offset by a net reduction in tax expense mostly related to the write-off of uncertain tax position reserves in 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, the 2021 full year effective income tax rate was 20.0%.  

 2 Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses and non-GAAP effective income tax rate are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures and further information are set forth in the table at the end of this press release.  

Net income for 2021 was $653.0 million, or $22.90 per diluted share, compared to net income of $355.8 million, or $12.52 per diluted share for 2020. Excluding the impact of modification expenses related to our 2018 PSUs, legal expenses, corporate restructuring, restaurant asset impairment, and certain other costs, adjusted net income for 2021 was $724.8 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $25.42.  

 More information will be available in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which we expect to file with the SEC by February 11, 2022.

 RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

 The following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented in the text above to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.   

 Adjusted net income is net income excluding expenses related to restaurant asset impairment, corporate restructuring, legal proceedings, stock-based compensation modification expense, and certain other costs. Adjusted general and administrative expense is general and administrative expense excluding transformation expenses, legal proceedings, stock-based compensation modification expense, and certain other costs. The adjusted effective income tax rate is the effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the after tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments. Restaurant Level Operating Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is equal to the revenues generated by our restaurants less their direct operating costs which consist of food, beverage and packaging, labor, occupancy and other operating costs. This performance measure primarily includes the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other operating costs that are essential to conduct our business. Management uses restaurant level operating margin as a measure of restaurant performance. Management believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP measures in order to facilitate meaningful evaluation of our operating performance across periods. These adjustments are intended to provide greater transparency of underlying performance and to allow investors to evaluate our business on the same basis as our management, which uses these non-GAAP measures in evaluating the company’s performance. Our adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted effective income tax rate and restaurant level operating margin measures may not be comparable to other companies’ adjusted measures. These adjustments are not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial performance would have been during the periods presented and should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further details regarding these adjustments are included in the tables below.
