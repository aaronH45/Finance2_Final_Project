        "This presentation includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Statements using words such as “anticipate,” 'believe,” “intend,” “project,” “plan,” “expect,” “continue,” “estimate,” “goaI,” “forecast,” “may,” or similar expressions help identify forward-looking statements. Chesapeake cannot give any assurance that expectations and projections about future events will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties arid assumptions. These risks and uncertainties include the risks that the proposed transaction may not be consummated, or the benefits contemplated therefrom may not be realized. Additional risks include: the ability to obtain requisite regulatory and stockholder approval and the satisfaction of the other conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction, the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the proposed transaction on relationships, including with employees, suppliers, customers, competitors and credit rating agencies, the ability to achieve revenue growth, and volatility in the price of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. These and other risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in filings made by Chesapeake with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are available to the public free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Chesapeake undertakes no obligation to update publicly or to revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."
