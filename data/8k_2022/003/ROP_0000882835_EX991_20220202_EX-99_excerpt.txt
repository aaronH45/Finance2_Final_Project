Roper Technologies Announces 2021 Financial Results and Initiates 2022 Guidance

Sarasota, Florida, February 2, 2022 ... Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ROP) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2021. Unless otherwise noted, the results and guidance in this press release are presented on a continuing operations basis.

Fourth Quarter 2021

Fourth quarter GAAP and adjusted revenue increased 13% to $1.51 billion, with organic revenue also increasing 13%. GAAP diluted earnings per share (“DEPS”) was $1.87 and adjusted DEPS from continuing operations was $3.73.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $576 million and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 10 basis points to 38.1%. Operating cash flow and free cash flow each increased 4% to $547 million and $529 million, respectively.

Full Year 2021

Full year GAAP and adjusted revenue increased 19% to $5.78 billion, while organic revenue increased 9%.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 22% to $2.21 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points to 38.2%. Operating cash flow was $1.87 billion and adjusted free cash flow increased 19% to $1.80 billion.

“This was another excellent year for Roper,” said Neil Hunn, Roper Technologies’ President and CEO. “Our businesses delivered 9% organic growth enabled by our ongoing commitment to innovation, continued migration to our recurring revenue SaaS solutions, and an improving macro recovery. During the year, we exceeded our debt paydown plan, fueled by our 19% growth in free cash flow. The proceeds from our announced divestiture of TransCore, which we expect to receive during the first quarter, will further expand our capacity for capital deployment.”

2022 Outlook and Guidance

“Roper is entering 2022 with considerable tailwinds,” said Mr. Hunn. “Specifically, we head into this year with software recurring revenue momentum, strong demand, record levels of backlog, and favorable market conditions. Combined with our balance sheet strength and large pipeline of high-quality acquisition opportunities, Roper is well positioned for continued double-digit cash flow compounding.” 

Roper expects full year 2022 adjusted DEPS of $15.25 - $15.55 with first quarter adjusted DEPS of $3.63 - $3.67.

The Company’s guidance excludes the impact of unannounced future acquisitions or divestitures, as well as any redeployment of proceeds from announced divestitures.

During 2021, Roper signed definitive agreements to divest its TransCore, Zetec, and CIVCO Radiotherapy businesses. Roper has completed the divestitures of Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy and expects the TransCore transaction to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The financial results for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
