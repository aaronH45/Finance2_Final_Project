Excluding $0.10 per common share after tax of Notable Items, adjusted earnings per common share were $0.36. Specifically, fourth-quarter results were negatively impacted by $177 million pretax of TCF acquisition-related expenses and $10 million pretax of expenses related to the exit of a strategic distribution relationship.

Return on average assets was 0.92%, return on average common equity was 8.7%, return on average tangible common equity was 13.2%, and adjusted return on average tangible common equity was 18.2%. 

CEO Commentary:

"We are very pleased with our performance for the full year, which included record revenue," said Steve Steinour, chairman, president and CEO. "Thanks to the efforts of our colleagues, we successfully executed on the largest acquisition in our history, while delivering continued organic growth aligned with our strategic objectives."

"We delivered in the fourth quarter, finishing the year with record quarterly loan production, reflecting broad-based contributions across all commercial lending categories." said Steinour. "We enter 2022 increasingly confident in our outlook for growth in revenue and earnings. Commercial lending should fuel balance sheet growth in the coming year, while areas of strategic focus such as capital markets, cards and payments, and wealth management should bolster fee income. We remain committed to delivering sustainable revenue growth, annual positive operating leverage, and top-quartile returns."

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]See Pages 7-9 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) net interest income for the 2021 fourth quarter increased $308 million, or 37%, from the 2020 fourth quarter. This increase reflected the benefit of a $46.8 billion, or 42%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 10 basis point decrease in the FTE net interest margin (NIM) to 2.84%.  Net interest income in the 2021 fourth quarter included $25 million of income from purchase accounting accretion and $20 million of accelerated PPP loan fees recognized upon receipt of forgiveness payments. The year-over-year decreases in average earning asset yields and average liability costs reflected the impact of lower interest rates and changes in balance sheet mix, including elevated deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Compared to the 2021 third quarter, FTE net interest income decreased $29 million, or 2%, reflecting 6 basis points of NIM compression. The net interest income decrease primarily reflected sequential decreases in income from PPP forgiveness and purchase accounting accretion.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Page 7 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Average earning assets for the 2021 fourth quarter increased $46.8 billion, or 42%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting a $28.7 billion, or 35%, increase in average total loans and leases, a $16.0 billion, or

66%, increase in average securities, and a $1.7 billion, or 31%, increase in interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. Average loan balance increases across categories reflect the impact of the TCF acquisition, except for other consumer. Average automobile loans increased $498 million, or 4%, reflecting organic growth and the impact of the TCF acquisition. Other consumer loans increased $629 million, or 61%, primarily as a result of our new Early Pay product. Average commercial & industrial (C&I) loans increased $8.1 billion, or 25%, partially offset by a $4.1 billion decrease in average PPP loans primarily related to forgiveness. 

Compared to the 2021 third quarter, average earning assets decreased $355 million primarily reflecting a $4.3 billion, or 37% decrease in interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank, partially offset by a $4.1 billion, or 11%, increase in average securities primarily reflecting the redeployment of excess liquidity into securities.

Huntington received forgiveness payments for $970 million of PPP loans during the 2021 fourth quarter compared to forgiveness payments for $1.7 billion of PPP loans during the 2021 third quarter.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See Page 7 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Average total interest-bearing liabilities for the 2021 fourth quarter increased $29.5 billion, or 38%, from the year-ago quarter. Average total deposits increased $45.7 billion, or 47%, while average total core deposits increased $45.7 billion, or 49%. Increases across categories reflect the impact of the TCF acquisition, in addition to elevated balances in core deposits largely related to residual government stimulus balances and improved retention. Average total debt decreased $1.0 billion, or 11%, primarily reflecting the maturity and repayment of $3.9 billion of long-term debt over the past five quarters due to strong core deposit growth, partly offset by the acquisition of $1.5 billion of long-term debt from TCF in the 2021 second quarter and a subordinated debt issuance of $500 million in the 2021 third quarter. 

Compared to the 2021 third quarter, average total interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.3 billion, or 1%. Within total core deposits, average total demand deposits increased $1.5 billion, or 2%. Average interest-bearing demand deposits increased $2.8 billion, or 8%, primarily reflecting an increase in both commercial and consumer balances and product conversion related to the TCF acquisition. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits

Card and payment processing income increased $28 million, or 43%, reflecting higher interchange income that was primarily the result of the acquisition. Other noninterest income increased $24 million, or 69%, primarily reflecting $7 million of purchase accounting accretion from acquired unfunded loan commitments and increased amortization of upfront card-related contract renewal fees. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $23 million, or 29%, primarily due to the addition of TCF customers. Trust and investment management services increased $14 million, or 29%, reflecting positive equity market performance over the past 12 months, continued strong net asset flows, and the TCF acquisition. Capital markets fees increased $13 million, or 38%, primarily reflecting higher interest rate derivative fees. Bank owned life insurance income increased $8 million, or 57%, primarily reflecting higher benefit claims. Partially offsetting these increases, mortgage banking income decreased $29 million, or 32%, primarily reflecting lower secondary marketing spreads. Income from the gain on sale of loans decreased $12 million, or 92%, due to higher sales volume in the prior year quarter.

Compared to the 2021 third quarter, total noninterest income decreased $20 million, or 4%.

In addition to the above, marketing expense increased $20 million, or 133%, reflecting an increase in acquisition and deepening spend in new markets.

Reported total noninterest expense decreased $68 million, or 5%, from the 2021 third quarter, reflecting a $47 million reduction in Notable Items to $187 million. Outside data processing and other services decreased $35 million, or 12%, reflecting an $18 million decrease in Notable Items from the prior quarter and elevated costs in the prior quarter related to TCF branch and major systems conversion. Net occupancy decreased $27 million, or 28%, reflecting a $20 million decrease in Notable Items from the prior quarter. Personnel costs decreased $11 million, or 2%, reflecting a $4 million decrease in Notable Items from the prior quarter and decreases in contract help expense. Equipment expense decreased $11 million, or 14%, primarily reflecting a decrease in software related costs and ATM maintenance contracts, partially offset by an increase of $3 million of Notable items. Partially offsetting these decreases, marketing increased $10 million, or 40%, primarily reflecting an increase in brand marketing in new markets.

Credit Quality

(1)Other nonperforming assets include certain impaired securities and/or nonaccrual loans held-for-sale. 

(2)Total NALs as a % of total loans and leases.

(3)Total NPAs as a % of sum of loans and leases, other real estate owned, and other NPAs.

See Pages 12-15 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Overall asset quality metrics were impacted by the TCF acquisition on a year-over-year basis, but showed improvement quarter-over-quarter. Nonperforming assets (NPAs) increased to $750 million, or 0.67% of total loans and leases and OREO, from $563 million, or 0.69%, a year ago. Nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) increased $184 million, or 35%, to $716 million, or 0.64% of total loans and leases. On a linked quarter basis, NALs decreased $145 million, or 17%, and NPAs decreased $143 million, or 16%.  The linked quarter decrease in NALs was within both the commercial and consumer portfolios. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $167 million year-over-year to a benefit of $64 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) decreased $78 million year-over-year and $21 million quarter-over-quarter to $34 million.  NCOs represented an annualized 0.12% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, down from 0.20% in the prior quarter and down from 0.55% in the year-ago quarter. Consumer NCOs in 2021 showed improvement year-over-year, and residential mortgage and home equity recorded net recoveries in the quarter. Commercial NCOs showed improvement year-over-year and on a linked quarter basis. We remain confident in the long-term credit performance of our loan portfolios.

The allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) increased $216 million from the year-ago quarter to $2.0 billion, or 1.81%, of total loans and leases, while the ALLL as a percentage of period-end total NALs decreased to 284% from 341% over the same period, both due to the impact of the TCF acquisition.  The allowance for credit losses (ACL) increased by $241 million from the year-ago quarter to $2.1 billion, or 1.88%, of total loans and 

10

leases. On a linked quarter basis, the ACL decreased $98 million, driven by improving credit quality and an improving economic outlook. We believe levels of the ALLL and ACL are appropriate given the current level of problem loans and the economic outlook.

Capital

Table 11 – Capital Ratios – Ratios Remain within Targeted Operating Ranges

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)December 31, 2021 figures are estimated. Amounts are presented on a Basel III standardized approach basis for calculating risk-weighted assets. The capital ratios reflect Huntington’s election of a five-year transition to delay for two years the full impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period.

See Page 16 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.88% at December 31, 2021, down 7 basis points from last quarter due primarily to share repurchases. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio was 9.33%, down from 10.00% a year ago. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.99% compared to 12.47% at December 31, 2020. The decrease in regulatory capital ratios was driven by the repurchase of $650 million of common shares during 2021, cash dividends, offset by earnings and adjusted for the CECL transition. The balance sheet growth as a result of the TCF acquisition was largely offset by the net of goodwill and intangibles as both are deducted from capital in the ratio calculation. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios also reflect the issuance of $500 million of Series H preferred stock in the 2021 first quarter, the issuance of $175 million of Series I preferred stock in the 2021 second quarter, partially offset by the redemption of $600 million of Series D preferred stock on July 15, 2021 and $100 million of Series C preferred stock on October 15, 2021. Additionally, total risk-based capital ratio reflects the issuance of $558 million of subordinated notes in the 2021 third quarter. 

During the 2021 fourth quarter, Huntington repurchased a total of $150 million of common stock at an average cost of $15.42 per share, as part of a repurchase authorization of $800 million of common shares within the four quarter period from the third quarter of 2021 through the second quarter of 2022. Purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase programs. 

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $88 million in the 2021 fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the 2020 fourth quarter. The effective tax rates for the 2021 fourth quarter and 2020 fourth quarter were 18.0% and 15.8%, respectively. The variance between the 2021 fourth quarter and the 2020 fourth quarter provision for income taxes relates primarily to higher pretax income.

At December 31, 2021, we had a net federal deferred tax liability of $3 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $4 million.

Basis of Presentation

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington’s results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this document, conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Huntington’s website, http://www.huntington.com.

Annualized Data

Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an “annualized” basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.

Fully-Taxable Equivalent Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates.  This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.

Rounding

Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.

Notable Items

From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by management to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by management at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We refer to such items as “Notable Items.” Management believes it is useful to consider certain financial metrics with and without Notable Items, in order to enable a better understanding of company results, increase comparability of period-to-period results, and to evaluate and forecast those results.
