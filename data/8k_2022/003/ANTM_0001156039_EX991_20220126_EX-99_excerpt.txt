Membership: Medical enrollment totaled approximately 45.4 million members as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 2.4 million, or 5.7 percent from the prior year quarter. Government Business enrollment increased by 2.2 million lives compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by organic growth in the Medicaid business, aided by the suspension of eligibility recertification efforts in our markets, the acquisition of MMM, the launch of HealthyBlue in North Carolina, and organic growth in our Medicare Advantage business. Commercial & Specialty Business enrollment increased by 249 thousand year over year primarily driven by strong risk-based membership growth, partially offset by in-group attrition in the group fee-based business.  

During the fourth quarter of 2021, medical enrollment increased sequentially by 303 thousand driven by organic growth in the Medicaid business, and growth in Commercial risk-based and fee-based membership.  

Operating Revenue: Operating revenue was $36.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $4.5 billion, or 14.2 percent, from the prior year quarter and 15.9 percent after adjusting for the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Operating revenue for 2021 was $136.9 billion, representing 13.4 percent growth over 2020, and 15.0 percent growth after adjusting for the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. The increase for both the quarter and the full year was driven by higher premium revenue due to growth in Medicaid, Medicare and Commercial risk-based membership, and growth in pharmacy product revenue within IngenioRx, partially offset by the repeal of the health insurance tax.  

Benefit Expense Ratio: The benefit expense ratio was 89.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 60 basis points versus the prior year quarter and a decrease of 90 basis points after adjusting for the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Excluding the impact of the repeal of the health insurance tax, the decrease was primarily driven by the timing of Medicaid rate actions and reduced costs associated with COVID-related care. The benefit expense ratio was 87.5 percent for the full year of 2021, an increase of 290 basis points year-over-year and an increase of 140 basis points after adjusting for the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Excluding the impact of the repeal of the health insurance tax, the increase was primarily driven by a smaller reduction in non-COVID healthcare utilization as compared to the prior year and an increase in costs associated with COVID-related care.  

Medical claims reserves established at December 31, 2020 developed better than the Company’s expectations as of December 31, 2021, with the majority offset by rebates, risk-corridors and other related mechanisms.  

2   

Days in Claims Payable: Days in Claims Payable was 45.2 days as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of 1.6 days from September 30, 2021 and an increase of 1.8 days as compared to December 31, 2020.  

SG&A Expense Ratio: The SG&A expense ratio was 11.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of 200 basis points from 13.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by growth in operating revenue and the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021, partially offset by increased spend to support growth and business optimization charges taken in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year of 2021, the SG&A expense ratio was 11.6 percent, a decrease of 280 basis points from 14.4 percent in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by growth in operating revenue, the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021, and the absence of charges in 2021 for the BCBSA litigation accrual recognized in 2020 and reduced business optimization charges in 2021, partially offset by increased spend to support growth.  

Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow was $1.7 billion, or 1.5 times net income in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year quarter. The year-on-year decrease was primarily driven by an increase in medical claims payable in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a slight decrease in the fourth quarter of 2021, and an increase in receivables. For the full year 2021, operating cash flow was $8.4 billion, or 1.4 times net income.  

Share Repurchase Program: During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for $522 million, at a weighted average price of $417.92. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $4.2 billion of Board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining.  

Cash Dividend: During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $274 million.  

On January 25, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2022 dividend to shareholders of $1.28 per share, an increase of over 13 percent from the quarterly dividend payment in the fourth quarter. On an annualized basis, the new quarterly dividend equates to $5.12 per share. The first quarter dividend is payable on March 25, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2022.  

Investment Portfolio & Capital Position: During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recorded net gains of $211 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded net gains of $5 million. These amounts are excluded from adjusted earnings per share.

Basis of Presentation  

 1.  

Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to page 15 for the GAAP reconciliation tables.  

 2.  

Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.
