HOUSTON — February 24, 2022 — Occidental (NYSE: OXY) today announced net income attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $1.3 billion, or $1.37 per diluted share, and adjusted income attributable to common stockholders of $1.4 billion, or $1.48 per diluted share. Fourth quarter after-tax items affecting comparability of $111 million included net derivative losses of $107 million and $130 million of charges for non-core expiring domestic onshore undeveloped oil and gas leases and inventory impairments, partially offset by a positive state tax rate revaluation of $88 million and gains on sale of $68 million. 

“Occidental's focus on operational efficiencies in the fourth quarter enabled us to leverage the increases in commodity prices to further improve our balance sheet and liquidity position, and set us on a path toward continued debt reduction and the implementation of a new shareholder return framework in 2022,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub. “Our employees delivered strong operational results, setting new records and efficiency benchmarks in the Permian, Rockies, Gulf of Mexico and Oman in 2021. Additionally, OxyChem recorded its highest annual earnings in 30 years.”

QUARTERLY RESULTS

Oil and Gas

Oil and gas pre-tax income on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $2.1 billion, compared to pre-tax income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2021. The fourth quarter results included $109 million of charges for non-core expiring domestic onshore undeveloped oil and gas leases and inventory impairments, partially offset by gains on sale of $68 million. Excluding items affecting comparability, fourth quarter oil and gas income improved over the third quarter due to higher worldwide crude oil and domestic natural gas prices and higher crude oil volumes, partially offset by 

higher exploration and overhead expenses. For the fourth quarter of 2021, average WTI and Brent marker prices were $77.19 per barrel and $79.76 per barrel, respectively. Average worldwide realized crude oil prices increased by approximately 10 percent from the prior quarter to $75.39 per barrel. Average worldwide realized natural gas liquids (NGL) prices increased by approximately 7 percent from the prior quarter to $36.52 per barrel. Average domestic realized gas prices increased by approximately 39 percent from the prior quarter to $4.64 per Mcf.

Total average global production from continuing operations of 1,189 thousand of barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed) for the fourth quarter exceeded the midpoint of guidance by 49 Mboed. Permian Resources, Rockies and Gulf of Mexico all exceeded the high end of guidance with production of 490 Mboed, 313 Mboed and 149 Mboed, respectively. International average daily production volumes came within guidance at 237 Mboed.

Oil and Gas Proved Reserves

As of December 31, 2021, Occidental's worldwide proved reserves totaled 3.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared to 2.9 billion BOE for the same period in the prior year. Proved reserve additions were mainly driven by positive price and other revisions of 829 million BOE and extensions and discoveries of 145 million BOE. Revisions of proved reserves included 421 million BOE of positive price revisions and 208 million BOE of positive revisions related to additions associated with infill development projects, primarily in the Permian and DJ basins, and further positive revisions of 101 million BOE associated with updates based on reservoir performance. The remaining revisions were associated with various other cost related revisions and management changes in development plans.

OxyChem

Chemical pre-tax income of $574 million for the fourth quarter exceeded guidance by $94 million. Compared to prior quarter income of $407 million, the improvement in fourth quarter income resulted primarily from higher realized prices, volumes and margins across most product lines, partially offset by higher energy costs.

Midstream and Marketing

Midstream and marketing pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter was $15 million, compared to income of $20 million for the third quarter of 2021. The fourth quarter results included $76 million of derivative losses and $21 million of valuation adjustments to inventory. WES equity income for the fourth quarter was $131 million. Midstream and marketing's fourth quarter pre-tax loss, excluding WES equity income, exceeded guidance by over $100 million. Excluding items affecting comparability, midstream and marketing pre-tax fourth quarter results reflected higher margins from the marketing business due to timing of crude sales, optimizations in gas transportation capacities and improved gas transportation spreads, partially offset by higher operating expenses and energy costs in domestic gas processing due to increased NGL production. 

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures

This press release refers to adjusted income (loss), cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and free cash flow, which are supplemental measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Definitions of adjusted income (loss) and a reconciliation to net income (loss), along with cash flow 

from continuing operations before working capital and free cash flow and a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measures, are included in the financial schedules of this press release. Occidental’s definition of adjusted income (loss), cash flow from continuing operations before working capital and free cash flow may differ from similarly titled measures provided by other companies in our industry and as a result may not be comparable.

This press release also refers to finding and development cost (F&D Cost) and reserves replacement ratio, which are non-GAAP measures that Occidental believes are widely used in our industry, as well as by analysts and investors, to measure and evaluate the cost of replacing annual production and adding proved reserves. Occidental's definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures provided by other companies and as a result may not be comparable. F&D Cost - All-In is calculated by dividing total costs incurred for the year as defined by GAAP by the sum of proved reserve revisions, improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and purchases of minerals in place for the year. F&D Cost - Organic is F&D Cost - All-In excluding both the property acquisition costs and purchase of minerals in place, and F&D Cost - Program Additions further excludes other revisions that are not infills. Reserves Replacement - All-In is calculated by dividing the sum of proved reserve revisions, improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and purchases and sales of minerals in place for the year by current year production. Reserves Replacement - Organic is Reserves Replacement - All-In, excluding purchases and sales of minerals in place for the year.

Segment Results Before Tax Allocations

(amounts in millions, except per share and effective tax rate amounts)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Non-GAAP Measure Adjusted income is a non-GAAP measure. Occidental defines adjusted income as net income excluding the effects of significant transactions and events that affect earnings but vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. These events may recur, even across successive reporting periods. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management’s performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental’s earnings performance between periods. Reported net income is considered representative of management’s performance over the long term, and adjusted income is not considered to be an alternative to net income reported in accordance with GAAP.

Segment Results After Tax Allocations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) The adjusted diluted EPS (Non-GAAP) calculations include the dilutive effect of potential common stocks since Occidental generated adjusted income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, dilutive securities for adjusted diluted EPS were 22.6 million and 18.6 million, respectively, resulting in total dilutive weighted-average shares of 956.8 million and 952.4 million shares, respectively. The reported EPS (GAAP) calculations do not include dilutive effect of potential common stocks as their effect is anti-dilutive since Occidental generated net losses from continuing operations.
