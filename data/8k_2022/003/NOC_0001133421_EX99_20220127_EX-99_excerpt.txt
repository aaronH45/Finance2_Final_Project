Fourth quarter 2021 organic sales1 decreased 10 percent from the prior year period due to four less working days in the fourth quarter of 2021 and a $444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer at Aeronautics Systems during the fourth quarter of 2020. 2021 sales were $35.7 billion and 2021 organic sales1 increased 3 percent to $35.5 billion. 

Fourth quarter 2021 net earnings increased to $2.7 billion including a $1.8 billion after-tax mark-to-market pension and OPB (“MTM”) benefit. Fourth quarter 2021 transaction-adjusted net earnings were $948 million, or $6.00 per diluted share, and include an after-tax charge of $73 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, on the F-35 program at Aeronautics Systems largely driven by COVID-19-related impacts. 2021 net earnings increased to $7.0 billion and include the noted MTM benefit as well as the first quarter 2021 after-tax benefit of $1.1 billion for the IT services sale. 2021 transaction adjusted net earnings were $4.1 billion, or $25.63 per diluted share.

Transaction-adjusted Net Earnings and Transaction-adjusted EPS

2021 net earnings benefited from a gain on the sale of the company's IT services business, and fourth quarter and 2021 net earnings reflect a MTM benefit of $1.8 billion, net of tax. Excluding the gain on sale of the business, associated federal and state income tax expenses, transaction costs and the make-whole premium for early debt redemption, as well as the impact of MTM benefit (expense) and related tax impacts, 2021 transaction-adjusted net earnings1 increased 4 percent and transaction-adjusted EPS1 increased 8 percent. Transaction-adjusted net earnings1 and transaction-adjusted EPS1 are measures the company uses to compare performance to prior periods and for EPS guidance. The table below reconciles net earnings and diluted EPS to transaction-adjusted net earnings1 and transaction-adjusted EPS1:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The deferred state tax impact was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 5.25 percent and is included in Unallocated corporate expense within operating income. 

3 The federal tax impact in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax impact from MTM benefit (expense) and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate. 

4 The state tax impact includes $62 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.

5 The federal tax impact was calculated by applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate to the adjustment items and also includes $250 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]Sales

Fourth quarter 2021 sales decreased $1.6 billion, or 15 percent, due, in part to a $583 million reduction in sales related to the IT services divestiture. Fourth quarter 2021 organic sales1 decreased $990 million, or 10 percent, due to lower sales at Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems and Mission Systems, partially offset by higher sales at Space Systems. Fourth quarter 2021 sales were reduced by approximately 6 percent at each of the sectors due to four less working days when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Sector operations also were affected by the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the broader economic environment, including a tight labor market, elevated levels of employee leave, and supply chain challenges. Fourth quarter 2020 sales included a $444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer at Aeronautics Systems.

2021 sales decreased $1.1 billion, or 3 percent, due to a $2.2 billion reduction in sales related to the IT services divestiture. 2021 organic sales1 increased $1.0 billion, or 3 percent due to higher sales at Space and Mission Systems, partially offset by lower sales at Aeronautics Systems and Defense Systems. 2020 sales included a $444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer at Aeronautics Systems.

Operating Income and Margin Rate 

Fourth quarter 2021 operating income decreased $410 million, or 36 percent, primarily due to lower segment operating income, higher unallocated corporate expense, which includes $124 million of MTM-related deferred state tax expense as compared to a $54 million benefit in the prior year period, and a lower FAS/CAS operating adjustment. Fourth quarter 2021 operating margin rate declined to 8.6 percent from 11.3 percent reflecting the items above.

2021 operating income increased $1.6 billion, or 39 percent, primarily due to the IT services divestiture, including the $2.0 billion pre-tax gain on sale and $192 million of unallocated corporate expense for unallowable state taxes and transaction costs, partially offset by a $288 million reduction in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. Lower non-divestiture-related unallocated corporate expenses were partially offset by higher deferred state taxes principally related to the company’s 2021 MTM benefit. 2021 operating margin rate increased to 15.8 percent from 11.0 percent reflecting the items above.

Segment Operating Income1 and Margin Rate1

Fourth quarter 2021 segment operating income decreased $171 million, or 15 percent, primarily due to lower operating income at Aeronautics Systems, principally due to a $93 million unfavorable estimate-at-completion (EAC) adjustment on F-35. Defense Systems operating income also declined in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to the impact of the IT services divestiture. Fourth quarter 2020 segment operating income from the IT services business was $67 million. Fourth quarter 2021 segment operating margin rate of 11.2 percent was consistent with the prior year period.

2021 segment operating income increased $29 million, or 1 percent. Higher operating income at Space Systems and Mission Systems was driven by increased volume and improved performance. Lower operating income at Defense Systems is due to the impact of the IT services divestiture and lower operating income at Aeronautics Systems principally relates to net unfavorable EAC adjustments on F-35. 2021 segment operating income from the IT services business was $20 million as compared to $247 million in 2020. Segment operating income includes a first quarter 2021 benefit of approximately $100 million due to the impact of lower overhead rates on the company’s fixed price contracts. Segment operating margin rate increased to 11.8 percent from 11.4 percent and reflects higher operating margin rates at Mission Systems, Defense Systems and Space Systems. 

Federal and Foreign Income Taxes

The fourth quarter 2021 effective tax rate (ETR) increased to 19.0 percent from (8.2) percent in the prior year period. MTM benefit increased the fourth quarter 2021 ETR by 4.0 percentage points and MTM expense reduced the fourth quarter 2020 ETR by 22.3 percentage points.

The 2021 ETR increased to 21.6 percent from 14.5 percent in the prior year period primarily due to federal income taxes resulting from the IT services divestiture, including $250 million of income tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business. The company’s 2021 MTM benefit did not significantly impact the 2021 ETR; however, MTM expense in 2020 reduced the 2020 ETR by 1.3 percentage points.

Cash Flows

Fourth quarter 2021 cash provided by operating activities decreased $160 million due to $197 million of federal and state taxes paid in connection with the IT services divestiture. 2021 cash provided by operating activities decreased $738 million principally due to federal and state taxes of $785 million paid in connection with the IT services divestiture. Lower 2021 pension and OPB contributions were largely offset by the impact of CARES Act social security tax deferrals and the 2020 increase in Department of Defense (DoD) progress payment rates. 

Fourth quarter 2021 transaction-adjusted free cash flow1 decreased $902 million due to changes in trade working capital and a $263 million reduction associated with CARES Act social security tax deferrals. 2021 transaction-adjusted free cash flow1 decreased $623 million largely due to a $495 million reduction associated with CARES Act social security tax deferrals. 2020 also benefited from the increase in DoD progress payment rates.

Segment Operating Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales

Fourth quarter 2021 sales decreased $856 million, or 25 percent, due to lower volume in both Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems. Approximately 6 percent of the decline relates to four fewer working days than the prior year period. Lower sales also reflect a $444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $109 million of lower F-35 sales. 

2021 sales decreased $910 million, or 7 percent, due to lower volume in both Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems. Lower sales reflect a $444 million sale of equipment to a restricted customer in 2020, $150 million of lower F-35 sales, lower A350 production activity, and lower volume on the B-2 Defensive Management Systems Modernization (DMS) program and certain Global Hawk programs.

Operating Income

Fourth quarter 2021 operating income decreased $119 million, or 35 percent, principally due to lower sales. Operating margin rate decreased to 8.4 percent from 9.7 percent due to a $93 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on F-35 related to continued labor-related production impacts largely driven by COVID-19. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we modified our F-35 production plan to support a more consistent flow on the program and expect gradually to increase production rate over time as COVID-19-related impacts subside. This decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of lower overhead rates on certain fixed-price production programs. 

2021 operating income decreased $113 million, or 9 percent, principally due to lower sales. 2021 operating margin rate decreased to 9.7 percent from 9.9 percent due to lower net favorable EAC adjustments, driven by F-35, partially offset by improved performance on Autonomous Systems programs.

Fourth quarter 2021 organic sales1 decreased $132 million, or 9 percent, principally due to four fewer working days than the prior year period and close-out of the contract at the Army's Lake City ammunition plant (Lake City).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales 

Fourth quarter 2021 sales increased $108 million, or 4 percent, primarily due to higher sales in both the Launch & Strategic Missiles and Space business areas, which more than offset four fewer working days than the prior year period and a $47 million reduction in sales related to the IT services divestiture. Fourth quarter 2021 organic sales1 increased $155 million, or 6 percent. Launch & Strategic Missiles sales increased primarily due to ramp-up on development programs, including a $200 million increase on GBSD and a $98 million increase on the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program, partially offset by a decrease in sales on Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) launch vehicles due to follow-on award timing.

Guidance

 Financial guidance, as well as outlook, trends, expectations and other forward looking statements provided by the company for 2022 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on the information available to the company at the time of this release. The company’s 2022 financial guidance and outlook beyond 2022 reflect what the company currently anticipates will be the impacts on the company from the global COVID-19 pandemic (including related effects on the broader economic environment), based on what the company understands today and what the company has experienced to date. However, the company cannot predict how the pandemic will evolve or what impact it will continue to have, including the potential impact of another variant of COVID-19, another surge of cases, or a prolonged recovery period, and there can be no assurance that the company’s underlying assumptions are correct. As discussed more fully in the company’s Form 10-K, and among other factors, disruptions to the company’s operations or those of its customers, supply chain and logistics challenges, effects on the labor market and our workforce, vaccine mandates and other evolving government requirements, additional liabilities, disruptions in the financial markets and inflation, impacts on programs or payments, and changes in our customers’ priorities, resources and requirements, relating to the global COVID-19 pandemic, today and as it may evolve, can be expected to affect the company’s ability to achieve guidance or meet expectations. In addition, the government budget, appropriations and procurement priorities and processes can impact our customers, programs and financial results. These priorities and processes, including the timing of appropriations and the occurrence of an extended continuing resolution and/or prolonged government shutdown, as well as a breach of the debt ceiling, extraordinary measures taken in connection with a breach, changes in support for our programs, or changes in federal corporate tax or securities laws and regulations, can impact the company's ability to achieve guidance or meet expectations.

Northrop Grumman Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2021 Financial Results21

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Disclosure: This earnings release contains non-GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) financial measures, as defined by SEC Regulation G and indicated by a footnote in the text of the release. Definitions for the non-GAAP measures are provided below and reconciliations are provided in the body of the release, except that reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP measures are not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and financial impact of certain items, including, but not limited to, the impact of any mark-to-market pension adjustment. Other companies may define these measures differently or may utilize different non-GAAP measures.

Transaction-adjusted net earnings: Net earnings excluding impacts related to the company’s IT services divestiture, including the gain on sale of the business, associated federal and state income tax expenses, transaction costs, and the make-whole premium for early debt redemption, as well as MTM benefit (expense) and related tax impacts. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of divestiture activity and pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. This measure is also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of the IT services divestiture and MTM accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. Transaction-adjusted net earnings is reconciled in the “Transaction-adjusted Net Earnings and Transaction-adjusted EPS” table within the body of this release. 

Transaction-adjusted EPS: Diluted earnings per share excluding the per share impacts related to the company’s IT services divestiture, including the gain on sale of the business, associated federal and state income tax expenses, transaction costs, and the make-whole premium for early debt redemption, as well as MTM benefit (expense) and related tax impacts. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance per share by presenting the company’s diluted earnings per share results before the non-operational impact of the IT services divestiture and pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. Transaction-adjusted EPS is reconciled in the “Transaction-adjusted Net Earnings and Transaction-adjusted EPS” table within the body of this release. 

Organic sales: Total sales excluding sales attributable to the company's IT services divestiture. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying sales growth as well as in providing an understanding of our ongoing business and future sales trends by presenting the company’s sales before the impact of divestiture activity. Organic sales is reconciled in Schedule 4 of this release.

Segment operating income and segment operating margin rate: Segment operating income, as reconciled in the “Consolidated Operating Results and Cash Flows” table within the body of this release, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) reflect the combined operating income of our four segments less the operating income associated with intersegment sales. Segment operating income includes pension expense allocated to our sectors under FAR and CAS and excludes FAS pension service expense and unallocated corporate items. These measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP. 

Adjusted free cash flow: Net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer (not otherwise included in net cash provided by or used in operating activities) and the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as

such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction. It also includes the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance. This measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted free cash flow is reconciled in the “Consolidated Operating Results and Cash Flows” table within the body of this release.

Transaction-adjusted free cash flow: Net cash provided by or used in operating activities less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer (not otherwise included in net cash provided by or used in operating activities), the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions and cash paid for federal and state taxes and transaction costs associated with the IT services divestiture. Transaction-adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction. It also includes the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions and cash paid for federal and state taxes and transaction costs associated with the IT services divestiture for consistency and comparability of financial performance.
