IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ: IDXX), a global leader in veterinary diagnostics, veterinary practice software and water microbiology testing, today announced fourth quarter and full year results, as well as an update on U.S. companion animal diagnostic trends.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results

The Company reports revenues of $801 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year period on a reported basis and 10.5% on an organic basis. Fourth quarter results reflect 13% reported and organic revenue gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, with high gains across U.S. and International regions. On a two-year average annual growth basis, CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue increased 18% as reported and 17% organically. Continued strong CAG growth momentum was also supported by record instrument placements, resulting in CAG Diagnostics capital instrument revenue growth of 18% reported and 21% organic, and continued expansion of the Company's cloud-based software capability, which drove veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue growth of 30% as reported and 13% organically.

Earnings per diluted share ("EPS") were $1.89 for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 6% as reported and an increase of 12% on a comparable basis. Prior year reported EPS results included a one-time positive impact of $0.25 per share related to the enactment of tax reform in Switzerland.

Revenue for the full year of $3,215 million increased 19% as reported and 16% on an organic basis, driven by 20% reported and 18% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue.

For the full year 2021, EPS of $8.60 increased 28% on a reported basis and 29% on a comparable basis. EPS results benefited from strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, resulting in 330 basis points of operating margin improvement on a reported basis, and 220 basis points on a comparable basis. EPS results also reflect $0.38 of tax benefits from share-based compensation.

The Company expects full year 2022 revenue growth of 9% - 11% on a reported basis and 10% - 12% revenue growth on an organic basis, supported by 10.5% - 12% reported growth, and 12% - 14% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. The Company also expects EPS of $9.27 - $9.59, reflecting a targeted 50 - 100 basis points of comparable operating margin improvement, building on strong 2021 performance.

"IDEXX had a strong finish to an exceptional 2021, as busy veterinary customers responded positively to our highly differentiated diagnostic testing and information management platforms," said Jay Mazelsky, IDEXX's CEO. "We're pleased to see veterinarians look to IDEXX solutions to support their passion to improve patient care and to run their practices more efficiently at a time when they have never been busier. This has resulted in continued high CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth across our major regions and record levels of premium instrument placements, with solid gains across our major in-clinic platforms. As a Purpose-driven company focused on improving the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock, our outstanding results reflect the high levels of execution across the IDEXX organization through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are well-positioned to build on this momentum moving forward and to address the still significant untapped potential for companion animal healthcare globally."

Companion Animal Diagnostics Trends Update

Positive global trends in companion animal healthcare, including growth in demand for clinical services, continue to support strong growth for companion animal diagnostic products and services across regions. U.S. same-store clinical visit growth at veterinary practices was 2% in the fourth quarter, compared to strong prior year growth levels. On a two-year basis, U.S. same-store clinical visits increased 5.5% with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. Average same-store revenue growth at U.S. veterinary practices was 8% in the fourth quarter, supported by 10% gains in clinical diagnostic revenues. We are monitoring the increase in Omicron cases globally, including impacts on factors like veterinary practice staffing levels, which may impact clinic level growth. Additional U.S. companion animal practice weekly key metrics are available in the Q4 2021 Earnings Snapshot accessible on the IDEXX website, www.idexx.com/investors.

Fourth Quarter Performance Highlights 

Companion Animal Group 

The Companion Animal Group generated 14% reported and 13% organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter. CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth of 13% reflects strength across IDEXX's major modalities globally, supported by continued growth in clinical service demand and expanded utilization of diagnostic products and services.IDEXX VetLab® consumables generated 14% reported and 15% organic revenue growth, supported by expansion of our global premium instrument installed base, high customer retention levels, increased testing utilization, and moderate net price gains. Reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services generated 12% reported and organic revenue growth, reflecting mid-to-high-teen growth in the U.S. and high single-digit gains Internationally compared to strong prior year growth levels. Overall reference lab gains continue to reflect high same-store volume growth with gains across testing categories, and moderate net price gains. Rapid assay products generated 10% reported and organic revenue growth, with continued worldwide growth in canine, feline, and specialty testing benefiting from strong overall demand trends, high customer retention levels, and moderate net price gains.

Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue growth increased 30% on a reported basis and 13% organically, supported by double-digit growth in subscription-based service revenues and strong growth in new veterinary software system placements. Reported growth includes benefits from the acquisition of ezyVet®, which closed in June 2021.

Water

Water achieved revenue growth of 12% on a reported basis and 13% on an organic basis, compared to 1% growth on a reported basis and modest organic growth in the prior year period. Revenue growth reflects continued strengthening of demand for compliance and non-compliance testing compared to prior year revenue levels, which were constrained by pandemic conditions.

Livestock, Poultry and Dairy ("LPD") 

LPD revenue declined 20% on a reported basis and 19% on an organic basis, as compared to 16% growth on a reported basis and 13% organically in the prior year period, which benefited from the ramping of African Swine Fever (ASF) testing programs in China in 2020. Revenue decline reflects comparisons to these high prior year levels and additional impacts in China related to changes in local ASF disease management approaches, lower pork prices and changes in government requirements related to livestock infectious disease testing programs. For the full year 2021, LPD revenue decreased 9% organically compared to 11% gains in 2020. These trends are anticipated to pressure LPD revenues in future quarters, particularly in the first half of 2022, and are factored into the overall 2022 revenue outlook.

Gross Profit and Operating Profit

Gross profits increased 12%, and gross margins of 57% increased 20 basis points compared to prior year results on a reported basis and 10 basis points on a constant currency basis. Gross margin results reflect the benefit from high recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth, moderate net price improvement, and higher software service margins, including positive impacts from an expanded software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscription base. These benefits were offset by business mix impacts from high CAG Diagnostics capital instrument revenue growth and lower LPD and human OPTI COVID-19 PCR testing revenues.

Operating margin was 24.9% in the quarter, 80 basis points lower than the prior year period results on a reported basis and 70 basis points on a comparable basis. Operating expenses increased 15% on a reported and comparable basis. Operating expense growth in the fourth quarter reflects the advancement of commercial, innovation and project investments, the continued integration of ezyVet, and continued recovery in cost areas such as travel & entertainment and employee healthcare benefits.

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following defines terms and conventions and provides reconciliations regarding certain measures used in this earnings release and/or the accompanying earnings conference call that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), otherwise referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. To supplement the Company's consolidated results presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company has disclosed non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or adjust certain items. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors' evaluation of the Company's business performance and liquidity and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Company's business and its liquidity and to the performance and liquidity of our peers. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Constant currency - Constant currency references are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are consistent with how management evaluates our performance and comparisons with prior and future periods. We estimated the net impacts of currency on our revenue, gross profit, operating profit, and EPS results by restating results to the average exchange rates or exchange rate assumptions for the comparative period, which includes adjusting for the estimated impacts of foreign currency hedging transactions and certain impacts on our effective tax rates. These estimated currency changes impacted fourth quarter 2021 results as follows: decreased gross profit growth by 0.6%, increased gross margin growth by 10 basis points, decreased operating expense growth by 0.2%, decreased operating profit margin growth by 10 basis points, and decreased EPS growth by 1%. Estimated currency changes impacted full year 2021 results as follows: increased operating profit margin growth by 20 basis points, and increased EPS growth by 2%. Constant currency revenue growth represents the percentage change in revenue during the applicable period, as compared to the prior year period, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. See the supplementary analysis of results below for revenue percentage change from currency for the three months and year ended December 31, 2021 and refer to the 2022 Growth and Financial Performance Outlook section of this press release for estimated foreign currency exchange rate impacts on 2022 projections and estimates.

Growth and organic revenue growth - All references to growth and organic growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior year period unless specifically noted. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, certain business acquisitions, and divestitures. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers. Two-year average organic growth rates are provided to facilitate easier comparisons between periods impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with prior and future periods, calculated as the average of the growth rates over the two referenced periods. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement of or a superior measure to, revenue growth reported in accordance with GAAP. See the supplementary analysis of results below for a reconciliation of reported revenue growth to organic revenue growth for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021. See the constant currency note above for the impacts of estimated currency changes to fourth quarter and full year 2021, as well estimated full year 2022 organic revenue growth for the Company and CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue. The percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents revenues during the current year period, limited to the initial 12 months from the date of the acquisition, that are directly attributable to business acquisitions. Revenue from acquisitions is expected to have an immaterial impact on projected full year 2022 revenue growth and CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. For a reconciliation of fourth quarter 2020 LPD and Water organic revenue growth to revenue growth reported in accordance with GAAP, see the supplementary analysis of results in the Company's earnings release dated February 2, 2021. 

The reconciliation of the two-year average annual organic growth of CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Comparable growth metrics - Comparable gross profit growth, comparable gross margin gain (or growth), comparable operating expense growth, comparable operating profit growth and comparable operating margin gain (or growth) are non-GAAP financial measures and exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and non-recurring or unusual items (if any). Please refer to the constant currency note above for a summary of foreign currency exchange rate impacts. Management believes that reporting comparable gross profit growth, comparable gross margin gain (or growth), comparable operating expense growth, comparable operating profit growth and comparable operating margin gain (or growth) provides useful information to investors because it enables better period-over-period comparisons of the fundamental financial results by excluding items that vary independent of performance and provides greater transparency to investors regarding key metrics used by management. Comparable gross profit growth, comparable gross margin gain (or growth), comparable operating expense growth, comparable operating profit growth and comparable operating margin gain (or growth) should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements of or superior measures to, gross profit growth, gross margin gain, operating expense growth, operating profit growth and operating margin gain reported in accordance with GAAP.

The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Projected 2022 comparable operating margin expansion outlined in the 2022 Growth and Financial Performance Outlook section of this earnings release reflects the projected full year 2022 reported operating margin adjusted for estimated positive year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate change impact of approximately 20 basis points.

These impacts and those described in the constant currency note above reconcile reported gross profit growth, gross margin gain, operating expense growth, operating profit growth and operating margin gain (including projected 2022 operating margin expansion) to comparable gross profit growth, comparable gross margin gain, comparable operating expense growth, comparable operating profit growth and comparable operating margin gain for the Company.

Comparable EPS growth - Comparable EPS growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the percentage change in earnings per share (diluted) ("EPS") for a measurement period, as compared to the prior base period, net of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior base period and excluding the tax benefits of share-based compensation activity under ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, and non-recurring or unusual items (if any). Management believes comparable EPS growth is a more useful way to measure the Company's business performance than EPS growth because it enables better period-over-period comparisons of the fundamental financial results by excluding items that vary independent of performance and provides greater transparency to investors regarding a key metric used by management. Comparable EPS growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement of or a superior measure to, EPS growth reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the constant currency note above for a summary of foreign currency exchange rate impacts.

The reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Projected 2022 comparable EPS growth outlined in the 2022 Growth and Financial Performance Outlook section of this earnings release reflects the following adjustments: (i) full year 2021 reported EPS adjusted for positive share-based compensation activity of $0.38 for full year 2021; and (ii) projected full year 2022 reported EPS adjusted for estimated positive share-based compensation activity of $0.12 and estimated negative year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate change impact of $0.08.

These impacts and those described in the constant currency note above reconcile reported EPS growth (including projected 2022 reported EPS growth) to comparable EPS growth for the Company.

Free cash flow - Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and means, with respect to a measurement period, the cash generated from operations during that period, reduced by the Company's investments in property and equipment. Management believes free cash flow is a useful measure because it indicates the cash the operations of the business are generating after appropriate reinvestment for recurring investments in property and equipment that are required to operate the business. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement of or a superior measure to, net cash provided by operating activities. See the supplementary analysis of results below for our calculation of free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. To estimate projected 2022 free cash flow, we have deducted projected purchases of property and equipment (also referred to as capital expenditures) of approximately $180 million.

Normalized free cash flow - Normalized free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and means, with respect to a measurement period, the cash generated from operations during that period, reduced by the Company's investments in property and equipment excluding major project investments. Management believes that normalized free cash flow is a useful measure because it enables better period-over-period comparisons of the cash the operations of the business are generating after appropriate reinvestment for recurring and non-recurring investments in property and equipment that are required to operate the business, excluding major project investments. Normalized free cash flow should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement of or a superior measure to, net cash provided by operating activities. To estimate projected 2022 normalized free cash flow, we have deducted projected purchases of property and equipment (also referred to as capital expenditures) of approximately $130 million, which excludes $50 million related to a new warehouse and manufacturing site expansion aligned to support our accelerated growth.

Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (Leverage Ratios) - Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt, and net debt are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-recurring transaction expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, share-based compensation expense, and certain other non-cash losses and charges. Management believes that reporting Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt and net debt in the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratios provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate the Company's business performance and available borrowing capacity under the Company's credit facility. For further information on how Adjusted EBITDA and the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratios are calculated, see the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.

After-Tax Return on Invested Capital, Excluding Cash and Investments ("ROIC") - After-Tax Return on Invested Capital, Excluding Cash and Investments, is a non-GAAP financial measure. After-tax return on invested capital, excluding cash and investments, represents our after-tax income from operations, divided by our average invested capital, excluding cash and investments, using beginning and ending balance sheet values. Management believes that reporting ROIC provides useful information to investors for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital. See the supplementary table below for reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure.

Notes and Definitions

CEO transition charges - Effective November 1, 2019, Jonathan W. Ayers, our former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, stepped down as Chairman of our Board, ceased to be an employee of the Company and transitioned to the role of external Senior Advisor to the Company. Mr. Ayers continues to serve as a member of our Board. Pursuant to a mutual separation agreement between the Company and Mr. Ayers, we recognized a charge to operating income of approximately $13.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, representing the cost of severance payments and an acceleration of the cost of his equity awards, which was offset by a reduction to our provision for income taxes of approximately $1.2 million, resulting in a total charge to net income of approximately $12.2 million, net of tax impacts.

Ongoing litigation matter - The Company established an accrual of $27.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 related to an ongoing matter involving an alleged breach of contract for underpayment of royalty payments made from 2004 through 2017 under an expired patent license agreement. The accrual amount represents the amount of a possible loss that we have determined to be probable and estimable, and the actual cost of resolving this matter may be higher or lower than the amount accrued.

Swiss tax reform impact - A one-time positive income tax impact related to the enactment of tax reform in Switzerland reflected in the fourth quarter of 2020, when the Company recorded an approximately $22 million deferred tax asset related to transitional benefits.
