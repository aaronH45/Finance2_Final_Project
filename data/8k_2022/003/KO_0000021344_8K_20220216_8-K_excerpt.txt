 Item 5.02.Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On February 16, 2022, the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee”) of The Coca-Cola Company (the “Company”) adopted amended form award agreements for performance share units, stock options and restricted stock units (the “Award Agreements”) to be granted under The Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan, as amended (the “Equity Plan”). The Award Agreements were amended to reduce the exercise time at death to one year for options, to allow vesting to continue if an individual transfers to an affiliate of the Company in certain situations, to remove proration for certain involuntary termination events and to remove the service requirement for certain vesting provisions after age 60 for all termination events, in addition to immaterial administrative updates. 

In addition, on February 16, 2022, the Committee approved the 2022 performance measures, weighting and metrics for executive officers under each of The Coca-Cola Company Performance Incentive Plan (the “Performance Incentive Plan”) and The Coca-Cola Company Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Long-Term Incentive Plan.”) 

With respect to the 2022 annual incentive award under the Performance Incentive Plan, the Committee determined to include certain goals to promote employee diversity, equity and inclusion. The new goals will collectively comprise 10% of the executives’ 2022 annual incentive under the Performance Incentive Plan, with the prior year’s measures (Net Operating Revenue Growth and Operating Income Growth) equally comprising the remaining 90%. 

With respect to the 2022 long-term incentive award under the Long-Term Incentive Program, the Committee determined to include certain measures to promote achievement of the Company’s environmental sustainability priorities. The new measures will collectively comprise 10% of the executives’ performance share unit award under the Long-Term Incentive Program, with the prior year’s measures (Net Operating Revenue Growth, Earnings per Share Growth and Cumulative Free Cash Flow) equally comprising the remaining 90%. 

The foregoing descriptions of the Award Agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Award Agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference.
