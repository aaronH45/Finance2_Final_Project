FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Tom Hill, Vulcan Materials’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our teams finished the year strong, despite ongoing challenges from inflationary pressures and labor constraints. We expanded our industry-leading unit profitability again in the fourth quarter and for the full year by continuing to focus on our operating disciplines and taking pricing actions where necessary to mitigate these headwinds. We continue to make excellent progress integrating the USCR operations into our business. This acquisition extends our growth platform in certain existing markets as well as new geographies. These results demonstrate our ability to execute on Vulcan’s four strategic disciplines and enhance our operating leverage moving forward. We are well positioned to capitalize on the positive demand trends we see developing in 2022 and beyond.” 

Mr. Hill continued, “As demand and the pricing environment continue to strengthen, we expect healthy growth in unit profitability again in 2022. Robust growth in aggregates pricing and a continued focus on operational excellence will more than offset anticipated inflationary pressures. In our asphalt business, we expect recent pricing efforts to begin to mitigate higher liquid asphalt costs and lead to gross profit margin improvement beginning in the second half of 2022. In concrete, improvement in private nonresidential construction activity will help drive earnings growth in 2022.” 

Highlights as of December 31, 2021 include:

Segment Results 

Aggregates 

For the fourth quarter, gross profit increased 18 percent to $326 million, or $5.64 per ton. Cash gross profit per ton improved 6 percent from the prior year to $7.41. The year-over-year earnings improvement was widespread across the Company’s footprint and resulted from both volume and price growth, as well as effective cost control. This year’s fourth quarter results included an $8 million unfavorable impact from selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of the USCR acquisition and a $15 million unfavorable impact from significantly higher diesel fuel costs. 

Total aggregates shipments increased 13 percent (7 percent on a same-store basis), reflecting improving demand across all end-market segments as well as the benefit of favorable weather in certain markets during November and December. As demand visibility improved, the pricing environment continued to strengthen, and the rate of pricing growth improved sequentially each quarter this year. In the fourth quarter, same-store freight-adjusted pricing increased 3.7 percent year-over-year (mix-adjusted pricing increased 4.2 percent) with the growth widespread across geographies. 

Solid operational execution offset higher year-over-year costs for diesel fuel, inflation for certain parts and supplies, and operational disruptions caused by labor shortages. Freight-adjusted unit cash cost of sales increased 1 percent as compared to the prior year’s fourth quarter. 

For the full year, cash unit profitability increased 5 percent from the prior year to $7.43 per ton. This year-over-year improvement was driven by 7 percent volume growth, 3 percent price growth and effective cost control despite a more than 50 percent increase in diesel fuel prices. Positive pricing opportunities and improved operating efficiencies are expected to continue to help offset some of the cost inflation going forward. 

Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium 

Asphalt segment gross profit was $4 million in the quarter compared to $17 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in earnings was driven by higher costs for liquid asphalt ($17 million impact). The average cost of liquid asphalt during the fourth quarter was 35 percent higher than the prior year’s fourth quarter when liquid prices were at a three-year low. Average selling prices for asphalt mix increased 5 percent, or $2.80 per ton, versus the prior year’s fourth quarter as pricing actions initiated earlier in the year gained traction. Sequential price growth in asphalt mix eclipsed 2 percent per quarter since the sharp jump in liquid asphalt costs experienced late in the second quarter. Asphalt volumes declined 1 percent in California and Arizona (the Company’s two largest asphalt markets) while volumes increased in Alabama, New Mexico, Tennessee, and parts of Texas. Overall, asphalt shipments declined by 1 percent. 

For the full year, Asphalt gross profit decreased from $75 million in the prior year to $21 million. The year-over-year change in gross profit was primarily due to sharply higher costs for liquid asphalt ($41 million impact) and a rise in natural gas prices ($6 million impact). Asphalt volumes decreased 4 percent from the prior year. Volume growth in California, the Company’s largest asphalt market, was more than offset by lower volumes in Arizona, the Company’s second largest market. Efforts to mitigate the earnings impact of persistent energy inflation will continue with positive results in price growth expected to contribute to unit profitability improvement in 2022.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Fourth quarter Concrete segment gross profit increased from $9 million in the prior year to $22 million. Segment results benefited from higher shipments and price growth in the Company’s legacy operations as well as the contribution from USCR operations. Material margins improved as higher selling prices helped offset higher raw materials costs, including aggregates supplied by the Company. Segment results were negatively impacted by higher diesel prices and the availability of drivers in certain markets. 

For the full year, Concrete gross profit increased $10 million to $54 million. Earnings contributions from USCR operations more than offset the earnings impact from lower volumes in the Company’s legacy Virginia operations. The lower volumes were due mostly to the timing of several large projects that were completed in the prior year. Material margins increased in the Company’s legacy operations despite lower volumes. 

Calcium segment gross profit was $0.3 million compared to $1.2 million in the prior year quarter. 

Selling, Administrative and General (SAG) and Other Items 

SAG expense was $125 million in the quarter, or 7.8 percent of total revenues, and included overhead expenses associated with the USCR business that were not in the prior year’s quarter. Additionally, increased routine business development activities and more normalized travel expenses, due in part to integration activities, contributed to the year-over-year increase. Full year SAG expense was $418 million, or 7.5 percent of total revenues. 

For the full year, gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses was $120 million. This total amount included the sale of a reclaimed quarry in Southern California during the first quarter of 2021. The transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $115 million, or $0.64 per diluted share. The Company remains focused on its efforts to maximize the value of its portfolio of quarry operations as they move through their life-cycle of land management. 

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Allocation 

Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $173 million, including maintenance and growth projects as well as USCR. For the full year, capital expenditures were $465 million, including $170 million for growth projects. In 2022, the Company expects to spend $600 to $650 million, including growth and capacity-adding projects. These amounts also include spending for USCR operations acquired in August 2021. The Company will continue to review its plans and will adjust as needed, while being thoughtful about preserving liquidity. 

At December 31, 2021, the ratio of total debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 2.7 times (2.5 times on a net debt basis). The Company remains committed to its stated long-term target leverage range of 2.0 to 2.5 times total debt to Adjusted EBITDA.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Interest expense, net of interest income, was $36 million in the fourth quarter compared with $34 million in the prior year. Interest expense, net of interest income, for the full year was $148 million compared to $134 million in the prior year. This full year increase includes financing costs associated with the USCR acquisition and is consistent with the Company’s full year expectations. 

On a trailing-twelve-month basis, return on invested capital was 14.2 percent. The Company remains committed to driving further improvement through solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management. 

Outlook 

Regarding the Company’s 2022 expectations, Mr. Hill said, “With a strong finish in the fourth quarter, we carry considerable momentum into the new year. Our markets are poised to outperform other parts of the country as demand continues to improve, and our industry-leading unit profitability increases with each passing quarter. We will continue to drive substantial value through the combination of our legacy business and the acquisition of USCR. Residential construction remains strong, and contract awards for private nonresidential buildings are growing again. On the public side, infrastructure investment is moving forward, and we are well positioned in attractive growth markets where the need is greatest. That said, labor shortages and supply chain disruptions are expected to continue to limit shipment growth in 2022. We expect the favorable pricing dynamics that improved throughout 2021 to be even better in 2022 and lead to attractive growth in aggregates unit profitability. Growing our aggregates unit profitability consistently during the last two years of pandemic-related disruptions demonstrates the resiliency of our business and our ability to capitalize on any changes in the macro environment.” 

Management expectations for 2022 include: 

 ·Net earnings attributable to Vulcan of between $800 to $890 million 

 ·Adjusted EBITDA of between $1.720 to $1.820 billion 

 ·High single-digit growth in Aggregates cash gross profit per ton ($7.43 in 2021) 

 oTotal shipment growth of 5 to 7 percent (222.9 million tons in 2021) 

 oFreight-adjusted price increase of 6 to 8 percent ($14.87 per ton in 2021) 

 oMid-single digit increase in freight-adjusted cash cost (freight-adjusted price less segment cash gross profit per ton; $7.44 per ton in 2021) due to higher energy-related costs (mostly diesel fuel) and continued inflationary pressures in other areas 

 ·Cash gross profit of $300 to $325 million in Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium collectively 

 oConcrete segment expected to account for approximately 75 percent of the total due to a full year of results from USCR operations as well as margin improvement in the Company’s legacy operations 

 oAsphalt earnings improvement driven by volume growth and price improvement. Higher prices for asphalt mix in the second half of 2022 are expected to reduce the earnings impact of higher liquid asphalt costs and natural gas used in production 

 ·SAG expenses of $485 to $495 million, including a full year of USCR 

 ·Interest expense of approximately $150 million 

 ·Depreciation, depletion, accretion, and amortization expense of approximately $540 million 

 ·An effective tax rate of 21 to 22 percent

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Mexico Update 

Since late 2018 and as previously disclosed, Vulcan has been engaged in a NAFTA arbitration with Mexico over Mexico’s repudiation of an agreement to unlock a portion of Vulcan’s reserves in Mexico and the arbitrary shutdown of a portion of our quarrying operations there. A hearing took place in July 2021, and we expect a decision in the second half of 2022. 

While we await the final resolution from the NAFTA tribunal, we have continued to engage with government officials to pursue an amicable resolution of the dispute. Recently, however, Mexico has taken additional actions that adversely affect our operations in Mexico, including delays in issuing a historically routine three-year customs permit for our deep-water port at Punta Venado. Mexico has issued a short-term customs permit that must be renewed after two months. 

Failure by the Mexican government to issue the customary three-year customs permit or its taking of any other measures that force us to cease operations in Mexico would have an adverse effect on our ability to supply customers. We continue to negotiate with the Mexican authorities to reach a mutually agreeable and beneficial solution. 

The Company has quarried limestone legally in Mexico – on land that it owns – for over 30 years. Vulcan is the sole owner of four lots of land south of Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, that together form its “Sac Tun” operation, formerly known as Calica. Vulcan has the right to maintain full property ownership over these lots, owns the limestone reserves in these lots, and complies and has always complied with Mexican law, including the laws and permitting regulating the extraction, processing and exportation of limestone.

1. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 

Aggregates segment freight-adjusted revenues is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) measure and should not be considered as an alternative to metrics defined by GAAP. We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight & delivery, which are pass-through activities. It also excludes other revenues related to services, such as landfill tipping fees, that are derived from our aggregates business. Additionally, we use this metric as the basis for calculating the average sales price of our aggregates products. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:

 (in millions, except per ton data) 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1At the segment level, freight & delivery revenues include intersegment freight & delivery (which are eliminated at the consolidated level) and freight to remote distribution sites.  

Aggregates segment incremental gross profit flow-through rate is not a GAAP measure and represents the year-over-year change in gross profit divided by the year-over-year change in segment sales excluding freight & delivery (revenues and costs). This metric should not be considered as an alternative to metrics defined by GAAP. We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight & delivery, which are pass-through activities.

 Appendix 2 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures (Continued) 

GAAP does not define "Aggregates segment cash gross profit" and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We and the investment community use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business. Additionally, we present this metric as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. Aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton is computed by dividing Aggregates segment cash gross profit by tons shipped. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: 

Aggregates Segment Cash Gross Profit 

 (in millions, except per ton data) 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

GAAP does not define "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization" (EBITDA) and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. We adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of earnings performance from period to period. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below (numbers may not foot due to rounding): 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 

 (in millions) 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1Represents non-routine charges or gains associated with acquisitions and dispositions. Costs in 2021 include USCR acquisition related expenses of $22.0 million and the cost impact of purchase accounting inventory valuations of $10.7 million.  

 2These costs include $5.1 million related to our COVID-19 vaccination incentive program initiated in 2021.  

Similar to our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, we present Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) attributable to Vulcan from continuing operations to provide a more consistent comparison of earnings performance from period to period. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:

 Appendix 3 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures (Continued) 

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure and should not be considered as an alternative to metrics defined by GAAP. We, the investment community and credit rating agencies use this metric to assess our leverage. Net debt subtracts cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash from total debt. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: 

Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 

 (in millions) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following reconciliation to the mid-point of the range of 2022 Projected EBITDA excludes adjustments (as noted in Adjusted EBITDA above) as they are difficult to forecast (timing or amount). Due to the difficulty in forecasting such adjustments, we are unable to estimate their significance. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: 

2022 Projected EBITDA 

 (in millions) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We define “Return on Invested Capital” (ROIC) as Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing-twelve months divided by average invested capital (as illustrated below) during the trailing 5-quarters. Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric EBITDA. We believe that our ROIC metric is meaningful because it helps investors assess how effectively we are deploying our assets. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:
