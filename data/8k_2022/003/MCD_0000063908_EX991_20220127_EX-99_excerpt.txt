FOURTH QUARTER COMPARABLE SALES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Comparable Sales: Quarterly comparable sales and guest counts were positive across all segments. Comparable sales were impacted in both periods (to a greater extent in 2020) by COVID-19.

•U.S.: Comparable sales benefited from strong average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases. Strong menu and marketing promotions, such as the McRib and Crispy Chicken Sandwich, and growth in digital channels, driven by the Company's loyalty program, also contributed to the comparable sales growth. Comparable sales increased 13.4% on a 2-year basis.

•International Operated Markets: Strong operating performance and fewer restaurant closures associated with COVID-19 drove very strong positive comparable sales in France, the U.K., Italy and Germany. COVID-related government restrictions in the quarter resulted in relatively flat comparable sales in Australia. Comparable sales increased 8.2% on a 2-year basis.

•International Developmental Licensed Markets: The quarter reflected strong comparable sales across the segment, partly offset by negative comparable sales in China due to continued COVID-19 resurgences. Comparable sales increased 10.1% on a 2-year basis.

COVID-19 continued to result in varying levels of government restrictions on restaurant operating hours, limited dine-in capacity and, in some cases, dining room closures. The Company has applied appropriate precautionary measures, including following the guidance of expert health authorities, and will continue to adapt and enhance its approach in order to protect the safety and well-being of its customers and people. 

KEY FINANCIAL METRICS - CONSOLIDATED

Dollars in millions, except per share data 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Results for the quarter and year reflected stronger operating performance across all segments due to higher sales-driven restaurant margins as we continue to execute on our Accelerating the Arches strategy.

•$364 million, or $0.48 per share, of income tax benefits for the year, which related to the remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of a change in the U.K. statutory income tax rate.

Results for 2020 included the following:

THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AS USED THROUGHOUT THIS RELEASE

Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other strategic charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.

Comparable sales are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters (including restaurants temporarily closed due to COVID-19). Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyper-inflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. 

Comparable guest counts represent the number of transactions at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. 

Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. This includes sales from digital channels, which are comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk at both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. 

Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
