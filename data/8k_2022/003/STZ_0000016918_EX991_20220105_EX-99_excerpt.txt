HIGHLIGHTS

•Despite difficult year-over-year volume comparisons, Constellation’s Beer Business posted depletion growth of more than 8%, driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and explosive growth from Corona Extra. Depletion volume selling days were flat year-over-year.

•In IRI channels, Constellation's Beer Business further strengthened its position as the #1 supplier in the high-end and was the #1 dollar share gainer, adding 1.3 market share points during the quarter.

•Modelo Especial achieved 13% depletion growth and continued to be the #1 brand in the high-end and #1 brand share gainer in the entire U.S. beer category in IRI dollar sales; Modelo Chelada posted 35% depletion growth and is now the #1 Chelada in the U.S. beer market.

•Corona Extra reported depletion growth of 11% and remained the #2 import share gainer and #3 brand in the high-end in IRI channels.

•Operating margin decreased 130 basis points to 41.3%, as benefits from favorable pricing and timing of marketing spend were more than offset by increased COGS driven by expected higher material and brewery costs, as well as increased depreciation.

•Cases shipped exceeded cases depleted as distributor inventory levels began to rebuild during the quarter. Product inventories are expected to return to normal levels by the end of the fiscal year, as cases shipped are expected to continue to exceed cases depleted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

•The Beer Business now expects 10 - 11% net sales growth and 6 - 7% operating income growth for fiscal 2022 reflecting the strong performance of the core beer portfolio.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(2) Three months ended November 30, 2020, includes $210.3 million of net sales and $73.8 million of gross profit less marketing that are no longer part of the wine and spirits segment results.

HIGHLIGHTS

•The Prisoner Brand Family, Kim Crawford, and Meiomi continued to outpace their respective price segments while contributing to Constellation share gains in the high-end of the U.S. wine market.

•Constellation's Wine and Spirits Business innovation strategy continued to gain traction as Kim Crawford Illuminate and The Prisoner Unshackled were among the top five share gainers in their respective price segments in IRI channels.

•In the 3-Tier eCommerce channel, Constellation’s Wine Business significantly outpaced the U.S. wine market by double-digits, led by 27% growth for Meiomi. Nearly 10% of Meiomi’s sales are generated in the 3-Tier eCommerce channel which is the highest level among leading U.S. wine brands in IRI eCommerce channels.

•Operating margin increased 140 basis points to 25.4% as decreased COGS driven by favorable fixed cost absorption, mix benefits from divestitures, and favorable price were partially offset by increased marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales and unfavorable mix from the existing portfolio.

BEER BUSINESS CAPITAL EXPANSION

The company has updated its plans to invest in the next increment of capacity in Mexico that will provide the long-term flexibility needed to support the expected future growth of its high-end Mexican beer portfolio. Total capital expenditures for the Beer Business are now expected to be $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion over fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, with the majority of spend expected to occur in the first three years of that timeframe. The investment will support an additional 25 million to 30 million hectoliters of total capacity and includes construction of a new brewery in Southeast Mexico in the state of Veracruz, as well as continued expansion and optimization at the company's existing sites in Nava and Obregon. This capital investment of $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion includes the previously disclosed capital expenditures guidance of $700 million to $900 million annually for fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we recorded a $666 million impairment on the Mexicali facility, which is included above in the fiscal 2022 reported basis EPS guidance. The company continues to work with government officials in Mexico to (i) determine next steps for our suspended Mexicali Brewery construction project and (ii) pursue various forms of recovery for capitalized costs and additional expenses incurred in establishing the brewery, however, there can be no assurance of any recoveries.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

Reported basis (“reported”) are amounts as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Comparable basis (“comparable”) are amounts which exclude items that affect comparability (“comparable adjustments”), as they are not reflective of core operations of the segments. The company’s measure of segment profitability excludes comparable adjustments, which is consistent with the measure used by management to evaluate results. The company discusses various non-GAAP measures in this news release. Financial statements, as well as supplemental schedules and tables reconciling non-GAAP measures, together with definitions of these measures and the reasons management uses these measures, are included in this news release.

The statements made under the heading Outlook and all statements other than statements of historical fact set forth in this news release regarding Constellation Brands’ business strategy, future operations and business, future financial position, expected effective tax rates and anticipated tax liabilities, estimated revenues, projected costs and expenses, expected net sales and operating income, estimated diluted EPS, expected capital expenditures, expected operating cash flow and free cash flow, future payments of dividends, amount, manner and timing of share repurchases under the share repurchase authorization, and prospects, plans and objectives of management, as well as information concerning expected actions of third parties, are forward-looking statements (collectively, the “Projections”) that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the Projections.

During the current quarter, Constellation Brands may reiterate the Projections. Prior to the start of the company’s quiet period, which will begin at the close of business on February 28, 2022, the public can continue to rely on the Projections as still being Constellation Brands’ current expectations on the matters covered, unless the company publishes a notice stating otherwise. During Constellation Brands’ “quiet period,” the Projections should not be considered to constitute the company’s expectations and should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update by the company.

The Projections are based on management’s current expectations and, unless otherwise noted, do not take into account the impact of any future acquisition, investment, merger, or any other business combination, divestiture, restructuring, or other strategic business realignments, financing or share repurchase that may be completed after the date of this release, or any incremental contingent consideration payment paid or any specific amount of incremental contingent consideration payment received, if any, in association with the Wine and Spirits Divestitures. The Projections should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results will in fact occur. The actual impact of COVID-19 and its associated operating environment may be materially different than management’s expectations.

In addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations, the Projections of the company contained in this news release are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:

•duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to the impact and severity of new variants, vaccine efficacy and immunization rates, the closure of non-essential businesses, which may include our manufacturing facilities, and other associated governmental containment actions, quarantines, or curfews, and the increase in cyber-security attacks that have occurred while non-production employees work remotely;

•raw material and water supply, production, or shipment difficulties could adversely affect our ability to supply our customers;

•the actual impact to supply, production levels, and costs due to wildfires, severe weather events, global supply chain logistics, and transportation challenges may vary from our current expectations due to, among other reasons, the actual severity and geographical reach of wildfires and severe weather events and actual supply chain and transportation performance;

•impact of the Wine and Spirits Divestitures, the Concentrate Business Divestiture, and the Paul Masson Divestiture, and amount and timing of cost reductions, if any, may vary from management’s current expectations;

•amount of contingent consideration, if any, received in the Wine and Spirits Divestitures will depend on actual future brand performance;

•beer operations expansion, construction, and optimization activities, scope, capacity, costs, capital expenditures, and timing associated with these activities, and amount of impairment or other costs and expenses from non-recoverable brewery construction assets in Mexico may vary from management’s current estimates due to market conditions, our cash and debt position, receipt of regulatory approvals on the expected dates and terms, results of discussions with government officials in Mexico, actual amount of non-recoverable brewery construction assets and other costs, and other factors determined by management;

•accuracy of supply projections, including those relating to wine and spirits operating activities, beer operations expansion activities, product inventory levels, and glass sourcing;

•operating cash flow, free cash flow, effective tax rate, and capital expenditures to support long-term growth may vary from management’s current estimates;

•accuracy of projections associated with market opportunities, new products, and previously announced acquisitions, investments, and divestitures;

•accuracy of projections relating to the Canopy investment may vary from management’s current expectations;

•exact duration of the share repurchase implementation and the amount, timing, and source of funds for any share repurchases;

•general economic, geo-political, domestic, international, and regulatory conditions, instability in world financial markets, inflation, health epidemics or pandemics, unanticipated environmental liabilities and costs, or enhanced competitive activities;

•changes to international trade agreements and tariffs, accounting standards, elections or assertions, tax laws or other governmental rules and regulations, and other factors which could impact the company’s reported financial position, results of operations, effective tax rate, or accuracy of any associated Projections;

•changes in interest rates and the inherent unpredictability of currency fluctuations, commodity prices, and raw materials; and

•other factors and uncertainties disclosed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, which could cause actual future performance to differ from current expectations.
