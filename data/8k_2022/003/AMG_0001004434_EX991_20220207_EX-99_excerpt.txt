WEST PALM BEACH, FL, February 7, 2022 — Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE: AMG) today reported its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021.

Jay C. Horgen, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMG, said:

“AMG generated excellent results in 2021, including year-over-year growth of 33% in Adjusted EBITDA and 37% in Economic Earnings per Share, given strong Affiliate investment performance, and the positive impact of new investments and share repurchases. Client cash flows were positive for the quarter and full year, excluding certain quantitative strategies. Liquid and illiquid alternative strategies generated $12 billion in net inflows during the quarter, reflecting AMG's strategic business evolution toward secular growth areas. As we continue to increase AMG's participation in growth areas — including private markets, specialty fixed income, wealth management, Asia, and ESG — we are well-positioned for future growth.

“In 2021, we successfully executed on our growth strategy, in partnering with new Affiliates, accelerating growth at our existing Affiliates, and enhancing our strategic capabilities. We were pleased to welcome four high-quality Affiliates over the last 12 months, including private real estate manager Abacus, ESG-dedicated managers Parnassus Investments and Boston Common Asset Management, and private credit manager OCP Asia. In addition, we recently increased our investment in Systematica, one of the industry's largest woman-owned and -led alternative firms. Our recent new investment activity reflects increasing demand for AMG's proven range of partnership solutions, which today includes growth capital, distribution, and succession planning — and looking ahead, AMG's unique approach will continue to attract independent managers seeking a strategic partner that can enhance their long-term growth and competitive positioning.

“Given our strong execution in 2021 and resulting significant business momentum, the quality and diversity of our Affiliates, and our disciplined approach to capital deployment, we entered 2022 with increased earnings power, a strong and flexible balance sheet, and an outstanding opportunity to drive further earnings growth and generate significant long-term value for our shareholders."

Notes

(1) Earnings per share (diluted) adjusts for the dilutive effect of the potential issuance of incremental shares of our common stock. We had junior convertible securities outstanding during the periods presented and are required to apply the if-converted method to these securities in our calculation of Earnings per share (diluted). Under the if-converted method, shares that are issuable upon conversion are deemed outstanding, regardless of whether the securities are contractually convertible into our common stock at that time. For this calculation, the interest expense (net of tax) attributable to these dilutive securities is added back to Net income (controlling interest), reflecting the assumption that the securities have been converted. Issuable shares for these securities and related interest expense are excluded from the calculation if an assumed conversion would be anti-dilutive to diluted earnings per share.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

(2) As supplemental information, we provide non-GAAP performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest), Economic net income (controlling interest), and Economic earnings per share. Management utilizes these non-GAAP performance measures to assess our performance before our share of certain non-cash expenses and to improve comparability between periods. 

Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments, certain Affiliate equity expenses, certain gains and losses, including on general partner and seed capital investments, and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. We believe that many investors use this non-GAAP measure when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry.

Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method investments in Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment obligations), certain Affiliate equity expenses, and certain gains and losses, including on general partner and seed capital investments. Economic net income (controlling interest) is used by management and our Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmark, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. 

Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our junior convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of the junior convertible securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted):

These non-GAAP performance measures are provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest), Earnings per share or other GAAP performance measures. For additional information on our non-GAAP measures, see our Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
