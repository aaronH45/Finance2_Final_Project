RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND REGULATION G DISCLOSURE

Table 2 includes additional measures of income from continuing operations, net income, net income margin, segment operating income (loss) and segment operating income (loss) margin provided to supplement our selected historical financial information calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). L3Harris management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. L3Harris management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze L3Harris’ business trends and to understand L3Harris’ performance. In addition, L3Harris may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in its forecasting, budgeting, and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. The notes accompanying Table 2 provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
