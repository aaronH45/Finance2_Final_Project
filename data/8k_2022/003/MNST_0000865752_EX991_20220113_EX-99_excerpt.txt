6 ESG The Company published its first Sustainability Report in August 2021**. Over 95% of the Company’s products are sold in aluminum cans, which are 100% recyclable. Approximately 73% of each can is sourced from recycled beverage containers. The Company has achieved LEED certification in most U.S. Company owned buildings. The Company conducted a climate change risk assessment and completed an inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions. The Company has its own recycling symbol, which has been added to all new products and will be integrated into existing products globally on a rolling basis. ** Content on the Company’s website, including the Company’s sustainability report, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, part of this filing or incorporated herein or into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

7 ESG In 2021, the Company responded to the CDP questionnaires on Water Security and Climate Change, which reported on the Company’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from its U.S. operations. In the KnowTheChain food & beverage rankings, the Company now ranks 23 out of 43, showing significant improvement since 2018. American Fruits and Flavors, a wholly owned subsidiary, earned a Ecovadis Silver Medal, ranking in the top 30% of companies assessed. The Company has established an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Leadership Advisory Group and regional EDI Councils in the Americas, EMEA and APAC.

8 GLOBAL PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT 2021 HIGHLIGHTS COVID-19 PANDEMIC To aid in the effort for global vaccinations, MECares supported Team Rubicon, which provides medical aid to underdeveloped countries, to slow and stop the spread of Covid-19 to those in most need. U.S. TROOPS AND ALLIED FORCES MECares continued to support military responses around the globe in 2021. Support was given to troops deployed to assist with national disasters, civil unrest, the U.S. Presidential Inauguration, and the Afghanistan withdrawal. Through the USO, MECares provides ongoing support to troops stationed around the globe. MECares also supports charities who give educational scholarships to veterans, their spouses, and children through a few key charities. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES MECares works with our own athlete ambassadors to support their causes. DONATED OVER 2.75 MILLION PRODUCTS TO FIRST RESPONDERS, NATURAL DISASTER AREAS AND PANDEMIC RELIEF GLOBALLY

9 GLOBAL PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT 2021 HIGHLIGHTS GLOBAL EXPANSION MECares EMEA was formed to support our global philanthropic expansion, in the United Kingdom, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

10 SUPPLY CHAIN In 2021 the Company experienced a number of challenges as a result of unanticipated increases in demand, which adversely impacted sales as well as operating costs and affected the availability of our products on shelves at retailers. The Company has addressed and continues to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain, which remains largely intact. In 2021 the Company: • Experienced shortages in its aluminum can requirements, lack of availability of certain ingredients from time to time, as well as insufficient canning capacity in the United States and in EMEA. In EMEA specifically, there was also a shortage of trucking availability. • Experienced increased import costs for aluminum cans, ingredients, shipping and freight, labor, fuel, and co-packing fees, all of which resulted in increased operating costs. • Continues to implement measures to mitigate such increased costs through pricing actions and reductions in promotions.

11 SUPPLY CHAIN Additional can manufacturing capacity in the United States has been secured for 2022, although the Company will continue to import aluminum cans to supplement its domestic can supply. Can capacity in EMEA remains challenging and the Company expects to continue to import aluminum cans into EMEA for at least 2022. Co-packing capacity in the United States and EMEA continues to be challenging. The Company has expanded its network in the US and EMEA to substantially address supply constraints. The Company’s flavor facility in Athy, Ireland is operational and producing certain flavors and blends for the EMEA region and is steadily increasing production. Athy is also investigating the feasibility of a juice plant to produce EMEA’s juice product requirements.
