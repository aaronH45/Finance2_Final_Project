Item 8.01. Other Events.

On February 1, 2022, Alphabet today announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-one stock split (the “Stock Split”) in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Class B Common Stock”) and Class C capital stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Class C Capital Stock”). The Stock Split is subject to stockholder approval of an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock to accommodate the Stock Split (the “Charter Amendment”). The Company expects to include the Charter Amendment as an item of business at the Company’s upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders, to be held on or about June 1, 2022 (the “Annual Meeting”). 

If the Company’s stockholders approve the Charter Amendment at the Company’s upcoming Annual Meeting, the Company expects to implement the Charter Amendment and the Stock Split following the Annual Meeting. In connection with the Stock Split, each of the Company’s stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022 (the “Record Date”) will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022: (i) 19 additional shares of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class A Common Stock held by such stockholder as of the Record Date; (ii) 19 additional shares of Class B Common Stock for each share of Class B Common Stock held by such stockholder as of the Record Date; and (iii) 19 additional shares of Class C Capital Stock for each share of Class C Capital Stock held by such stockholder as of the Record Date. 

A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

This information shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
