CBRE GROUP, INC. REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR Q4 AND FULL YEAR 2021 

•FY 2021 GAAP EPS climbed 143% to $5.41

•FY 2021 Adjusted EPS, less SPAC-related gain, rose 67% to $5.45

Dallas, TX – February 24, 2022 — CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021. The company set new annual and quarterly milestones with revenue, net revenue, earnings and free cash flow reaching all-time highs.

“We had a strong finish to 2021, significantly outperforming both fourth-quarter 2020 and the pre-pandemic peak in fourth-quarter 2019. This capped an outstanding year of performance for CBRE,” said Bob Sulentic, CBRE’s president and chief executive officer. 

“We’ve positioned the company over the past several years to enhance resiliency and capitalize on secular tailwinds by successfully diversifying our business across four dimensions – asset types, lines of business, clients and geographies. Our strong results benefited from this work, as well as from our healthy balance sheet and the supportive macro environment.” 

Reflecting its strong 2021 performance and future growth opportunities, CBRE has increased its multi-year aspirational growth framework. For the period from 2020 to 2025, the company now expects average annual core adjusted earnings per share growth to exceed 20%, absent a recession. The average annual growth rate is expected to be in the low double digits for the period from 2021 to 2025. The expected growth rates have meaningful upside from potential incremental capital allocation.

GAAP earnings per share totaled $2.04 for the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings per share totaled $2.19. Both measures include an approximate 7-cent negative impact from an increase in a reserve previously taken on a UK development project that had been adversely affected earlier in the pandemic. GAAP and adjusted earnings per share also include a 36-cent non-cash gain related to the company’s investment in Altus Power, Inc. through its SPAC. Excluding the SPAC-related gain, which is comparable to how the company reported financial results in prior periods, adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.83.

Consolidated Financial Results Overview

The following table presents highlights of CBRE performance (dollars in millions, except per share data):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Core adjusted EPS excludes the financial impact of strategic non-core equity investments not attributable to a business segment and is comprised of Altus Power, Inc. and VC-related investments. This metric is provided to enhance transparency of the performance of both the company’s core operations and strategic non-core investments. Fourth-quarter 2021 core adjusted EPS excludes a 36-cent gain related to the company’s Altus investment and a 3-cent gain related to fair-value changes of non-core investments.

Advisory Services Segment

The following table presents highlights of the Advisory Services segment performance (dollars in millions, totals may not add due to rounding):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Strong fourth quarter performance resulted from revenue growth across most business lines, led by high-margin property sales and leasing, as well as cost mitigation actions taken in 2020.

Global sales revenue rose 73% (74% local currency) from last year’s fourth quarter and was 45% above the fourth-quarter 2019 peak. The United States paced the rebound among major markets, with revenue rising 89% versus fourth-quarter 2020 and 74% versus fourth-quarter 2019. CBRE’s investment sales market share improved 100 basis points from last year’s fourth quarter to a market-leading 17.5%, according to Real Capital Analytics. International sales revenue was also above fourth-quarter 2019 levels, led by Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom. Across the globe, investment activity remained strong for industrial and multifamily properties, while office and retail property sales showed sequential improvement. Retail sales acceleration was particularly notable, with revenue well above fourth-quarter 2019 levels. 

Global leasing revenue rose 60% (same local currency) from fourth-quarter 2020 and 14% from the fourth-quarter 2019 peak, with continued strong industrial property demand. In the United States, leasing revenue climbed 77% compared with fourth-quarter 2020 and 14% from the fourth-quarter 2019 peak, with office leasing showing continued sequential improvement but still slightly below the 2019 level. In the United Kingdom, leasing revenue rose 59% (55% local currency) and 45%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Commercial mortgage origination revenue slipped 3% (same local currency) compared with a particularly robust fourth-quarter 2020. This slight decline was due to lower gains on mortgage origination servicing rights from loans sourced for the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). GSE origination activity faced a tough comparison with the prior-year fourth quarter, when the government agencies were extremely active in providing liquidity to a pandemic-pressured multifamily market. As a result, GSE mortgage servicing gains fell over 50% compared with the prior-year period. Aside from these lower gains, mortgage origination revenue grew 29% as activity with private lenders accelerated.

Continued growth in the loan servicing portfolio and an active financing market led to a 36% (same local currency) increase in loan servicing revenue. The portfolio increased 10% from third-quarter 2021 to end 2021 at approximately $330 billion. Valuation revenue rose 10% (same local currency), driven by the United States and Australia. Property management revenue rose 5% (same local currency) compared with fourth-quarter 2020.

Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) Segment

of revenue from Turner & Townsend, legacy GWS revenue rose 8% (7% local currency) and net revenue increased 10% (same local currency).

Facilities management, which is largely contractual, saw 6% (5% local currency) revenue growth, driven by increased activity with local clients. Project management revenue rose 17% (same local currency), excluding Turner & Townsend contributions. This growth reflected the continued revival of construction activity and capital spending projects. 

GWS segment operating profit increased $18 million from the prior-year quarter to $198 million. Turner & Townsend contributed over $23 million of operating profit, which is in-line with the company’s previously communicated expectations. Legacy segment results also reflect higher medical insurance claims relative to the prior-year quarter and about $3 million of non-cash deferred purchase consideration expense related to the remaining payments for the Turner & Townsend transaction. 

Real Estate Investments (REI) Segment 

The following table presents highlights of the REI segment performance (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

REI produced record segment operating profit for the fourth quarter. Global real estate development operating profit (9) surged 74% (73% local currency) to more than $120 million. A strong pace of industrial asset sales at high valuations more than offset the previously referenced increase in the reserve for a UK development project. 

The development pipeline totaled $9.3 billion and the in-process portfolio ended the year at $18.5 billion, a record level and up $1.6 billion from third-quarter 2021. Industrial and multifamily assets largely comprise both the in-process portfolio and pipeline.

Investment management revenue was roughly level with fourth-quarter 2020 at approximately $150 million. Asset management fees rose 21% (20% local currency), reflecting a strong increase in assets under management (AUM), and higher transaction fees. This was offset by a decline in carried interest revenue, which can be volatile, and totaled less than $8 million, down from $32 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating profit(9) was down less than expected, falling 28% (same local currency) to approximately $41 million, due to strong net promote and co-investment returns. 

AUM grew 7% from third-quarter 2021 to end the year at approximately $141.9 billion, a record high for the company. Gains in asset valuations and positive net inflows led to an $8.8 billion ($9.4 billion local currency) increase in AUM over the quarter. More than 80% of the AUM is invested in assets other than office.

Corporate and Other Segment 

The Corporate and Other segment produced profit of $25 million, driven by about $169 million of net gains from deconsolidation of the SPAC upon its merger with and into Altus Power, Inc. and subsequent fair value mark-to-market on this investment as well as other strategic non-core equity investments. Corporate overhead expenses roughly doubled from the prior-year fourth quarter and totaled $143 million. Approximately $27 million of this increase was driven by higher incentive compensation, as performance materially exceeded initial 2021 expectations. Higher corporate overhead also reflects investments in key corporate functions to help support a larger business.

Capital Allocation Overview

•Free Cash Flow – During the fourth quarter of 2021, free cash flow increased 24% to $1.1 billion. This reflected cash from operating activities of $1.2 billion, less total capital expenditures of $88.4 million. Net capital expenditures totaled $75.9 million. (10)

•Stock Repurchase Program – The company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for $184.6 million ($102.72 average price per share) during the fourth quarter of 2021, and 3.95 million shares for $372.9 million ($94.30 average price per share) during all of 2021. There is approximately $1.9 billion of capacity remaining under the company’s authorized stock repurchase program as of February 23, 2022.

•Acquisitions and Investments – The previously announced 60% ownership interest in Turner & Townsend Holdings Limited was acquired for approximately $1.27 billion, net of cash received. The initial payment for the Turner & Townsend transaction was funded with cash on hand of $722.6 million. The remaining payments totaling $591.2 million will be made in 2024 and 2025. In addition, the company made in-fill acquisitions totaling $37.5 million in cash and deferred consideration during the fourth quarter.

Leverage and Financing Overview

•Leverage – The company’s net leverage ratio (net cash (11) to trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA) was (0.24x) as of December 31, 2021, which is substantially below the company’s primary debt covenant of 4.25x. The net leverage ratio is computed as follows (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Liquidity – As of December 31, 2021, the company had approximately $5.5 billion of total liquidity, consisting of approximately $2.3 billion in cash, plus the ability to borrow an aggregate of approximately $3.2 billion under its revolving credit facilities, net of any outstanding letters of credit.

We have also included in that section reconciliations of these measures in specific periods to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for those periods.

Totals may not sum in tables in millions included in this release due to rounding.

Note: We have not reconciled the (non-GAAP) core adjusted earnings per share forward-looking guidance included in this presentation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to costs related to acquisitions, carried interest incentive compensation and financing costs, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

(1)Local currency percentage change is calculated by comparing current-period results at prior-period exchange rates versus prior-period results.

(2)Net revenue is gross revenue less costs largely associated with subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. These costs are reimbursable by clients and generally have no margin.

(3)Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings, inclusive of non-controlling interest, before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, asset impairments, adjustments related to certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the acquisition of Telford Homes plc in 2019 (the Telford acquisition) (purchase accounting) that were sold in the period, costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring, costs associated with workforce optimization, transformation initiatives, and integration and other costs related to acquisitions. The above definition was changed in fourth quarter 2021 to include non-controlling interest given the acquisition of Turner & Townsend. Prior period results have been recast to conform to this definition.

(4)Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share (or adjusted EPS) exclude the effect of select items from GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per diluted share as well as adjust the provision for income taxes and impact on non-controlling interest for such charges. Adjustments during the periods presented included non-cash depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets attributable to acquisitions, certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, the impact of fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the Telford acquisition (purchase accounting) that were sold in the period, costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring, integration and other costs related to acquisitions, costs associated with workforce optimization, transformation initiatives and asset impairments.

(5)Core adjusted net income and core adjusted EPS removes from adjusted EPS the fair value changes and related tax impact of certain strategic non-core non-controlling equity investments that are not directly related to our business segments (including venture capital “VC” related investments). During the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2021, this measure also removed the impact of net gain recorded on deconsolidation of CBRE Acquisition Holdings, Inc. upon and with its merger into Altus Power, Inc.

(6)Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures (reflected in the investing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows).

(7)Segment operating profit is the measure reported to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to each segment and assessing performance of each segment. Segment operating profit represents earnings, inclusive of non-controlling interest, before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and asset impairments, as well as adjustments related to the following: certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, fair value adjustments to real estate acquired in the Telford acquisition (purchase accounting) that were sold in the period, costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring, costs associated with workforce optimization, transformation initiatives and integration and other costs related to acquisitions. The above definition was changed in fourth quarter 2021 to include non-controlling interest given the acquisition of Turner & Townsend. Prior period results have been recast to conform to this definition.

(8)Segment operating profit on revenue and net revenue margins represent segment operating profit divided by revenue and net revenue, respectively.

(9)Represents line of business profitability/losses, as adjusted.

(10)For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the company incurred capital expenditures of $88.4 million (reflected in the investing section of the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows) and received tenant concessions from landlords of $12.5 million (reflected in the operating section of the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows).

(11)Net debt (cash) is calculated as cash available for company use less total debt (excluding non-recourse debt).

(12)Cash represents cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and excludes $125.2 million of cash in consolidated funds and other entities not available for company use at December 31, 2021.

(13)Fourth-quarter 2021 GWS net revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately 4% due to a reclassification of pass-through revenue in project management. There was no impact to GWS revenue in the period.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following measures are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC guidelines:

(i)Net revenue

(ii)Net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders, as adjusted (which we also refer to as “adjusted net income”)

(iii)Diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders, as adjusted (which we also refer to as “adjusted earnings per diluted share” or “adjusted EPS”)

(iv)Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 

(v)Business line operating profit/loss

(vi)Segment operating profit on revenue and net revenue margins

(vii)Free cash flow

(viii)Net cash

(ix)Core adjusted net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders (which we also refer to as “core adjusted net income”)

(x)Core Adjusted EPS

These measures are not recognized measurements under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Our management generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. The company believes these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. The company further uses certain of these measures, and believes that they are useful to investors, for purposes described below.

With respect to net revenue, net revenue is gross revenue less costs largely associated with subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. We believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company’s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients that generally have no margin, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business. Prior to 2021, the company utilized fee revenue to analyze the overall financial performance. Fee revenue excluded additional reimbursed costs, primarily related to employees dedicated to clients, some of which included minimal margin.

With respect to adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, business line operating profit, and segment operating profit on revenue and net revenue margins, the company believes that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the accounting effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions—and in the case of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, business line operating profit and segment operating profit on revenue and net revenue margins—the effects of financings and income tax and the accounting effects of capital spending. All of these measures may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In the case of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, this measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use because it does not consider cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The consolidated

adjusted EBITDA measure calculated herein may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt. The company also uses consolidated adjusted EBITDA, segment operating profit, adjusted and core adjusted EPS as significant components when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.

With respect to free cash flow, the company believes that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the cash flow generated from operations after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and capital expenditures. With respect to net cash, the company believes that investors use this measure when calculating the company’s net leverage ratio. 

With respect to core adjusted EPS and core adjusted net income, the company believes that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the underlying performance of operations without the impact of strategic non-core equity investments (Altus Power Inc. and VC investments) and net gain recognized upon deconsolidation of the SPAC that are not directly related to our business segments. These can be volatile and are often non-cash in nature.
