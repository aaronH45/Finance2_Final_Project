 Item 1.01  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

Merger Agreement  

On February 22, 2022, TEGNA Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with Teton Parent Corp., a newly formed Delaware corporation (“Parent”), Teton Merger Corp., a newly formed Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and solely for purposes of certain provisions specified therein, other subsidiaries of Parent, certain affiliates of Standard General L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Standard General”) and CMG Media Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“CMG,”) and certain of its subsidiaries. Parent, Merger Sub, the other subsidiaries of Parent, those affiliates of Standard General, CMG and those subsidiaries of CMG, are collectively, referred to as the “Parent Restructuring Entities.” Capitalized terms used in this Current Report on Form 8-K but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto.  

The Merger Agreement provides, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger Agreement provides that each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the “Common Stock”) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) (other than (i) shares of Common Stock owned by Parent or owned or held in treasury by the Company, except for shares of Common Stock held on behalf of third parties; (ii) shares of Common Stock owned or held by any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, except for shares of Common Stock held on behalf of third parties; and (iii) shares of Common Stock held by holders of such shares who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, with respect to such shares) will at the Effective Time automatically be converted into the right to receive (i) $24.00 per share of Common Stock in cash, without interest plus (ii) (A) if the date on which the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) occurs (the “Closing Date”) after November 22, 2022 and before February 22, 2023, an amount in cash equal to (x) $0.00166667 multiplied by (y) the number of calendar days elapsed after November 22, 2022 to and including the Closing Date, (B) if the Closing Date occurs on or after February 22, 2023 and before March 22, 2023, an amount in cash equal to (x) $0.15333333 plus (y)(I) $0.0025 multiplied by (II) the number of calendar days elapsed after February 22, 2023 to and including the Closing Date, (C) if the Closing Date occurs on or after March 22, 2023 and before April 22, 2023, an amount in cash equal to (x) $0.22333333 plus (y)(I) $0.00333333 multiplied by (II) the number of calendar days elapsed after March 22, 2023 to and including the Closing Date, (D) if the Closing Date occurs on or after April 22, 2023 and before May 22, 2023, an amount in cash equal to (x) $0.3266667 plus (y)(I) $0.00416667 multiplied by (II) the number of calendar days elapsed after April 22, 2023 to and including the Closing Date, in each case without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).  

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each (i) time-based restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of Common Stock (a “Company RSU Award”) and (ii) performance-based restricted stock unit or performance share award in respect of shares of Common Stock (a “Company PSU Award”), in each case, whether vested or unvested, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less amounts that are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable law. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to a Company PSU Award will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable award agreement that apply in a “Change of Control” within the meaning of the applicable award agreement, with certain adjustments for Company PSU Awards granted in 2021. Any Company RSU Award or Company restricted stock award under the Company’s deferred compensation plan will be considered and treated as a Company RSU Award.  

The Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) has unanimously determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and resolved to recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.  

-2-   

The obligation of the parties to complete the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others:  

   •    

the approval of the Merger Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the “Company Stockholder Approval”);  

   •

   •    

the right of the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement (a) if (i) all conditions to the obligation of the Company to effect the Merger have been satisfied or validly waived, (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Closing by the date upon which the Closing should have occurred pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (iii) the Company provides irrevocable and unconditional notice to Parent at

The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, the Parent Restructuring Entities or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement as of the specific dates therein, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be reflected in the Company’s public disclosures. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the Company and the Parent Restructuring Entities and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that will be contained in or attached as an annex to the proxy statement that the Company will file in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as in the other filings that the Company will make with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Company acknowledges that, notwithstanding the inclusion of the foregoing cautionary statements, it is responsible for considering whether additional specific disclosures of material information regarding material contractual provisions are required to make the statements in this Form 8-K not misleading.

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Parent Restructuring Entities entered into the Contribution Agreement pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Parent Restructuring Entities will consummate the Restructuring. The Company is not a party to the Contribution Agreement, but has certain third-party beneficiary rights relating to its ability to specifically enforce the regulatory efforts covenants and certain other provisions set forth therein. The parties to the Contribution Agreement may not amend, waive, or terminate the Contribution Agreement if such action would prevent, materially impede, or materially delay the consummation of the Restructuring or the Merger or if such action relates to the termination or conditions to closing provisions of the Contribution Agreement.
