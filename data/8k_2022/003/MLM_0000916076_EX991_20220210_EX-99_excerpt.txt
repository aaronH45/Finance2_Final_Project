Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated, “By nearly all measures, 2021 was a momentous period of growth for Martin Marietta. We made tremendous progress on our SOAR 2025 initiatives and delivered the most profitable and safest year in our Company’s history. Notably, 2021 marked ten years of consecutive growth for consolidated products and services revenues, adjusted gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share. We also successfully completed $3.1 billion in value-enhancing acquisitions, thereby expanding our geographic footprint and product offerings in multiple attractive high-growth markets. These accomplishments are a testament to our team’s commitment to Martin Marietta’s vision and strategic priorities and further position our Company for continued success in 2022 and beyond.  

“As we look forward, Martin Marietta is poised to capitalize on the favorable demand trends and market fundamentals across our key geographies. Building on attractive fourth-quarter momentum, we anticipate that both public and private construction activity will accelerate for the first time since our industry’s product shipment peak in 2005. Enhanced federal- and state-level surface transportation investment, single-family housing strength, and notable heavy industrial projects should drive robust product demand in 2022. These trends, combined with a light nonresidential recovery and incremental federal funding from the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, further support growing construction activity. Importantly, Martin Marietta has the ability and capacity to supply these needed products and, supported by our locally-led pricing strategy, will do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume.” 

Mr. Nye concluded, “We are confident in our ability to benefit from these favorable macroeconomic trends as Martin Marietta builds the safest, best performing and most durable aggregates-led public company. With a steadfast commitment to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and execution of our strategic plan, we are confident in Martin Marietta’s opportunities to continue to deliver industry-leading safety, operational and financial performance. As we SOAR to a Sustainable Future, we look forward to extending our long track record of disciplined growth and enhancing stakeholder value.”

Fourth-Quarter Operating and Financial Results 

(All operating and financial results are for continuing operations and comparisons are versus the prior-year fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted) 

Building Materials Business 

The Building Materials business achieved record fourth-quarter products and services revenues of $1.3 billion, a 26.9 percent increase, and record product gross profit of $318.4 million, a 6.6 percent increase. The business experienced strong shipment levels across all product lines and primary end-use markets, aided, in part, by weather conditions that extended 2021 construction activity. Pricing also increased across all product lines.  

As previously announced, on October 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Lehigh Hanson, Inc.’s West Region business (“Lehigh West Region”), which included a portfolio of 17 active aggregates quarries, two cement plants with related distribution terminals, and targeted downstream operations, predominantly in California and Arizona. Lehigh West Region’s aggregates, asphalt and Arizona ready mixed concrete businesses are reported within the Company’s West Group. The remainder of the Lehigh West Region’s operations, namely the cement and California ready mixed concrete businesses, are classified as assets held for sale/discontinued operations. The Company is actively exploring strategic alternatives for these businesses.  

Aggregates  

Fourth-quarter organic aggregates shipments increased 9.3 percent, reflecting growing product demand that overcame continued contractor and transportation-related capacity constraints. Organic pricing increased 2.8 percent, in line with management’s previously stated expectations.  

Total aggregates shipments, including acquired operations, grew 19.7 percent. Acquired operations have selling prices below the Company’s average, which limited overall pricing growth to 1.4 percent.  

By segment: 

♦  

East Group total shipments increased 13.8 percent and benefitted from robust construction activity across all three primary end-use markets and volume from the acquired Minnesota-based Tiller operations. Pricing, inclusive of acquisitions, decreased slightly. On a mix-adjusted basis, East Group pricing grew 2.7 percent. 

♦  

West Group total shipments increased 30.5 percent from strong underlying demand in both Texas and Colorado and shipments from newly-acquired operations. Pricing increased 6.1 percent, or 2.6 percent on a mix-adjusted basis, driven by improving long-haul shipments from higher-priced distribution yards. 

Fourth-quarter aggregates product gross margin decreased 450 basis points to 26.2 percent, driven primarily by $15.3 million in higher diesel costs and a $13.4 million increase in cost of revenues from the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding the impact of acquisition accounting, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 27.9 percent. 

- MORE - 

Cement 

Texas cement shipments increased 0.3 percent to nearly 1.1 million tons, a quarterly record. Large and diversified projects, coupled with improving demand for specialty oil-well cement products, offset one less shipping day relative to the prior-year quarter. Pricing grew 11.6 percent, or 9.9 percent on a mix-adjusted basis, reflecting favorable Texas market dynamics. Cement product gross margin declined 350 basis points to 41.0 percent as higher energy and raw materials costs outpaced shipment and pricing gains. 

Downstream businesses 

Organic ready mixed concrete shipments increased 8.3 percent, reflecting the healthy Texas and Colorado demand environment. Organic pricing grew 3.3 percent, supported by mid-year price increases in Texas. Inclusive of the acquired Arizona operations, ready mixed concrete shipments and pricing increased 18.9 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively. Product gross margin declined 70 basis points to 8.0 percent, driven by higher raw material and diesel costs. 

Favorable winter weather conditions in Colorado contributed to a 15.8 percent increase in organic asphalt shipments. Organic pricing increased 7.1 percent. Including the acquired Tiller and Lehigh West Region operations, total asphalt shipments and pricing increased 211.5 percent and 9.0 percent, respectively. Asphalt and paving products and services gross margin decreased 650 basis points to 11.6 percent, driven by higher raw material costs and a $1.5 million increase in cost of revenues from the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding the impact of acquisition accounting, adjusted products and services gross margin was 12.5 percent. 

Magnesia Specialties Business 

Magnesia Specialties fourth-quarter product revenues increased 18.8 percent to a record $67.6 million, reflecting robust domestic and global demand. Product gross margin declined 440 basis points to 38.4 percent as higher energy, raw material and contract services costs offset revenue growth.  

Consolidated 

Fourth-quarter other nonoperating expenses, net, included $7.4 million in 2021 and $5.9 million in 2020 to finance third-party railroad maintenance. In exchange, the Company received a federal income tax benefit of $9.2 million and $7.3 million, respectively.

Cash Generation, Capital Allocation and Liquidity 

Cash provided by operating activities was $1.14 billion in 2021, an all-time record, compared with $1.05 billion in 2020. 

Cash paid for property, plant and equipment additions was $423.1 million. 

On October 1, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Lehigh West Region for $2.3 billion in cash. The acquisition was primarily financed using proceeds from the July 2021 issuance of publicly traded debt. 

The Company returned $147.8 million to shareholders through dividend payments in 2021. Since announcing a 20 million share repurchase authorization in February 2015, the Company has returned over $1.9 billion through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  

The Company had $258.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand and nearly $1.2 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2021.  

Full-Year 2022 Guidance 

Martin Marietta remains confident that favorable pricing dynamics will continue, supported by the Company’s locally-driven pricing strategy, and attractive underlying fundamentals and long-term secular growth trends in its key geographies should drive multi-year growth in construction materials.  

Full-year guidance excludes the businesses classified as discontinued operations.

Fourth-quarter results and trends described in this release may not necessarily be indicative of the Company’s future performance. The Company’s outlook is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and is based on assumptions that the Company believes in good faith are reasonable but which may be materially different from actual results. Factors that the Company currently believes could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this release (including the outlook) include, but are not limited to: the ability of the Company to face challenges, including those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of any such related response plans; the fluctuations in COVID-19 cases in the United States and the extent that geography of outbreak primarily matches the regions in which the Company’s Building Materials business principally operates; the resiliency and potential declines of the Company’s various construction end-use markets; the potential negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s ability to continue supplying heavy-side building materials and related services at normal levels or at all in the Company’s key regions; the duration, impact and severity of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, including the markets in which it does business, its suppliers, customers or other business partners as well as on its employees; the economic impact of government responses to the pandemic; the performance of the United States economy, including the impact on the economy of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental orders restricting activities imposed to prevent further outbreak of COVID-19; shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the Company’s control; a widespread decline in aggregates pricing, including a decline in aggregates shipment volume negatively affecting aggregates price; the history of both cement and ready mixed concrete being subject to significant changes in supply, demand and price fluctuations; the termination, capping and/or reduction or suspension of the federal and/or state gasoline tax(es) or other revenue related to public construction; the level and timing of federal, state or local transportation or infrastructure or public projects funding, most particularly in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota and Maryland; the impact of governmental orders restricting activities imposed to prevent further outbreak of COVID-19 on travel, potentially reducing state fuel tax revenues used to fund highway projects; the United States Congress’ inability to reach agreement among themselves or with the Administration on policy issues that impact the federal budget; the ability of states and/or other entities to finance approved projects either with tax revenues or alternative financing structures; levels of construction spending in the markets the Company serves; a reduction in defense spending and the subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases; a decline in the commercial component of the nonresidential construction market, notably office and retail space, including a decline resulting from economic distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic; a decline in energy-related construction activity resulting from a sustained period of low global oil prices or changes in oil production patterns or capital spending, particularly in Texas and West Virginia; increasing residential mortgage interest rates and other factors that could result in a slowdown in residential construction; unfavorable weather conditions, particularly Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico hurricane activity, the late start to spring or the early onset of winter and the impact of a drought or excessive rainfall in the markets served by the Company, any of which can significantly affect production schedules, volumes, product and/or geographic mix and profitability; whether the Company’s operations will continue to be treated as “essential” operations under applicable government orders restricting business activities imposed to prevent further outbreak of COVID-19 or, even if so treated, whether site-specific health and safety concerns might otherwise require certain of the Company’s operations to be halted for some period of time; the volatility of fuel costs, particularly diesel fuel, and the impact on the cost, or the availability generally, of other consumables, namely steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts, and with respect to the Company’s Magnesia Specialties business, natural gas; continued increases in the cost of other repair and supply parts; construction labor shortages and/or supply‐chain challenges; unexpected equipment failures, unscheduled maintenance, industrial accident or other prolonged and/or significant disruption to production facilities; increasing governmental regulation, including environmental laws; the failure of relevant government agencies to implement expected regulatory reductions; transportation availability or a sustained reduction in capital investment by the railroads, notably the availability of railcars, locomotive power and the condition of rail infrastructure to move trains to supply the Company’s Texas, Colorado, Florida, Carolinas and Gulf Coast markets, including the movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan and its customers; increased transportation costs, including increases from higher or fluctuating passed-through energy costs or fuel surcharges, and other costs to comply with tightening regulations, as well as higher volumes of rail and water shipments; availability of trucks and licensed drivers for transport of the Company’s materials; availability and cost of construction equipment in the United States; weakening in the steel industry markets served by the Company’s dolomitic lime products; trade disputes with one or more nations impacting the U.S. economy, including the impact of tariffs on the steel industry; unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers that introduce volatility to earnings, including that of the Magnesia Specialties business that is running at capacity; proper functioning of information technology and automated operating systems to manage or support operations; inflation and its effect on both production and interest costs; the concentration of customers in construction markets and the increased risk of potential losses on customer receivables; the impact of the level of demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and management of production costs on the operating leverage and therefore profitability of the Company; the possibility that the expected synergies from acquisitions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period, including achieving anticipated profitability to maintain compliance with the Company’s leverage ratio debt covenant; changes in tax laws, the interpretation of such laws and/or administrative practices, including acquisitions or divestitures, that would increase the Company’s tax rate; violation of the Company’s debt covenant if price and/or volumes return to previous levels of instability; downward pressure on the Company’s common stock price and its impact on goodwill impairment evaluations; the possibility of a reduction of the Company’s credit rating to non-investment grade; and other risk factors listed from time to time found in the Company’s filings with the SEC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Earnings from continuing operations before interest; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; the earnings/loss from nonconsolidated equity affiliates; acquisition-related expenses; and the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting (Adjusted EBITDA) is an indicator used by the Company and investors to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles and, as such, should not be construed as an alternative to earnings from operations, net earnings or operating cash flow. For further information on Adjusted EBITDA, refer to the Company’s website at www.martinmarietta.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Continued) 

Mix-adjusted average selling price (mix-adjusted ASP) is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of period-over-period product, geographic and other mix on the average selling price. Mix-adjusted ASP is calculated by comparing current-period shipments to like-for-like shipments in the comparable prior period. Management uses this metric to evaluate the realization of pricing increases and believes this information is useful to investors. The following reconciles reported average selling price to mix-adjusted ASP and corresponding variances.
