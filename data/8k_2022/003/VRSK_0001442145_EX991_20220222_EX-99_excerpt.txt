  •   We paid a cash dividend of 29 cents per share on December 31, 2021. Our Board of Directors has approved an increase in our cash dividend to 31 cents per share payable on March 31, 2022.    

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

JERSEY CITY, N.J., February 22, 2022 — Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK), a leading global data analytics provider, today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. 

Scott Stephenson, chairman, president, and CEO, said, “Verisk is at an exciting juncture in our Company’s history, as our investments in innovation, technological transformation, and international expansion are delivering results. Importantly, we have several value-enhancing operational and governance initiatives underway that will support this momentum, including, among other things, the divestitures of Verisk Financial Services and 3E, as part of our ongoing comprehensive portfolio review. It has been my honor to lead Verisk and help position the company for sustainable growth and success, and I have the utmost confidence in our team’s ability to continue this progress after my retirement.” 

Lee Shavel, CFO and group president, said, “Verisk’s demonstrated margin expansion and strong leverage reflects our continued efforts to drive durable, long-term growth and returns for shareholders. We are pleased to be instituting a significant share repurchase program later this year, which is the result of our refocused capital allocation priorities, ongoing cost-reduction initiatives and the expected proceeds from pending divestitures. As I prepare to step into the role of CEO, I look forward to advancing the transformational work of our incredible team to enhance shareholder value and help our customers make better decisions about risk, investments, and operations.”

1   

Revenues 

Consolidated revenues increased 7.4%, and 5.2% on an OCC basis, for fourth-quarter 2021. In late March 2020, we analyzed our solutions and services to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our revenue streams. We did not identify any material impact stemming from COVID-19 on approximately 85% of our revenues as much of these revenues are subscription-based and subject to long-term contracts. These revenues increased 6.2% on an OCC basis in the fourth quarter of 2021. Of the remaining 15%, we have identified specific solutions and services, largely transactional in nature, that have been impacted by COVID-19. These revenues decreased 1.1% on an OCC basis in fourth-quarter 2021 as compared to the prior-year period. 

Revenues and Revenue Growth by Segment 

(in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Insurance segment revenues grew 9.0% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 6.4% on an OCC basis.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Energy and Specialized Markets segment revenue increased 3.9% in the quarter and 2.8% on an OCC basis. Growth was primarily driven by our core research solutions and environmental health and safety service revenues. 

Financial Services segment revenue increased 0.1% in the quarter and 0.1% on an OCC basis, primarily due to growth in our spend informed analytics revenues. This growth was partially offset by projects that did not reoccur and lower bankruptcy volumes. 

2   

Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA 

During fourth-quarter 2021, net income attributable to Verisk decreased 19.5%. The decrease was primarily related to a non-cash impairment charge of $134.0 million associated with our Financial Services reporting unit, partially offset by the release of a previously established litigation reserve upon final settlement in the fourth-quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.0%, and 7.6% on an OCC basis reflecting core operating leverage on solid revenue growth and cost efficiencies, driving margin expansion.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Earnings Per Share and Diluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share 

Diluted EPS attributable to Verisk decreased 18.7% to $0.87 for the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily due to an impairment of long-lived assets associated with our Financial Services segment, partially offset by the release of a litigation reserve related to our remote imagery business. 

Diluted adjusted EPS grew 15.7% to $1.47 for the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily due to organic growth within the business, lower interest expense, lower effective tax rate, and a lower average share count.  

Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $188.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, down 24.2%. Capital expenditures were $85.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, up 17.8%. Free cash flow was $103.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, down 41.5% primarily due to a payment to settle the litigation associated with our remote imagery business. See "Non-GAAP reconciliations" below for a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure. 

Dividend 

On December 31, 2021, we paid a cash dividend of 29 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding to the holders of record as of December 15, 2021. 

On February 16, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a 6.9% increase in our cash dividend to 31 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding, payable on March 31, 2022, to holders of record as of March 15, 2022.  

Share Repurchases 

Including the accelerated share repurchase (ASR) settled in the fourth quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately 352 thousand shares at an average price of $212.82 per share, for a total cost of $75.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. On December 31, 2021, we had $603.8 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. On February 16, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an additional authorization of $1.0 billion.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This release contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. This includes, but is not limited to, our expectation and ability to pay a cash dividend on our common stock in the future, subject to the determination by our Board of Directors and based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation determinations, and other factors, risks, and uncertainties. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. 

Other factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this release reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Notes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

We have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management. 

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses: EBITDA represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense; and (iv) provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss. Adjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparison. 

Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS: Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items. 

Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions. 

Organic: Organic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale) that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP). Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent dispositions, for which results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability. 

Organic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate: Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar; accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial information to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the currency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.

See page 11 for a reconciliation of segment adjusted EBITDA margin, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA expenses, and a reconciliation of diluted adjusted EPS. See page 12 for a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.
