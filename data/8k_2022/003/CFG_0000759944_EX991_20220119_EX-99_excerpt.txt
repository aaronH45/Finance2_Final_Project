Comments from Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun

“We finished a successful 2021 with a strong fourth quarter, featuring record Capital Markets revenue, strong loan growth, good expense management and pristine credit,” said Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun. “Over the course of 2021 we continued to raise our game in terms of delivering for our stakeholders - customers, colleagues, communities and shareholders. I’d like to thank our colleague base for once again rising to the occasion and handling the many challenges presented by the environment. Continued successful execution of our strategic initiatives and acquisition integration will position us for superior growth in 2022 and beyond.”

Discussion of results:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth quarter 2021vs.third quarter 2021

Net interest income of $1.1 billion decreased 2% given modestly lower net interest margin, partially offset by loan growth. 

•Net interest margin of 2.66% decreased 6 basis points reflecting lower earning-asset yields and a reduced benefit from PPP forgiveness. These were partially offset by the deployment of cash into loan growth, which happened relatively late in the quarter. Interest-bearing deposit costs were down 1 basis point to 13 basis points.

Fourth quarter 2021vs.fourth quarter 2020

Net interest income of $1.1 billion was stable reflecting 3% growth in interest-earning assets, largely offset by lower net interest margin.

•Net interest margin of 2.66% decreased 9 basis points reflecting the impact of lower asset yields, partially offset by improved funding mix and deposit pricing, as well as higher PPP benefit. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 14 basis points to 13 basis points.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth quarter 2021vs.third quarter 2021

Noninterest income of $594 million increased $80 million, or 16%, from $514 million. Fourth quarter 2021 includes $29 million of fees from acquisitions that closed in third and fourth quarter 2021.

•Record capital markets fees increased $112 million reflecting higher M&A advisory and loan syndication fees; fourth quarter includes $27 million of fees from acquisitions.

•Mortgage banking fees decreased $32 million, reflecting a decline in gain-on-sale margins and seasonally lower production volume, partially offset by improved mortgage servicing income.

•Service charges and fees decreased $10 million, primarily reflecting the impact on overdraft fees of the new customer-friendly deposit account feature, Citizens Peace of MindTM.

•Other income increased $6 million, primarily reflecting higher leasing income.

Fourth quarter 2021vs.fourth quarter 2020

Noninterest income of $594 million increased $16 million, or 3%, as record results in Capital Markets and improvements in card fees and wealth fees were partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking fees. Fourth quarter 2021 includes $29 million of fees from acquisitions that closed in third and fourth quarter 2021. 

•Mortgage banking fees decreased $117 million, driven by lower gain-on-sale margins and production volumes.

•Record capital markets fees increased $96 million, driven by higher M&A advisory and loan syndication fees; fourth quarter 2021 includes $27 million of fees from acquisitions.

•Card fees increased $9 million, driven by higher debit and credit card volumes given economic recovery.

•Trust and investment services fees increased $8 million, reflecting an increase in assets under management from higher equity market levels and strong net inflows.

Fourth quarter 2021vs.third quarter 2021

Noninterest expense was $1.1 billion, up 5%, or 2% on an Underlying basis. Excluding acquisitions that closed in third and fourth quarter 2021, Underlying noninterest expense of $989 million was broadly stable, and operating leverage in the quarter was 1.8%. The impact of higher incentive compensation tied to strong Capital Markets revenue and continued strategic investments was offset by strong expense discipline and the benefit of efficiency initiatives.

The effective tax rate of 22.4% was stable. On an Underlying basis, the effective tax rate of 22.6% compares with 22.5% for third quarter 2021.

Fourth quarter 2021vs.fourth quarter 2020

Noninterest expense of $1.1 billion remains well-controlled. On an Underlying basis and excluding acquisitions that closed in third and fourth quarter 2021, noninterest expense of $989 million increased by $19 million, or 2%. This reflects higher salaries and employee benefits given revenue-based compensation and merit increases, as well as higher outside services tied to growth initiatives, partially offset by the benefit of efficiency initiatives.

The effective tax rate of 22.4% increased from 20.2%. On an Underlying basis, the effective tax rate of 22.6% increased from 21.7%. This primarily reflects higher pre-tax income and the benefit of discrete items recognized in fourth quarter 2020.

Loan growth of 4% was driven by a $5.5 billion increase in retail given strength in mortgage and auto, partially offset by planned run off of personal unsecured installment loans.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as Underlying results and excluding acquisitions. Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which Management does not consider indicative of the Company’s on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by our Management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results. The Appendix presents reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The following tables present reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements

This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements regarding potential future share repurchases and future dividends as well as the potential effects of the COVID-19 disruption on our business, operations, financial performance and prospects, are forward-looking statements. Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “targets,” “initiatives,” “potentially,” “probably,” “projects,” “outlook,” “guidance” or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and “could.”

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: 

•Negative economic and political conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of nonaccrual assets, charge-offs and provision expense; 

•The rate of growth in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions, and changes in the competitive environment; 

•Our ability to implement our business strategy, including the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our financial performance goals, including through the integration of Investors; 

•The COVID-19 disruption and its effects on the economic and business environments in which we operate;

•Our ability to meet heightened supervisory requirements and expectations; 

•Liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations; 

•Our capital and liquidity requirements under regulatory capital standards and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; 

•The effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; 

•Changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets; 

•The effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin; 

•Financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses; 

•A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks; 

•An inability to complete the Investors acquisition, or changes in the current anticipated timeframe, terms or manner of the acquisition;

•Greater than expected costs or other difficulties related to the integration of our business and that of Investors;

•The inability to retain existing Investors clients and employees following the closing of the Investors acquisition; 

•The occurrence of any event change or other circumstance that could give rise to the right of one or both parties to terminate the agreement to acquire Investors; and

•Management’s ability to identify and manage these and other risks. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the actual amounts and timing of any future common stock dividends or share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, risk-weighted assets, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory and accounting considerations, as well as any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares from or pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such repurchases or dividends. Further, statements about the effects of the COVID-19 disruption on our business, operations, financial performance and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual 

22

Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

impacts may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, third parties and us. Statements about Citizens’ agreement and plan of merger, dated July 28, 2021 (the “Investors acquisition agreement”), with Investors Bancorp, Inc. (“Investors”) and CBNA's agreement, dated May 26, 2021 (“HSBC branch acquisition agreement”) with HSBC Bank U.S.A., N.A. (“HSBC”) to acquire certain branches from HSBC also constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that actual results could be materially different from those expressed in those statements, including if either or both transactions are not consummated in a timely manner or at all, or if integration is more costly or difficult than expected.

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under “Risk Factors” in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
