NEW YORK, January 26, 2022 — Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) today reported net income of $265 million, or $0.85 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with a net loss of $97 million, or $0.32 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, the Corporation reported a net loss in the prior-year quarter of $176 million, or $0.58 per share. The improvement in adjusted

after-tax results compared with the prior-year period was primarily due to higher realized selling prices in the fourth quarter of 2021.

“This year marks an inflection point in the execution of our strategy,” CEO John Hess said. “We have built a differentiated portfolio offering a unique value proposition – delivering durable cash flow growth that enables us to continue to invest in some of the highest return projects in the industry and to start growing our cash returns to our shareholders.”

After-tax income (loss) by major operating activity was as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Exploration and Production:

E&P net income was $309 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with a net loss of $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, E&P's net loss in the prior-year quarter was $118 million. The Corporation’s average realized crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $71.04 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $45.32 per barrel in the prior-year quarter. The average realized natural gas liquids (NGL) selling price in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $36.47 per barrel, compared with $15.80 per barrel in the prior-year quarter, while the average realized natural gas selling price was $4.77 per mcf, compared with $3.35 per mcf in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Net production, excluding Libya, was 295,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 309,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2020, or 295,000 boepd proforma for assets sold. Net production for Libya was 21,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with 12,000 boepd in the prior-year quarter.

Cash operating costs, which include operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes, and E&P general and administrative expenses, were $12.17 per boe (excluding Libya: $12.84 per boe) in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $11.31 per boe (excluding Libya: $11.57 per boe) in the prior-year quarter. The change in per unit cost reflects the impact of lower production volumes and higher production and severance taxes in North Dakota in the fourth quarter of this year. Income tax expense increased in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with the prior-year quarter primarily due to improved results from Libya and Guyana.

Oil and Gas Reserves Estimates:

Oil and gas proved reserves at December 31, 2021, which are subject to final review, were 1,309 million boe, compared with 1,170 million boe at December 31, 2020. Net proved reserve additions in 2021 totaled 348 million boe, which is comprised of net positive revisions of 107 million boe due to higher commodity prices and other net additions of 241 million boe primarily from the Bakken. Asset sales in 2021 reduced proved reserves by 91 million boe.

Excluding asset sales, the Corporation replaced 295 percent of its 2021 production (204 percent excluding price revisions) at a finding and development cost of approximately $5.25 per boe (approximately $7.60 per boe excluding price revisions).

Operational Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of 2021:

Bakken (Onshore U.S.): Net production from the Bakken was 159,000 boepd compared with 189,000 boepd in the prior-year quarter primarily due to the impact of lower drilling activity caused by a reduction in rig count from six to one during the first half of last year, lower NGL and natural gas volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts, and the second quarter 2021 sale of Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interests, which contributed net production of approximately 5,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net oil production was 79,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) compared with 97,000 bopd in the fourth quarter of 2020. NGL and natural gas volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts were 9,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with 21,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to higher realized NGL prices lowering volumes received as consideration for gas processing fees. The Corporation added a second rig in February 2021 and a third rig in September 2021, and drilled 17 wells, completed 13 wells, and brought 19 new wells online in the fourth quarter.

3

Gulf of Mexico (Offshore U.S.): Net production from the Gulf of Mexico was 39,000 boepd, compared with 32,000 boepd in the prior-year quarter primarily due to downtime for hurricane-related maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net production from the Shenzi Field, which was sold in November 2020, was 3,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Guyana (Offshore): At the Stabroek Block (Hess – 30%), the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, announced two significant discoveries at Fangtooth and Lau Lau. The Fangtooth-1 well encountered approximately 164 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs, and confirms the deeper exploration potential of the Stabroek Block. The well was drilled in 6,030 feet of water and is located approximately 11 miles northwest of the Liza Field. The Lau Lau-1 well encountered approximately 315 feet of high quality hydrocarbon bearing sandstone reservoirs. The well was drilled in 4,793 feet of water and is located approximately 42 miles southeast of the Liza Field.

The Corporation’s net production from the Liza Destiny floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) was 31,000 bopd in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with 26,000 bopd in the prior-year quarter. On October 25, 2021, the Liza Unity FPSO, with an expected capacity of 220,000 gross bopd, arrived at the Stabroek Block and startup of Phase 2 of the Liza Field development remains on track for the first quarter of 2022. The third development, Payara, will utilize the Prosperity FPSO with an expected capacity of 220,000 gross bopd; first oil is expected in 2024. A fourth development, Yellowtail, was submitted to the government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter. Pending government approval and project sanctioning, the project is expected to have a capacity of 250,000 gross bopd with first oil anticipated in 2025. We expect to have at least six FPSOs on the Stabroek Block in 2027, with the potential for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base.

Following the completion of the Fangtooth-1 well, the Stena DrillMAX will begin drilling at the Tarpon prospect. Following the completion of the Lau Lau-1 well, the Noble Don Taylor began drilling at the Barreleye prospect. The Stena Carron completed drill stem tests on the Longtail-2, Whiptail-2 and Turbot-2 wells, and is currently performing a drill stem test on the Tilapia-1 well. The Noble Sam Croft, the Noble Bob Douglas and the Noble Tom Madden are currently drilling and completing development wells at Liza Phase 2 and the Payara Field.

South East Asia (Offshore): Net production at North Malay Basin and JDA was 66,000 boepd compared with 56,000 boepd in the prior-year quarter, reflecting higher natural gas nominations due to a recovery in economic activity which had been impacted by COVID-19.

Midstream:

The Midstream segment had net income of $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with net income of $62 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased revenue from higher minimum volume commitments and rates.

In October 2021, Hess Midstream LP completed a public offering of approximately 8.6 million Class A shares held by Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners. The Corporation received net proceeds of $108 million. After giving effect to this transaction, the Corporation owns an approximate 44% interest in Hess Midstream LP, on a consolidated basis.

Corporate, Interest and Other:

After-tax expense for Corporate, Interest and Other was $118 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Capital and Exploratory Expenditures:

E&P capital and exploratory expenditures were $593 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $371 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher drilling and development activity in Guyana and the Bakken. Midstream capital expenditures were $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $51 million in the prior-year quarter.

Liquidity:

Excluding the Midstream segment, Hess Corporation had cash and cash equivalents of $2.71 billion and debt and finance lease obligations totaling $6.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The Midstream segment had cash and cash equivalents of $2 million and total debt of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio as defined in its debt covenants was 42.3% at December 31, 2021 and 47.5% at December 31, 2020.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $899 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, up from $486 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities2 was $886 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $532 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher realized selling prices. Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash flow from operating activities by $13 million during the fourth quarter of 2021 and decreased cash flow from operating activities by $46 million in the prior-year quarter.

2.“Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities” is a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of this non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to its nearest GAAP equivalent measure appears on pages 7 and 8.

During the quarter, the Corporation received net proceeds of $108 million from the public offering of approximately 4.3 million Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream LP. In January 2022, the Corporation paid accrued Libyan income tax and royalties of approximately $470 million related to operations for the period December 2020 through November 2021.
