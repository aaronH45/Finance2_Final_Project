BALANCE SHEET AND OTHER INFORMATION

(millions - except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Based on guidance issued in early February 2022 from the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services, our December 2021 balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect a $541.5 million increase in both our other assets and our other liabilities. The equal and offsetting increases in the asset and liability accounts relate to a refund that we will receive from the surplus of the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA) and are required to pass through to the applicable Michigan policyholders. This transaction has no effect on our liquidity, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.

2 As of January 31, 2022, we held certain hybrid securities and recognized a change in fair value of $4.9 million as a realized loss during the period we held these securities.

3 At January 31, 2022, we had $855.8 million of net unsettled security transactions classified in “other liabilities.”

Monthly Commentary

•In January, we experienced unfavorable prior accident year development of 4.1 points. Our personal auto products incurred about 80% of the unfavorable development, primarily reflecting the continued increase in the cost to repair vehicles and higher severity in our physical damage, collision, and comprehensive coverages.

In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when we establish reserves for one or more contingencies. Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results, therefore, may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
