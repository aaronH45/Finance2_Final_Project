ATLANTA – Feb 01, 2022 - PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. For the quarter, the Company reported net income of $663 million, or $2.61 per share. Adjusted net income for the period was $637 million, or $2.51 per share, after excluding a $23 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves and a tax benefit of $9 million from deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period. Prior year fourth quarter reported net income was $438 million, or $1.62 per share. Adjusted net income for the prior year period was $415 million, or $1.53 per share, after excluding a $16 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves, a $22 million pre-tax charge from adjustments to Financial Services reserves, and a tax benefit of $28 million resulting from energy tax credits and deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period. 

 “Gains in home closings, revenues, gross margin and overhead leverage helped drive a 64% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter,” said Ryan Marshall, PulteGroup President and CEO. “Our outstanding quarterly results complete a year in which we grew reported earnings per share by 43%, returned in excess of $1.0 billion to shareholders, paid down $726 million of bonds and generated a return on equity of 28%*.”

“Given the country’s resilient economy, outstanding job market, rising wages and an ongoing desire for home ownership, we anticipate the strong buyer demand we realized in 2021 to continue in the year ahead,” added Marshall. “Although ongoing supply chain disruptions continue to challenge our industry, we believe that our size, growing community count and an available inventory of new homes have us well positioned to grow our business in 2022 while continuing to deliver exceptional returns.”

Fourth Quarter Results

For the fourth quarter, home sale revenues increased 38% over the prior year to $4.2 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter reflect a 26% increase in closings to 8,611 homes, along with a 10% increase in average sales price to $490,000. 

Home sale gross margin for the fourth quarter was 26.8%, which is an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year and an increase of 30 basis points over the third quarter of 2021. 

The Company’s reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $344 million, or 8.2% of home sale revenues, includes the $23 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the period. Exclusive of this benefit, adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was $367 million, or 8.7% of home sale revenues. Prior year reported SG&A expense of $280 million, or 9.1% of home sale revenues, included a $16 million pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves. Exclusive of that benefit, adjusted SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $296 million, or 9.7% of home sale revenues. 

The Company’s fourth quarter net new orders totaled 6,769 homes, which is a decrease of 4% from the prior year. Lower orders in the quarter primarily reflect a 7% decrease in average community count for the period and Company actions to limit the rate of sales in many of its communities. The value of net new orders in the fourth quarter increased 16% over last year to $3.8 billion. Average community count for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 785 compared with 846 communities in the comparable prior year period.

The Company ended the fourth quarter with a unit backlog of 18,003 homes, which is an increase of 19% over the comparable prior year period. Backlog value increased 45% to $9.9 billion. 

The Company’s Financial Services operations reported pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of $55 million. Prior year reported pre-tax income of $43 million included a $22 million pre-tax charge relating to reserve adjustments recorded in the period. Pre-tax income for the most recent quarter reflects the benefit of higher mortgage originations resulting from growth in our homebuilding operations, offset by the impacts of a more competitive operating environment. Pulte Mortgage’s capture rate for the fourth quarter was 85%, down from 86% last year. 

During the quarter, the Company repurchased 5.6 million of its common shares for $283 million, or an average price of $50.11 per share. For the full year of 2021, the Company repurchased 17.7 million common shares, representing a 6% reduction in shares outstanding, for $897 million, or an average price of $50.80 per share. 

At year end, the Company had $1.8 billion of cash and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 21.3%, which is down from 29.5% at the end of 2020.  Adjusting for cash on hand, the Company’s net debt-to-total capital ratio at year end was 2.5%. 

 In a separate press release, PulteGroup announced that its Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion increase to the Company’s share repurchase authorization. “The consistent cash flow being generated by our operations is allowing us to increase investment in our business and return more funds to our shareholders,” said Bob O’Shaughnessy, PulteGroup Executive Vice President and CFO. “Today’s announcement of a $1 billion increase to our repurchase authorization reflects our belief in the ongoing earnings potential of the business. Given the strength of our operating model and resulting cash flow, we believe we can continue growing our business while now operating with a gross debt-to-capital ratio of between 20% to 30%, which is down from our previous target of 30% to 40%.”

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(Unaudited)

This report contains information about our operating results reflecting certain adjustments, including net income, diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), operating margin, and debt-to-capital ratio. These measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC's rules and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measures as measures of our profitability. We believe that reflecting these adjustments provides investors relevant and useful information for evaluating the comparability of financial information presented and comparing our profitability to other companies in the homebuilding industry. Although other companies in the homebuilding industry report similar information, the methods used may differ. We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate these measures and any adjustments thereto before comparing our measures to those of such other companies.

The following tables set forth a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures that management believes to be most directly comparable ($000's omitted):
