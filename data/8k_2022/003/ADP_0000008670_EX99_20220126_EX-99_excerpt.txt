ROSELAND, N.J. – January 26, 2022 – ADP (Nasdaq: ADP), a leading global technology company providing human capital management (HCM) solutions, today announced its second quarter fiscal 2022 financial results and updated its fiscal 2022 outlook.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Consolidated Results

Compared to last year’s second quarter, revenues increased 9% to $4.0 billion and 9% on an organic constant currency basis. Net earnings increased 7% to $694 million, and adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $697 million. Adjusted EBIT increased 10% to $930 million, representing an adjusted EBIT margin increase of 20 basis points in the quarter to 23.1%, as higher operating revenues were partially offset by increased expenses related to implementation and service, as well as higher PEO pass-through expenses. ADP’s effective tax rate for the quarter on both a reported basis and an adjusted basis was 23.7%. Diluted EPS increased 9% to $1.65, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 9% to $1.65.

“We maintained our momentum in sales, client satisfaction, and client retention during the quarter, reflecting the compelling value proposition ADP continues to provide to our clients during these challenging times," said Carlos Rodriguez, Chief Executive Officer, ADP. "As we shared at our recent Investor Day, we see significant opportunity to serve as a partner to employers across the globe, and we remain steadfast in our focus on the years ahead as we advance our products, invest in distribution, and work to make HR simpler for our large and growing base of clients."

"Our revenue performance once again exceeded our expectations with particularly strong PEO results, and we were pleased to drive a slight margin increase even as we invested in our service and implementation organizations as we build a strong foundation for sustained future growth," said Don McGuire, Chief Financial Officer, ADP.
