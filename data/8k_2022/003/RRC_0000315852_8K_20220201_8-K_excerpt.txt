 ITEM 1.01  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement  

Private Placement  

On February 1, 2022, Range Resources Corporation (the “Company”) completed a private offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2030 (the “Notes”), which are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company’s existing subsidiaries (collectively, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”).  

The Notes were offered by the Initial Purchasers (as defined below) pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand and borrowings under its bank credit facility, to redeem all of its outstanding 9.250% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”).  

Indenture  

The terms of the Notes are governed by the Indenture, dated as of February 1, 2022 (the “Indenture”), by and among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes will mature on February 15, 2030. Interest will accrue from February 1, 2022 and will be payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2022.  

The Notes are unsecured, rank equally with all of the existing and future senior unsecured debt of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors and rank senior to all of the existing and future subordinated debt of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Notes will rank effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, including under the Company’s bank credit facility, and other secured obligations to the extent of the value of the assets constituting collateral securing such indebtedness and obligations.  

The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or after February 15, 2025 at the redemption prices specified in the Indenture. Prior to such time, the Company may, at its option, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 104.75% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, using all or a portion of the net proceeds of public sales of certain equity interests. In addition, before February 15, 2025, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 104.750% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the “applicable premium” and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.  

Upon the occurrence of certain changes in control, the Company must offer to repurchase the Notes. The Indenture contains customary events of default (each an “Event of Default”). If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on, all the Notes then outstanding to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, all the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders of the Notes. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences.  

The above description of the Indenture, the Notes and the guarantees is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
