The following information is provided to aid in understanding Mastercard’s fourth quarter 2021 results, versus the year ago period:

•Net revenue increased 27%, or 28% on a currency-neutral basis, which includes a 3 percentage point benefit from acquisitions. The increase was driven by the impact of the following factors: 

•Gross dollar volume growth of 23%, on a local currency basis, to $2.1 trillion.

•Cross-border volume growth of 53% on a local currency basis.

•Switched transactions growth of 27%.

•Other revenues increased 28%, or 30% on a currency-neutral basis, which includes 9 percentage points of growth due to acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by the company’s Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions.

•These increases to net revenue were partially offset by:

◦Rebates and incentives growth of 37%, or 38% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting the higher growth in volume and transactions and new and renewed deals.

•Total operating expenses increased 16%. Excluding the impact of Special Items, adjusted operating expenses increased 18%, or 19% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a 7 percentage point increase from acquisitions. The remaining increase was primarily due to increased spending on advertising and marketing, higher personnel costs to support the continued investment in our strategic initiatives and increased data processing costs.

•Other income (expense) was unfavorable $114 million, primarily due to lower net gains in the current period related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities. Adjusted other income (expense) was unfavorable $5 million versus the year ago period.

•The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 15.7%, versus 17.6% for the comparable period in 2020. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 14.7%, versus 17.5% for the comparable period in 2020, primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings for the company.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

Mastercard discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted other income (expense), adjusted effective income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (as well as related applicable growth rates versus the comparable period in the prior year). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on the company’s equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts. The company excludes these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items.

In addition, the company presents growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results as well as removing the related impact of the company’s foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different from the company’s U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. The impact of the related realized gains and losses resulting from the company’s foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments is recognized in the respective financial statement line item on the statement of operations when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings. The company believes the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to facilitate an understanding of its operating results. 

The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods. The company’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. 

The company includes reconciliations of the requisite non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Footnote

The tables set forth the gross dollar volume (“GDV”), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions and cards on a regional and global basis for Mastercard™-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.

Debit transactions on Maestro® and Cirrus®-branded cards and transactions involving brands other than Mastercard are not included in the preceding tables.

For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are Mastercard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them.

The Mastercard payment products are comprised of credit, charge, debit and prepaid programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving Mastercard-branded cards that are not switched by Mastercard and transactions for which Mastercard does not earn significant revenues.

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.

The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems. The data set forth in the cards columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by Mastercard. A portion of the data set forth in the cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s customers. 

Performance information for prior periods can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Mastercard website at investor.mastercard.com.
