EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY 

“In 2021, Zoetis delivered its strongest performance ever, thanks to our innovative, diverse and durable portfolio, and the talent and commitment of our colleagues,” said Kristin Peck, Chief Executive Officer of Zoetis. “We grew revenue 15% operationally, which is once again above the expected market growth rate in the $45 billion animal health market. We also grew our adjusted net income faster than revenue, at 19% operationally, while continuing to support investments in our latest product launches and future pipeline of innovations."

"Looking forward, we believe this momentum sets us up for a strong 2022. We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in the coming year, driven by continued strength in petcare; expansion of our diagnostics portfolio internationally; and significant growth in both livestock and companion animal product sales in emerging markets, including China and Brazil. As a result, we are guiding to full-year operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue," said Peck.

QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS 

Zoetis organizes and manages its commercial operations across two regional segments: the United States (U.S.) and International. Within these segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for companion animals and livestock tailored to local trends and customer needs. In the fourth quarter of 2021: 

•Revenue in the U.S. segment was $1.040 billion, an increase of 9% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Sales of companion animal products increased 20%, driven by growth across the company’s parasiticides portfolio, including Simparica Trio® for dogs. The key dermatology portfolio also significantly contributed to growth across both the Apoquel® and Cytopoint® brands. Sales of livestock products declined 13% in the quarter. Sales of

cattle products declined as a result of generic competition for Draxxin® and continued weakness in beef and dairy consumer markets. The company’s poultry portfolio declined due to the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix®, the company’s alternative to antibiotics in medicated feed additives. Sales of swine products declined due to pricing pressure on anti-infectives and vaccines.

•Revenue in the International segment was $902 million, an increase of 8% on a reported and operational basis compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Sales of companion animal products increased 22% on a reported basis and 23% operationally. Growth resulted from increased sales in the key dermatology portfolio across both the Apoquel and Cytopoint brands, as well as from the company’s recently launched monoclonal antibody (mAb) products for control of osteoarthritis pain, Librela® for dogs and Solensia® for cats. The parasiticides portfolio, including the Simparica®/Simparica Trio and Revolution®/Stronghold® franchises, also contributed to growth, as well as the broader in-line portfolio which benefited from increased pet ownership and standards of care. Sales of livestock products declined 1% on a reported basis and 2% operationally. Sales of cattle products declined due to generic competition for Draxxin. Sales of swine products decreased in the quarter as a result of declining pork prices due to increased supply in China. Growth in the company’s fish portfolio was primarily the result of increased sales of the Alpha Flux® sea lice treatment product and Alpha Ject LiVac® SRS vaccine. Growth in poultry was driven by market expansion and demand generation efforts in key geographies including the Middle East and China.

INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH

Zoetis continues to gain market approvals for its innovative mAb therapies. Since its last quarterly earnings announcement, the company received approval in the U.S. for Solensia (frunevetmab), the first injectable mAb for the control of pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA) in cats; it is also approved in the European Union (EU), the U.K., Canada and Switzerland. 

Additionally, the company introduced lifecycle innovations for key companion animal products from its dermatology and parasiticide portfolios. In December, Zoetis received marketing authorization in the EU and the U.K. for a new chewable version of Apoquel (oclacitinib), providing veterinarians and pet owners with a convenient solution to quickly and safely stop the cycle of pruritus in allergic dogs and clinical signs of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In parasiticides, the company received approval in the U.S. for a new label indication for Simparica Trio (sarolaner, moxidectin, and pyrantel chewable tablets), making it the first and only combination product demonstrated to prevent infections that may cause Lyme disease in dogs by killing deer ticks and black-legged ticks. The label expansion also included approval for the treatment and control of certain hookworms, providing a more comprehensive intestinal parasite control program.

On the livestock side of the business, Zoetis introduced new digital and data analytic solutions to help its U.S cattle producer customers improve the productivity of their farms and ranches. Earlier this

month, the company announced expansions to its precision animal health portfolio. Performance Ranch, a new cloud-based, cow-calf management software, simplifies tracking of individual animal performance and health product usage. The easy-to-use software will help cow-calf producers track and manage herd inventory, expenses, genetics and marketing opportunities. Additionally, the company’s innovative new BLOCKYARD™ platform, developed in cooperation with IBM Consulting and deployed on IBM’s Blockchain and Cloud platforms, provides a way to securely share information across production segments; this empowers cattle sellers, buyers, and industry participants by putting the valuable production, health and genetic information they need at their fingertips.

•Revenue between $8.325 billion to $8.475 billion

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Zoetis expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and operational results (which exclude the impact of foreign exchange), to assess and analyze our results and trends and to make financial and operational decisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors because they provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release should not be considered alternatives to measurements required by GAAP, such as net income, operating income, and earnings per share, and should not be considered measures of liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release and are posted on our website at www.zoetis.com.

(millions of dollars)[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses, and adjusted net income (non-GAAP financial measures) are defined as the corresponding reported U.S. GAAP income statement line items excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items.

2022 GUIDANCE 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January 2022 and includes the assumed impacts as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to weighted average foreign exchange rates from 2021, as noted above.

Reconciliations of 2022 reported guidance to 2022 adjusted guidance follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Operational growth (a non-GAAP financial measure) excludes the impact of foreign exchange.

(b) Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. GAAP net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted R&D expenses, and adjusted interest expense and other (income)/deductions-net are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. 

(c) We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted net income operational growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP reported financial measure because we are unable to calculate with reasonable certainty the foreign exchange impact of unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, potential future asset impairments and other certain significant items, without unreasonable effort. The foreign exchange impacts of these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period. 

(d) Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to acquisitions and other charges.
