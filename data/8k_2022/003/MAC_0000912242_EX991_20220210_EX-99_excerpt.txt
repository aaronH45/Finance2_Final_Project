The Macerich Company  

Executive Summary  

December 31, 2021  

We own 48 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 44 regional town centers. We specialize in successful retail properties in many of the country’s most attractive, densely populated markets with a significant presence on the West Coast, and in Arizona and the Metro New York to Washington, DC corridor. We are a recognized leader in sustainability and have achieved the #1 GRESB ranking in the North American Retail Sector for seven straight years (2015 – 2021).  

General Updates:  

Robust tenant sales and property traffic volumes continued through the holiday season. Despite the COVID-19 case rate surges from the Delta and Omicron variants, customer traffic trended strongly upward during the second half of the year. Most importantly, tenant sales continued to outpace pre-COVID levels. For the fourth quarter of 2021, portfolio comparable tenant sales from spaces less than 10,000 square feet were 12% higher than the pre-COVID fourth quarter of 2019. This followed extremely strong second and third quarter 2021 sales that exceeded their respective pre-COVID periods in 2019 by 14%. Portfolio occupancy as of December 31, 2021 showed continued improvement at 91.5%, compared to 89.7% at December 31, 2020.  

Financial Results for the Quarter:  

   •    

The net loss attributable to The Macerich Company (the “Company”) was $17.1 million or $0.08 per share-diluted during the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to the net loss attributable to the Company of $190.4 million or $1.27 per share-diluted attributable to the Company for the quarter ended December 31, 2020.  

   •    

Funds from Operations (“FFO”), excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold and loss on extinguishment of debt, was $118.7 million or $0.53 per share-diluted during the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $72.9 million or $0.45 per share-diluted for the quarter ended December 31, 2020.  

   •    

Same center net operating income (“NOI”), including lease termination income, increased 36.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, same center NOI, including lease termination income, increased 7.3% compared to 2020.  

Operations:  

   •    

Portfolio occupancy as of December 31, 2021 showed continued improvement at 91.5%, a sequential 120 basis point increase relative to the 90.3% occupancy rate on September 30, 2021.

During 2021, we announced that we are adding Scheel’s All Sports in the former Nordstrom location at Chandler Fashion Center, and that we executed leases with Target at Kings Plaza in the former JC Penney space, Lifetime Fitness at Scottsdale Fashion Square, Pinstripes at Broadway Plaza and Primark at both Green Acres Mall in the former JC Penney space and Tysons Corner. Based on our ongoing lease negotiations, we believe we will continue to execute similarly prominent deals during

Executive Summary  

December 31, 2021  

 2022. We expect that each of these new uses will greatly enhance the productivity and diversity of the tenant mix, and add the potential to significantly increase customer traffic at the applicable centers.  

   •    

Re-leasing spreads vs. expiring base rent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 were +5%.  

Redevelopment:  

We continue to ramp up our redevelopment efforts as we move past COVID-19. Some recent redevelopment highlights include:  

   •    

During the fourth quarter of 2021, our joint venture in One Westside in Los Angeles, CA delivered the approximately 584,000 square foot, three-level creative office space to Google, which is anticipated to open in summer 2022. The project remains ahead of schedule and on budget, and is fully funded by a construction loan.  

   •    

In addition to Google at One Westside, we have numerous near-term openings with many exciting and prominent larger-format users, including among many others: Scheel’s All Sports at Chandler Fashion Center, Caesar’s Republic at Scottsdale Fashion Square, Target and Ashley Furniture HomeStore at Kings Plaza, Lifetime Fitness at both Broadway Plaza and Scottsdale Fashion Square, Pinstripes at Broadway Plaza, Primark at both Green Acres Mall and Tysons Corner Center, Whole Foods at Paradise Valley Mall to anchor that mixed-use redevelopment, Dave & Buster’s and Bob’s Discount Furniture at Vintage Faire Mall, Lidl at Freehold Raceway Mall, X-Lanes at Fresno Fashion Fair and a new and expanded Apple at Tysons Corner.  

   •    

In addition to the projects noted above, we continue to secure entitlements and/or plan transformative projects to redevelop: i) the former Bloomingdale’s and Arclight Theater spaces at Santa Monica Place with entertainment and office uses, ii) the former Lord & Taylor parcel at Tysons Corner Center with mixed uses and possibly flagship retail uses, iii) the former Sears parcels at both Washington Square and Los Cerritos Center with mixed-use densification expansions, iv) FlatIron Crossing in Broomfield, Colorado with a multi-phased, mixed-use densification expansion for which we secured entitlements in late 2021, and v) Kierland Commons in Phoenix, Arizona for an expansion to add multi-family and office buildings to this highly prosperous, amenity-rich lifestyle property in northeast Phoenix.  

Balance Sheet:  

On October 26, 2021, we closed a $65 million loan to refinance the Shops at Atlas Park. On February 2, 2022, we closed a $175 million loan to refinance FlatIron Crossing in Broomfield, Colorado.  

As of the date of this filing, we have approximately $622 million of liquidity, including unrestricted cash on hand totaling over $190 million, with the balance representing available capacity on our revolving line of credit.  

As of December 31, 2021, total debt including our pro-rata share of joint ventures was $6.98 billion at a weighted average annual effective interest rate of 3.85%. We made excellent progress de-leveraging with $1.7 billion of debt repaid during 2021, which represents a 20% reduction in our share of debt since December 31, 2020.

These estimates do not include possible future gains or losses or the impact on operating results from possible future property acquisitions or dispositions, other than land sales. There can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from the estimates set forth above.  

More details of the guidance assumptions are included on page 17.  

Dividend:  

On January 27, 2022, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on March 3, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2022.

About Macerich and this Document:  

The Company is a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust, which focuses on the acquisition, leasing, management, development and redevelopment of regional town centers throughout the United States. The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, The Macerich Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”) and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Company’s management companies.  

As of December 31, 2021, the Operating Partnership owned or had an ownership interest in 48 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”) consisting primarily of interests in 44 regional town centers and five community/power shopping centers. These 49 centers (which include any adjoining mixed-use improvements) are referred to hereinafter as the “Centers” unless the context requires otherwise.  

All references to the Company in this document include the Company, those entities owned or controlled by the Company and predecessors of the Company, unless the context indicates otherwise.

The Macerich Company  

Executive Summary  

December 31, 2021  

The Company presents certain measures in this document on a pro rata basis which represents (i) the measure on a consolidated basis, minus the Company’s partners’ share of the measure from its consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners’ percentage ownership interest); plus (ii) the Company’s share of the measure from its unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the Company’s percentage ownership interest). Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors regarding its financial condition and/or results of operations because they include the Company’s share of the applicable amount from unconsolidated joint ventures and exclude the Company’s partners’ share from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. The Company has several significant joint ventures and the Company believes that presenting various measures in this manner can help investors better understand the Company’s financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account its economic interest in these joint ventures. Management also uses these measures to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. The Company’s economic interest (as distinct from its legal ownership interest) in certain of its joint ventures could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with its legal ownership interests because of provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses, payments of preferred returns and control over major decisions. Additionally, the Company does not control its unconsolidated joint ventures and the presentation of certain items, such as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, from these unconsolidated joint ventures does not represent the Company’s legal claim to such items.  

Note: This document contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements which can be identified by the use of words, such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “assumes,” “believes,” “estimated,” “guidance,” “projects,” “scheduled” and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters, and includes expectations regarding the Company’s future operational results as well as development, redevelopment and expansion activities. Stockholders are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to vary materially from those anticipated, expected or projected. Such factors include, among others, general industry, as well as national, regional and local economic and business conditions, which will, among other things, affect demand for retail space or retail goods, availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants, anchor or tenant bankruptcies, closures, mergers or consolidations, lease rates, terms and payments, interest rate fluctuations, availability, terms and cost of financing and operating expenses; adverse changes in the real estate markets including, among other things, competition from other companies, retail formats and technology, risks of real estate development and redevelopment, and acquisitions and dispositions; the continuing adverse impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on the U.S., regional and global economies and the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its tenants; the liquidity of real estate investments; governmental actions and initiatives (including legislative and regulatory changes); environmental and safety requirements; and terrorist activities or other acts of violence which could adversely affect all of the above factors. The reader is directed to the Company’s various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this document. The Company does not intend, and undertakes no obligation, to update any forward-looking information to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events unless required by law to do so.

THE MACERICH COMPANY  

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  

(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  

 (a)  

The Company accounts for its investment in the Chandler Fashion Center and Freehold Raceway Mall (“Chandler Freehold”) joint venture as a financing arrangement. As a result, the Company has included in interest expense (i) a credit of $2,782 and $15,390 to adjust for the change in the fair value of the financing arrangement obligation during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, respectively; and a credit of $42,729 and $139,522 to adjust for the change in the fair value of the financing arrangement obligation during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively; (ii) distributions of $646 and $(2,763) to its partner representing the partner’s share of net income (loss) for the three and twelve months ending December 31, 2021, respectively; and $259 and $1,144 to its partner representing the partner’s share of net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively; and (iii) distributions of $1,852 and $14,435 to its partner in excess of the partner’s share of net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, respectively; and ($259) and $3,097 to its partner in excess of the partner’s share of net (loss) income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively.  

 (b)  

The Operating Partnership has operating partnership units (“OP units”). OP units can be converted into shares of Company common stock. Conversion of the OP units not owned by the Company has been assumed for purposes of calculating FFO per share and the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The computation of average shares for FFO—diluted includes the effect of share and unit-based compensation plans, stock warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method. It also assumes conversion of MACWH, LP preferred and common units to the extent they are dilutive to the calculation.  

 (c)  

The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO-diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  

The Company accounts for its joint venture in Chandler Freehold as a financing arrangement. In connection with this treatment, the Company recognizes financing expense on (i) the changes in fair value of the financing arrangement, (ii) any payments to such joint venture partner equal to their pro rata share of net income and (iii) any payments to such joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. The Company excludes the noted expenses related to the changes in fair value and for the payments to such joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income.  

The Company also presents FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold and loss on extinguishment of debt.  

FFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. In addition, the Company believes that FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold and non-routine costs associated with extinguishment of debt provide useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance as they show a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company’s operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the Company’s results. The Company believes that FFO on a diluted basis is a measure investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of convertible securities.  

6   

THE MACERICH COMPANY  

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  

(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  

The Company further believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs.

(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Operating Income (“NOI”) and to NOI—Same Centers:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (d)  

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, noncontrolling interests in the OP, extraordinary items, loss (gain) on remeasurement, sale or write down of assets, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt and preferred dividends and includes joint ventures at their pro rata share. Management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps investors understand the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. The Company also cautions that Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.  

 (e)  

The Company presents Same Center NOI because the Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate the operating performance of comparable centers. Same Center NOI is calculated using total Adjusted EBITDA and eliminating the impact of the Management Companies’ revenues and operating expenses, leasing expenses (including joint ventures at pro rata), the Company’s REIT general and administrative expenses and the straight-line and above/below market adjustments to minimum rents and subtracting out NOI from non-Same Centers. The Company also presents Same Center NOI, excluding lease termination income, as the Company believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate operating performance without the impact of lease termination income.

The Company owns an office building and four stores located at shopping centers not owned by the Company. Of the four stores, one is leased to Kohl’s, and three have been leased for non-Anchor uses. With respect to the office building and two of the four stores, the underlying land is owned in fee entirely by the Company. With respect to the remaining two stores, the underlying land is owned by third parties and leased to the Company pursuant to long-term building or ground leases.

Construction is underway to convert former regional town center Westside Pavilion, which closed in January 2019, into an approximately 584,000 square foot Class A creative office campus called One Westside leased solely to Google, while maintaining approximately 96,000 square feet of adjacent entertainment and retail space at 10850 Pico Boulevard. The project was delivered to Google during the fourth quarter of 2021 for tenant improvement work, which has commenced.  

 (h)  

On March 29, 2021, the Company sold the former Paradise Valley Mall for $100 million to a newly formed joint venture and retained a 5% joint venture interest.

The existing Costco and JC Penney stores currently remain open, while all of the other stores at the property have closed.

The Macerich Company  

Joint Venture List as of December 31, 2021  

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Centers and other operating properties that are not wholly owned by the Company. This list of properties includes unconsolidated joint ventures, consolidated joint ventures, and financing arrangements. The percentages shown are the effective legal ownership and economic ownership interests of the Company as of December 31, 2021.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

This column reflects the Company’s legal ownership in the listed properties. Legal ownership may, at times, not equal the Company’s economic interest in the listed properties because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. As a result, the Company’s actual economic interest (as distinct from its legal ownership interest) in certain of the properties could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with its legal ownership interests. Substantially all of the Company’s joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds.  

27   

The Macerich Company  

Joint Venture List as of December 31, 2021  

 (b)  

Economic ownership represents the allocation of cash flow to the Company, except as noted below. In cases where the Company receives a current cash distribution greater than its legal ownership percentage due to a capital account greater than its legal ownership percentage, only the legal ownership percentage is shown in this column. The Company’s economic ownership of these properties may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage refinancings, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds and gains or losses from asset sales, and the matters set forth in the preceding paragraph.  

 (c)

Supplemental Financial and Operating Information (Unaudited)  

Debt Summary (at Company’s pro rata share) (a)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

The Company’s pro rata share of debt represents (i) consolidated debt, minus the Company’s partners’ share of the amount from consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners’ percentage ownership interest); plus (ii) the Company’s share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the Company’s percentage ownership interest). Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition because it includes the Company’s share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and, for consolidated debt, excludes the Company’s partners’ share from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. The Company has several significant joint ventures and presenting its pro rata share of debt in this manner can help investors better understand the Company’s financial condition after taking into account the Company’s economic interest in these joint ventures. The Company’s pro rata share of debt should not be considered as a substitute to the Company’s total debt determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
