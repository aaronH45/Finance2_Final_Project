CEO COMMENT  

“2016 was a transformational year for Spectra Energy. I’m proud of all we accomplished, but most importantly that we continued our track record of delivering on our commitments to all our stakeholders,” said Greg Ebel, chief executive officer, Spectra Energy.  

“We delivered strong DCF and dividend coverage. We successfully executed our 2016 growth plan by placing $2 billion of projects into service, and as an added benefit to our customers and investors, placed some of those projects into service ahead of schedule. We added $2.3 billion of projects to our execution backlog, including the $1.5 billion Valley Crossing Pipeline project. DCP Midstream surpassed its 35-cent NGL break-even target, paving the way for the restructuring and simplification it announced in January 2017. And through all this activity we also maintained a healthy balance sheet.  

“Our achievements and accomplishments in 2016, coupled with those of the past decade, have positioned us well for 2017 and beyond, as we move closer to  

2  

 completing our combination with Enbridge, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of this year. While we announced our 14-cent per share annual dividend increase for 2017, the combination with Enbridge will greatly accelerate our dividend growth, from 8 percent annually to 15 percent in 2017 and an expected 10 to 12 percent annually through 2024.  

“During these past 10 years, we’ve expanded our footprint, diversified our asset portfolio, reduced our risk profile and provided a dependable, attractive dividend, creating tremendous shareholder value in that process. We have proven to be a stable, disciplined and reliable investment. It has been an honor to serve as CEO for the past eight years, and I am proud of our company and the great people who have contributed to its success. As incoming chairman of the new Enbridge, I look forward to the company taking our next big step. I fully expect we will deliver even greater benefits to our investors, customers, communities and employees.”  

SEGMENT RESULTS  

Spectra Energy Partners  

Ongoing EBITDA from Spectra Energy Partners was $537 million in fourth quarter 2016, compared with $484 million in fourth quarter 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 ongoing results reflect increased earnings from expansion projects placed into service in the second half of 2016 in both the natural gas transmission and liquids businesses, as well as higher Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC), primarily from the Sabal Trail project. These increases were offset by the absence of equity earnings from Sand Hills and Southern Hills natural gas liquids (NGL) pipelines, which Spectra Energy Partners owned through October 2015. Earnings from these NGL pipeline interests have been reflected in the Field Services segment. Fourth quarter 2016 results exclude a special item of $36 million for inspection and repair efforts associated with the Texas Eastern pipeline incident.  

3  

For the year 2016, ongoing EBITDA for Spectra Energy Partners was $2 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in 2015. The 2016 period excludes a special item of $80 million for inspection and repair efforts associated with the Texas Eastern pipeline incident. The 2015 period excludes a special item of $9 million related to a non-cash impairment of the Ozark Gas Gathering asset.  

Distribution  

Distribution EBITDA was $122 million in fourth quarter 2016, compared with $113 million in fourth quarter 2015. This increase was mainly due to incremental earnings from the Dawn-Parkway expansion projects and colder weather.  

For the years 2016 and 2015, EBITDA for Distribution was $473 million.  

Western Canada Transmission & Processing  

Ongoing EBITDA from Western Canada Transmission & Processing was $105 million in fourth quarter 2016, compared with $123 million in fourth quarter 2015. The segment’s ongoing results largely reflect lower gathering and processing revenues. Fourth quarter 2016 results exclude special items of $31 million, primarily from a non-cash loss on the sale of assets, as well as from continued contract demand credits net of insurance recoveries at our Grizzly Valley operations in British Columbia associated with significant flooding in June. Fourth quarter 2015 results exclude special items of $14 million for employee and overhead reductions and a non-cash asset impairment.  

For the year 2016, ongoing EBITDA for Western Canada Transmission & Processing was $443 million, compared with $516 million in 2015. The 2016 period excludes special items of $56 million for contract demand credits net of insurance recoveries associated with flooding in British Columbia, employee and overhead reductions, and a non-cash loss on the sale of assets. The 2015 period excludes special items of $25 million related to employee and overhead reduction costs and a non-cash asset impairment.  

4  

Field Services  

Ongoing EBITDA from Field Services was $(5) million in fourth quarter 2016, compared with $(36) million in fourth quarter 2015. The segment’s ongoing results reflect favorable contract realignment efforts, stronger commodity prices, and asset growth, offset by lower volumes in certain geographic regions. Fourth quarter 2016 results exclude special items of $36 million, primarily reflecting income tax expense associated with the transaction converting a C-Corp subsidiary of DCP Midstream to an LLC, as well as transaction costs related to combining DCP Midstream and DCP Partners. The 2015 period excludes special items of $172 million, primarily from non-cash asset impairments. As a reminder, Spectra Energy’s EBITDA from Field Services represents the company’s 50 percent share of DCP Midstream’s net income plus gains from DPM unit issuances.  

For the year 2016, ongoing EBITDA for Field Services was $14 million, compared with $(106) million in 2015. The 2016 period excludes special items of $54 million, mainly from converting a C-Corp subsidiary of DCP Midstream to an LLC, transaction costs related to combining DCP Midstream and DCP Partners, and non-cash asset impairments. The 2015 period excludes $355 million in charges, primarily due to non-cash goodwill and asset impairments.  

During the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, NGL prices averaged $0.55 per gallon versus $0.42 per gallon, NYMEX natural gas averaged $2.98 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) versus $2.27 per MMBtu, and crude oil averaged approximately $49 per barrel versus $42 per barrel.  

On a full-year basis for 2016 and 2015, respectively, NGL prices averaged $0.46 per gallon versus $0.45 per gallon, NYMEX natural gas averaged $2.46 per MMBtu versus $2.66 per MMBtu and crude oil averaged approximately $43 per barrel versus $49 per barrel.  

5  

Other  

Ongoing net expenses from “Other” were $17 million and $12 million in the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fourth quarter 2016 results exclude special items of $24 million for transaction costs related to the proposed merger with Enbridge and captive insurance claims related to the flooding in British Columbia. The 2015 period excludes a special item of $333 million related to non-cash goodwill impairments associated with the Westcoast Energy acquisition in 2002.  

For the year 2016, ongoing net expenses from “Other” were $73 million, compared with $51 million in 2015. The 2016 period excludes special items of $53 million for transaction costs and self-insurance charges related to the Texas Eastern pipeline incident and flooding in British Columbia. The 2015 period excludes special items of $333 million related to non-cash goodwill impairments associated with the Westcoast Energy acquisition.  

“Other” primarily consists of corporate expenses, including benefits and captive insurance.  

Interest Expense  

Interest expense was $157 million in fourth quarter 2016, compared with $156 million in fourth quarter 2015.  

For the year 2016, interest expense was $594 million, compared with $636 million in 2015.  

Income Tax Expense  

Income tax expense was $56 million in fourth quarter 2016, compared with an income tax benefit of $3 million in fourth quarter 2015, with effective tax rates of 21 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Excluding the tax impacts of special items in both periods, income tax expense was $88 million in fourth quarter 2016, compared with $65 million in fourth quarter 2015, with effective tax rates of 23 percent and 20 percent, respectively. The higher income tax expense was primarily due to higher earnings.  

6  

For the year 2016, income tax expense was $216 million, compared with $161 million in 2015, with effective tax rates of 18 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Excluding the tax impacts of special items in both periods, income tax expense was $304 million in both 2016 and 2015, with effective tax rates of 21 percent and 23 percent, respectively.  

Foreign Currency  

Net income from controlling interests was lower by $2 million for the quarter and $10 million for the year due to the lower Canadian dollar.  

Liquidity and Capital Expenditures  

Total debt outstanding at Spectra Energy as of December 31, 2016, was $15.6 billion. Total Spectra Energy liquidity at the end of the quarter was $5.2 billion, including $2.1 billion of available liquidity at Spectra Energy Partners.  

Including contributions from noncontrolling interests of $743 million, total capital and investment spending for the year was $3.1 billion, and consisted of about $2.5 billion of growth capital expenditures and $613 million of maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures include special items of $28 million related to the Texas Eastern pipeline incident and $7 million related to flooding in British Columbia.  

Spectra Energy expects to file its 2016 10-K with the SEC on or before March 1, 2017.

   •   AIM  

Projects Scheduled for 2017 In-Service  

Construction on Sabal Trail continues to progress, and the project remains on track to be in-service during the first half of 2017.  

The Access South, Adair Southwest, and Lebanon Extension projects commenced construction in January, and are scheduled to be placed in-service in the second half of this year.  

The second phase of the Gulf Markets Expansion project continues to advance toward a second half of 2017 in-service date. The project has received all its regulatory permits and is under construction.  

Atlantic Bridge received its FERC Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in January, and is targeting initial in-service in the fourth quarter of this year.  

9  

NEXUS and TEAL anticipate receiving their FERC certificates shortly after FERC again has a quorum. Subject to a prompt issuance of these certificates, the project team has a safe and environmentally responsible plan to place the facilities into service in the fourth quarter of 2017, within the prescribed construction windows, in order to meet shipper requirements. Infrastructure projects are a top priority for the new administration and we are confident it will take swift action to restore a FERC quorum.  

Projects in Western Canada continue to advance toward their respective in-service dates, specifically Jackfish Lake (first half of this year) as well as RAM and High Pine (second half of this year). All three projects have received their regulatory permits, and are under construction.  

At Union Gas, both the 2017 Dawn-Parkway expansion and the Panhandle Reinforcement projects remain on schedule to be placed in-service in the second half of this year.  

In January 2017, DCP Midstream announced a number of significant expansion projects, including compression and infrastructure expansions that will add approximately 40 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of incremental capacity by the summer of 2017 in the DJ Basin, and an 85,000 barrel-per-day expansion of the Sand Hills NGL pipeline expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2017.  

Projects Scheduled for 2018 In-Service  

The Bayway Lateral project continues to progress toward an in-service date in the first half of 2018, as does Western Canada’s Wyndwood project, while the STEP project continues to target in-service in the second half of 2018.  

The Valley Crossing Pipeline is advancing through the regulatory process and continues to target an in-service date in the second half of 2018. Construction is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2017.  

10  

The PennEast project continues to advance as well. FERC is expected to issue its Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) in April, and the project is still targeting a late-2018 in-service date.  

New to the company’s project portfolio this quarter is the Spruce Ridge project, a $500 million supply-push project in Western Canada that is expected to go into service in the second half of 2018. The project involves a 400 MMcf/d expansion of the T-North transmission system, as well as pipeline looping and additional compression, to facilitate T-North producers’ access to downstream markets.  

DCP Midstream also announced a 200 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant in the DJ Basin that is projected to be in-service by the end of 2018.  

Projects Scheduled for 2019 In-Service  

The Stratton Ridge project filed its FERC application earlier this month and remains on schedule for in-service in the first half of 2019.  

Projects in Development  

The Access Northeast project would help alleviate New England’s well-documented issues of energy reliability and cost volatility. The project’s partners continue to pursue a viable commercial and operational model to provide clean-burning natural gas to gas-fired electric generators in New England in support of the region’s emission goals.  

While the project has been in discussions on other contracting strategies, including participation among gas distribution companies, the complexity of any regional solution requires clarity among the New England states regarding the support and legal authority for electric distribution companies to contract for project capacity. When the states achieve alignment – in the form of consistent legislative or other legal authority supporting natural gas infrastructure for electric reliability – the project’s partners remain able and committed to bringing Access Northeast to New England consumers.  

11  

With increasing reliance on natural gas for electric generation, this project provides a critical opportunity to improve New England’s future energy reliability, cost volatility and competitiveness. Access Northeast’s partners will continue working with state and federal agencies, as well as other stakeholders, to help close gaps in legal authority that are currently prohibiting the region from achieving its significant environmental goals, as the current system configuration requires the continued operation of older, higher emitting generation units, such as coal and oil plants.  

Spectra Energy Partners conducted solicitations of interest on the Express Pipeline and Platte Pipeline in late 2016, and is currently conducting subsequent solicitations, which will close by the end of February.  

Spectra Energy Partners has secured a commitment from an industrial market shipper in the STX Zone of its Texas Eastern system, and on February 15 launched a Texas-Louisiana Markets open season, which will close in early March, to solicit additional interest.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

We use ongoing net income from controlling interests and ongoing diluted EPS as measures to evaluate operations of the company. These measures are non-GAAP financial measures as they represent net income from controlling interests and diluted EPS, excluding special items. Special items represent certain charges and credits which we believe will not be recurring on a regular basis. We believe that the presentation of ongoing net income from controlling interests and ongoing diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it allows investors to more accurately compare our ongoing performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for ongoing net income from controlling interests and ongoing diluted EPS are net income from controlling interests and diluted EPS.  

12  

We use earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and ongoing EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, as performance measures for Spectra Energy Corp. Ongoing EBITDA represents EBITDA, excluding special items. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and ongoing EBITDA provides useful information to investors, as it allows investors to more accurately compare Spectra Energy Corp’s performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for EBITDA and ongoing EBITDA for Spectra Energy Corp is net income.  

The primary performance measures used by us to evaluate segment performance are segment EBITDA and Other EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA and Other EBITDA, which are the GAAP measures used to report segment results, to be good indicators of each segment’s operating performance from its continuing operations as they represent the results of our segments’ operations before depreciation and amortization without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA and Other EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.  

We also use ongoing segment EBITDA and ongoing Other EBITDA (net expenses) as measures of performance. Ongoing segment EBITDA and ongoing Other EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures, as they represent segment EBITDA and Other EBITDA, excluding special items. We believe that the presentation of ongoing segment EBITDA and ongoing Other EBITDA provides useful information to investors, as it allows investors to more accurately compare a segment’s or Other’s ongoing performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for ongoing segment EBITDA and ongoing Other EBITDA are segment EBITDA and Other EBITDA.  

We also present Distributable Cash Flow (DCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of DCF provides useful information to  

13  

 investors, as it represents the cash generation capabilities of the company to support dividend growth. We also use ongoing DCF, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it represents DCF, excluding the cash effect of special items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for DCF and ongoing DCF is net income. We also use DCF coverage, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it represents DCF divided by dividends declared on common stock. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for DCF coverage is EPS.  

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate these measures in the same manner.
