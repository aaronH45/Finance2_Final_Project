“ONEOK reported strong 2016 financial performance as a result of ONEOK Partners’ adjusted EBITDA increasing nearly 18 percent compared with 2015, driven by higher fee-based earnings in all three business segments,” said Terry K. Spencer, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. “ONEOK maintained its healthy dividend coverage throughout 2016, ending with full-year coverage of 1.31 times and approximately $250 million in cash.

 “The natural gas gathering and processing segment’s 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 40 percent compared with 2015, driven by higher average fee rates from contract restructuring efforts primarily completed in 2015 and benefiting 2016 earnings,” continued Spencer. “The natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines segments also reported higher full-year 2016 results, largely from increased fee-based exchange and transportation services, respectively. Higher natural gas volumes processed and higher natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes fractioned also helped increase full-year 2016 earnings. 

“We experienced lower than expected natural gas and NGL volumes in the fourth quarter primarily due to increased ethane rejection and severe winter weather in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent in December, impacting 2016 results by an estimated $15 million,” he continued. “However, despite weather impacts, natural gas volumes processed continued to increase in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter 2016. While heavy snowfall and severe weather in the Williston Basin impacted our operations early in the first quarter of 2017, February volumes have rebounded significantly.

  “Looking ahead to the remainder of 2017, we are well-positioned to capture future increases in NGL transportation and fractionation volumes due to increased demand from the petrochemical industry and NGL export activity without significant capital spending,” said Spencer. “ONEOK’s 2017 guidance expectations already take into account the weather impacts experienced in late 2016 and in early 2017.

“Increased producer activity across our operating footprint is expected to benefit all three business segments in 2017,” Spencer continued. “Our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments are well-positioned to capture anticipated increases in volumes from the highly productive STACK and SCOOP areas in Oklahoma, and the Permian Basin in West Texas.

“The recently announced transaction with ONEOK Partners, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2017, positions our businesses for continued growth,” Spencer concluded. “As a company with access to a more liquid equity market, ONEOK will be better able to fund its future capital needs over the long-term as we continue expanding our footprint in the active basins we serve and continue growing as one of North America’s largest midstream service providers.”

FOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2016 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

ONEOK Partners’ (NYSE: OKS) integrated asset footprint across multiple NGL-rich shale plays continues to drive growth across all three business segments. Producer activity continued to increase during the fourth quarter 2016, specifically in the STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma and in the Williston and Permian basins, where ONEOK Partners has a strong natural gas and NGL asset position. 

ONEOK’s fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 operating income increased 36 and 29 percent, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2015, benefiting from higher NGL and natural gas volumes from completed capital-growth projects, new natural gas processing plant connections to the partnership’s natural gas liquids system and higher average fee rates in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.

All three business segments reported higher full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA, compared with 2015, primarily from increased fee-based services across the partnership’s footprint. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Higher fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results primarily benefited from: 

•Higher average fee rates resulting from contract restructuring in the natural gas gathering and processing segment; 

•Higher NGL fee-based exchange-services revenues, primarily from recently connected natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin and increased Mid-Continent volumes gathered in the STACK and SCOOP plays, offset partially by lower volumes due to the impact of severe weather and increased ethane rejection in December 2016, and lower rates on the West Texas LPG system;

•Natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin; and

•Higher firm demand charge transportation revenues in the natural gas pipelines segment.

Operating costs increased in the three-month and full-year 2016 periods, compared with the same periods in 2015, due primarily to higher labor costs associated with the growth of ONEOK Partners’ operations, higher employee-related costs associated with incentive and medical benefit plans and higher costs associated with noncash mark-to-market of a share-based deferred compensation plan due to the increase in ONEOK’s share price.

Capital expenditures decreased in the three-month and full-year 2016 periods, compared with the same periods in 2015, due to projects placed in service and proactive spending reductions to align with customer needs.

BUSINESS-SEGMENT RESULTS:

Key financial and operating statistics are listed on page 20 in the tables.

Natural Gas Liquids Segment

The natural gas liquids segment’s full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 11 percent compared with 2015, benefiting from new natural gas processing plant connections and increased ethane recovery. The segment connected six new natural gas processing plants to its system during the year, including the partnership’s Bear Creek plant in the Williston Basin and five third-party connections - two each in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent and one in the Permian Basin. Growing producer activity in these basins continues to increase the need for NGL takeaway options, particularly in the Permian Basin and in the STACK play in Oklahoma where the partnership is well-positioned as the primary NGL transportation provider. 

Full-year 2016 NGLs fractionated increased 6 percent, compared with 2015 due to increased volumes from new plant connections, increased ethane recovery and increased Mid-Continent volumes gathered in the STACK and SCOOP areas. Fourth-quarter 2016 NGLs fractionated remained relatively unchanged compared with the fourth quarter 2015. NGLs transported on gathering lines decreased 7 percent in the fourth quarter 2016 compared with the fourth quarter 2015 and full-year 2016 volumes gathered remained essentially unchanged compared with 2015 due to decreased volumes on the West Texas LPG pipeline system and decreased Mid-Continent volumes gathered from the Barnett Shale due to lower short-term contracted volumes and the impact of severe weather on gathered volumes.

Page 6

The decrease in fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA, compared with the fourth quarter 2015, primarily reflects:

•A $13.2 million decrease in exchange services due to lower short-term contracted volumes in the Mid-Continent, lower volumes and rates on the West Texas LPG pipeline system, lower volumes in the Barnett Shale and Granite Wash regions, lower revenues from minimum volume obligations, and the impact of severe weather and increased ethane rejection in December 2016; offset partially by higher Williston Basin volumes from recently connected natural gas processing plants; 

•A $13.2 million decrease in optimization and marketing activities due primarily to narrower marketing product price differentials in 2016; and

•A $10.5 million increase in operating costs due primarily to higher employee-related costs associated with incentive and medical benefit plans, and higher materials and outside services expenses; offset partially by

•A $4.4 million increase from higher isomerization volumes; and 

•A $2.7 million increase due to the impact of operational measurement gains in 2016 and operational measurement losses in 2015.

The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2016, compared with 2015, primarily reflects:

•A $90.0 million increase in exchange services due to increased exchange service volumes from recently connected natural gas processing plants primarily in the Williston Basin, increased Mid-Continent volumes gathered in the STACK and SCOOP areas and increased ethane recovery primarily in the Williston Basin to maintain downstream NGL product specifications; offset partially by lower volumes and rates on the West Texas LPG pipeline system and the impact of weather across the partnership’s system in December 2016; 

•A $15.8 million increase in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher volumes delivered to the Overland Pass Pipeline from the Bakken NGL Pipeline;

•A $13.8 million increase in transportation and storage services due to higher storage and terminaling revenue in the Gulf Coast and revenues from minimum volume obligations on the North System Pipeline;

•An $8.4 million increase from higher isomerization volumes; and

•A $4.3 million increase due to the impact of operational measurement gains in 2016 and operational measurement losses in 2015; offset partially by 

•A $13.8 million decrease from decreased marketing activities due primarily to narrower product price differentials, offset partially by higher optimization volumes; and 

•A $13.1 million increase in operating costs due primarily to higher employee-related costs associated with incentive and medical benefit plans.

Capital expenditures decreased for the three-month and full-year 2016 periods, compared

with the same periods in 2015, due primarily to projects placed in service and proactive spending reductions to align with customer needs. 

Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Segment

The natural gas gathering and processing segment’s fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 30 and 40 percent, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2015. The segment’s strong financial results were driven by higher average fee rates from contract restructuring efforts and continued volume growth in the Rocky Mountain region from recently completed capital-growth projects. 

The segment’s average fee rate for the fourth quarter 2016 was 84 cents, compared with 55 cents in the fourth quarter 2015. The full-year 2016 fee rate averaged 76 cents, compared with 44 cents in 2015. 

Fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 natural gas volumes processed increased 2 and 12 percent, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2015, primarily due to recently completed capital-growth projects in the Rocky Mountain region. Volume growth was offset partially by natural production declines in the Mid-Continent and the impact of weather in the Williston Basin in December 2016. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased, compared with the fourth quarter 2015, which primarily reflects:

•A $37.8 million increase due primarily to restructured contracts resulting in higher average fee rates, offset partially by a lower percentage of proceeds (POP) retained from the sale of commodities under POP with fee contracts; and 

•An $8.0 million increase due to contract settlements; offset partially by

•An $11.7 million decrease due to lower net realized NGL and natural gas prices.

The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2016, compared with 2015, primarily reflects:

•A $144.3 million increase due primarily to restructured contracts resulting in higher average fee rates, offset partially by a lower percentage of proceeds retained from the sale of commodities under POP with fee contracts; 

•A $92.2 million increase due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the Rocky Mountain region, offset partially by volume declines in the Mid-Continent and the impact of weather in the Williston Basin in December 2016; and

•An $8.0 million increase due to contract settlements; offset partially by

•A $91.9 million decrease due primarily to lower net realized NGL and natural gas prices;

•A $13.2 million increase in operating costs due primarily to the growth of the partnership’s operations resulting from completed capital-growth projects and higher employee-related costs associated with incentive and medical benefit plans; 

•A $7.2 million decrease in equity in net earnings from investments primarily in the coal-bed methane area of the Powder River Basin; and

•A $4.0 million decrease due primarily to increased ethane recovery to maintain downstream NGL product specifications.

Capital expenditures decreased for the three-month and full-year 2016 periods, compared with the same periods in 2015, due to projects placed in service and proactive spending reductions to align with customer needs in 2016. 

The following table contains equity-volume information for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The natural gas gathering and processing segment has restructured a portion of its percent-of-proceeds with fee contracts to include significantly higher fees, which reduced its 2016 equity volumes and the related commodity price exposure compared with 2015. 

Natural Gas Pipelines Segment 

The natural gas pipelines segment’s fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 22 and 14 percent, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2015. The segment

Full-year 2016 Financial Results

Feb. 27, 2017

Page 9

continues to benefit from higher fee-based earnings driven by increased firm demand charge contracted capacity and capital-growth projects placed in service.

 The segment recently announced an expansion of the ONEOK Gas Transmission Pipeline which consists of adding compressor facilities to allow for additional takeaway out of the STACK play in Oklahoma. The partnership has secured a firm commitment for 100 MMcf/d of capacity on the pipeline with the potential for additional producer commitments. The expansion is expected to be complete in the second quarter 2018. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased, compared with the fourth quarter 2015, which primarily reflects:

•An $11.4 million increase from higher transportation services due primarily to increased firm demand charge capacity contracted; 

•A $7.0 million increase from higher net retained fuel due primarily to higher throughput and the associated natural gas volumes retained and higher equity natural gas sales; and

•A $6.6 million increase in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher firm transportation on the Northern Border and Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipelines; offset partially by

•A $4.0 million increase in operating costs due primarily to higher employee related costs associated with incentive and medical benefit plans. 

The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2016, compared with 2015, primarily reflects:

•A $28.5 million increase from higher transportation services due primarily to increased firm demand charge capacity contracted; 

•A $9.3 million increase from higher net retained fuel due to higher throughput and higher equity natural gas sales related to transportation and storage services;

•A $6.6 million increase due to higher natural gas storage services as a result of increased storage rates and the increased sales of excess natural gas in storage; and

•A $5.7 million increase in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher firm transportation revenues on the Northern Border and Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipelines; offset partially by

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE:

ONEOK has disclosed in this news release adjusted EBITDA, cash flow available for dividends, free cash flow and dividend coverage ratio, and ONEOK Partners distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio, which are non-GAAP financial metrics, used to measure the company’s financial performance and are defined as follows:

•Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, net of capitalized interest, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, income taxes and allowance for equity funds used during construction and certain other noncash items; 

•Cash flow available for dividends is defined as cash distributions declared from ONEOK’s ownership in ONEOK Partners adjusted for ONEOK’s standalone interest expense, corporate expenses, excluding certain noncash items, payments related to released contracts from ONEOK’s former energy services business, capital expenditures and equity compensation reimbursed by ONEOK Partners; 

•Free cash flow is defined as cash flow available for dividends, computed as described above, less ONEOK’s dividends declared; 

•Dividend coverage ratio is defined as cash flow available for dividends divided by the dividends declared for the period;

•Distributable cash flow is defined as ONEOK Partners adjusted EBITDA, computed as described above, less interest expense, maintenance capital expenditures and equity earnings from investments, excluding noncash impairment charges, adjusted for cash distributions received and certain other items; and

•Cash distribution coverage ratio is defined as ONEOK Partners distributable cash flow to limited partners per limited partner unit divided by the distribution declared per limited partner unit for the period.

These non-GAAP financial measures described above are useful to investors because they are used by many companies in the industry as a measurement of financial performance and are commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare our financial performance with the performance of other companies within our industry. Adjusted EBITDA, ONEOK cash flow available for dividends, free cash flow and dividend coverage ratio, and ONEOK Partners distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA, cash flow available for dividends and free cash flow to net income, and ONEOK Partners adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio to ONEOK Partners net income, are included in the tables.
