For the fourth quarter of 2016, diluted earnings per share were $2.67, compared to $2.67 for the same period of 2015, and Economic earnings per share (“Economic EPS”) were $3.80, compared to $3.59 for the same period of 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Net income was $150.2 million, compared to $147.5 million for the same period of 2015.

For the fourth quarter of 2016, Adjusted EBITDA was $289.7 million, compared to $263.1 million for the same period of 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Revenue was $550.3 million, compared to $589.8 million for the same period of 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Aggregate revenue, which includes revenue from consolidated Affiliates as well as Equity method revenue (which represents asset-based fees and performance fees earned by Affiliates accounted for under the equity method), was $1.3 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the same period of 2015. (Economic EPS, Economic net income, and Adjusted EBITDA are defined in the attached tables, along with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.)  

For the year ended December 31, 2016, diluted earnings per share were $8.57, compared to $9.17 for 2015, and Economic earnings per share were $12.84, compared to $12.47 for 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Net income was $472.8 million, compared to $509.5 million for 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Economic net income was $703.6 million, compared to $687.2 million for 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Adjusted EBITDA was $945.5 million, compared to $942.2 million for 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Revenue was $2.2 billion, compared to $2.5 billion for 2015, and Aggregate revenue was $4.3 billion, compared to $4.1 billion for 2015.

“AMG generated strong results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2016, including Economic earnings per share of $3.80 for the fourth quarter and $12.84 for the full year, both at record levels and representing earnings growth of 6% and 3% for each period, respectively,” stated Sean M. Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMG. “Against the backdrop of earnings declines across the asset management industry broadly, we continued to produce growth in our earnings, even with only a partial impact from investments closed during the second half of the year. With assets under management increasing 16% year-over-year to $727 billion, we enhanced the earnings power of our business through successful execution across all aspects of our growth strategy – including positive organic growth from net client cash flows in 2016, the long-term investment outperformance of our Affiliates, and the addition of outstanding new Affiliates during the year.”  

“While we saw modest outflows in the fourth quarter, driven in large part by anticipated seasonal client redemptions and realization activity in private equity and similar strategies, our Affiliates generated positive net client cash flows of $7.4 billion for the full year across our diverse active equity and alternative product set, notwithstanding industry-wide net outflows in alpha-oriented product areas,” Mr. Healey continued. “Given increased dispersion of asset returns and post-election expectations for regulatory reform and economic growth, high-conviction active managers are positioned to outperform passive products. The best managers will distinguish themselves in this environment, which will benefit AMG across our broad array of industry-leading active equity and alternative strategies, given our Affiliates’ outstanding track records of investment outperformance.”  

“We were pleased to add a number of excellent new Affiliates in 2016 through the continued successful execution of our new investments strategy, and the quality of these firms, including Winton, Capula, and Baring Asia, reflects AMG’s competitive position as the partner of choice for leading independent firms around the world,” Mr. Healey concluded. “Looking ahead, given the significant and growing scale of our business, we are confident in our ability to continue to generate meaningful earnings growth through accretive investments in outstanding new Affiliates, while also consistently returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and now a dividend. With this disciplined commitment to capital allocation, along with the organic growth of existing Affiliates, we are uniquely positioned to generate long-term shareholder value.”

Notes  

(in millions, except per share data)  

 (A) In the third quarter, we revised our previously-issued Consolidated Financial Statements for periods prior to 2016 to correct for an error related to deferred tax benefits recognized on certain Affiliate equity transactions. The impact on all quarterly and annual periods in our previously-issued Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.  

The tables below show the effect of correcting the misstatement on our Consolidated Statements of Income, Performance Measures and Consolidated Balance Sheet. The revision had no impact on Income before income taxes or Total stockholders’ equity.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (B) Equity method revenue represents asset-based and performance fees earned by our Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Equity method revenue provides management with additional information on the operating performance of our equity method Affiliates. Equity method revenue is also combined with revenue from consolidated Affiliates to determine Aggregate revenue, which is an aggregate Affiliate operating measure used by management to evaluate operational trends across all of our Affiliates, regardless of accounting treatment.  

 (C) Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method investments in Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents operating performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to the acquisition of interests in our affiliated investment management firms, and it is therefore employed as our principal performance benchmark. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measure of financial performance.  

We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in the value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed  

-12-  

AMG  

Notes (continued)  

(in millions, except per share data)  

interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders.  

 (D) Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. We believe that many investors use this information when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measure of financial performance. The title of this performance measure has been renamed from EBITDA (controlling interest) to Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). There has been no change in the calculation of this performance measure.  

 (E) Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of the convertible securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion. Economic earnings per share is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Earnings per share (diluted) or any other GAAP measure of financial performance.  

 (F) We completed our investments in Systematica Investments L.P. and Baring Private Equity Asia in the first quarter of 2016; the financial results of these investments are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning in the first quarter of 2016. We completed our investments in Capula Investment Management LLP and Partner Fund Management, L.P. in the third quarter of 2016; the financial results of these investments are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 (one quarter in arrears). We completed our investment in Winton Capital Group Ltd. in the fourth quarter of 2016; the financial results of this investment will also be included in the Consolidated Financial Statements one quarter in arrears (beginning in the first quarter of 2017).  

 (G) For the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, Other economic items are net of income taxes of $0.1 and $1.5, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, Other economic items are net of income taxes of $15.2 and $1.4, respectively.  

 (H) In the fourth quarter of 2016, Third Avenue Management LLC recorded a reserve of $15 million in connection with a proposed resolution of all claims relating to the Focused Credit Fund, which is subject to court approvals and would be funded by Third Avenue with cash on hand. AMG would not fund any portion of the expense and it has no impact on Net Income (controlling interest) or Economic net income (controlling interest).  

 (I) For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, Imputed interest and contingent payment arrangements include gains from adjustments to our contingent payment obligations of $44.7 and $2.8, respectively. There were no contingent payment adjustments in the three months ended December 31, 2015 or 2016.
