Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.

The information set forth below under Item 5.03 regarding the amended and restated by-laws (the “Amended and Restated By-Laws”) of PulteGroup, Inc. (the “Company”) is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.03.

Item 5.03.Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On February 10, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted Amended and Restated By-Laws, effective the same date. The primary purposes of the amendment and restatement was to change the voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections from a plurality standard to a majority standard and to implement proxy access and make related changes to the advance notice provisions related to director nominations.

New Section 3.11 of the Amended and Restated By-Laws implements proxy access and permits a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, owning 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the number of the Company’s directors then serving, provided the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Amended and Restated By-Laws. Proxy access will first apply with respect to the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

The amendments to the Amended and Restated By-Laws also include clarifications, updates and conforming revisions to the advance notice provisions in Section 3.10 applicable to any shareholder who wishes to nominate directors, including information to be included in and with the notice.

The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated By-Laws (with amendments marked) filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference. A clean copy of the Amended and Restated By-Laws is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.2.
