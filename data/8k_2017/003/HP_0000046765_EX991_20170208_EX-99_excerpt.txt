Very strong balance sheet Most capable land drilling fleet Market share leader in the U.S. Robust term contract backlog Operational strategy focused on continued innovation, safety, performance excellence, reliability and customer satisfaction About Helmerich & Payne (H&P) 

H&P’s Strong Balance Sheet (As of September 30, 2016) 1. Total Capitalization is defined as Total Debt plus Shareholders' Equity. Total-Debt-to-Total-Capitalization Ratio1 Source: Company Filings.

H&P’s Global Rig Fleet * Estimates include existing rigs and announced new build commitments. 

U.S. Land Market Share Leader Note: The above estimates corresponding to market share are derived from Rig Data. Additionally, the drawworks capacity of each land rig included in the above analysis was equal to or greater than 600 horsepower. As of January 2017 (~730 Active Rigs in U.S. Land) 

H&P Global Fleet Under Term Contract The above term contract coverage excludes long-term contracts for which the Company received early contract termination notifications as of 2/8/17. Given notifications as of 2/8/17, the Company expects to generate approximately $6 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2017 and over $25 million thereafter from early terminations corresponding to long-term contracts. Additionally, related to the notification of five rigs previously under long-term contracts in Argentina, the company expects early termination fees to further favorably impact operating income in the near future. All of the above rig contracts include provisions for early termination fees. Some of the new build deliveries may be delayed in exchange for compensation from customers, but the corresponding total backlog would remain the same or potentially increase. * 

H&P vs. Industry U.S. Land Customer Base Note: The above estimates corresponding to the active rig fleet in the U.S. are derived from multiple sources including Rig Data. The category “Large Operators” includes majors and large independent E&P operators. 

U.S. Land Drilling Market Conditions The outlook has been improving, and there is greater optimism in the market. The level of demand for contract drilling services has been rapidly increasing. Customer well designs are increasingly more complex and require high quality, high performing AC drive rigs. The market is providing a great opportunity for the reactivation of AC drive rigs with the right capabilities. Spot pricing remains low, but it is moving from the mid-teens to the high-teens level for high quality, high performing AC drive rigs. 

Drilling Activity in the U.S. 

Note: The above estimates corresponding to horizontal and directional rig activity by power type are derived from multiple sources including Rig Data and corporate filings.

* Roughly 60% are optimal for multiple-well pad drilling applications. H&P U.S. Land Fleet – Family of SolutionsTM 1,500 hp AC Drive FlexRigs*, including 270 Upgraded or Upgradeable to Rig Specifications in High Demand** 350 Available H&P U.S. Land Rigs ** AC drive FlexRigs with 1,500 hp drawworks and 750,000# hookload ratings (270) that do not already have 7,500 psi mud circulating systems and multiple-well pad drilling systems can be upgraded to include these two capabilities. These five combined rig specifications are in high demand and fit the description of what some industry followers refer to as “super-spec” rigs (“Upgraded”). Additional capabilities, including third mud pumps, 25,000’ setback, increased mud volume, etc., may also be included to meet customer requirements.

Leading U.S. Unconventional Driller (142 H&P Contracted Land Rigs as of 2/8/17) 

Ongoing U.S. Land Market Trends Unconventional plays continue to shape the landscape. Well designs are increasingly complex, including longer laterals and more challenging drilling requirements. Customers continue to focus on safety, efficiency, technology, and reliable drilling performance. AC drive rigs are best suited and continue to be upgraded for more demanding drilling requirements. The replacement cycle is expected to continue.
