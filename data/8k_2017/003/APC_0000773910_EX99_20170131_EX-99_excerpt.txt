2016 HIGHLIGHTS

•Surpassed initial sales-volume expectations by 11 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) on a same-store-sales basis,(2) while keeping capital investments within initial guidance

•Closed more than $4.0 billion of monetizations in 2016, with an additional $3.5 billion of announced divestitures, which are expected to close in the first quarter of 2017

•Achieved operating milestones including production records at Lucius, Caesar/Tonga and in the Delaware and DJ basins, as well as first oil at Heidelberg and TEN

•Closed the immediately accretive Freeport-McMoRan deepwater Gulf of Mexico acquisition

•Increased the expected five-year compounded annual oil growth rate to 12 to 14 percent

“Our employees did outstanding work over the past year to overcome the prolonged market challenges and sharpen the company’s competitive focus going forward,” said Al Walker, Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO. “As a result of these actions, we have a stronger balance sheet, an improved cost structure, and a more concentrated portfolio focused on higher-margin oil production provided by our leading positions in the Delaware and DJ basins and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These accomplishments, along with our monetization activities, the cash-generating capabilities of our international operations, a successful exploration program, and the acquisition of Freeport-McMoRan’s Gulf of Mexico properties, have created strong momentum going into 2017. We are already increasing investments in our three ‘Ds’

to drive a five-year compounded annual oil growth rate of 12 to 14 percent, and I believe Anadarko is in a better position today to deliver value than at any time in my tenure with the company.”

SALES VOLUMES AND PROVED RESERVES

Anadarko’s full-year sales volumes of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) totaled 290 million BOE, or an average of 793,000 BOE per day. Fourth-quarter 2016 sales volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs averaged approximately 774,000 BOE per day.

In 2016, Anadarko organically added 300 million BOE of proved reserves before the effects of price revisions. Anadarko’s costs incurred were $5.63 billion, which includes $2.45 billion of acquisition costs. The company’s oil and natural gas exploration and development costs were $3.21 billion.(3) The company estimates its proved reserves at year-end 2016 totaled 1.72 billion BOE, with 77 percent of its reserves categorized as proved developed. At year-end 2016, Anadarko’s proved reserves were comprised of 57 percent liquids and 43 percent natural gas.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

In 2016, Anadarko reduced its capital investments by approximately 50 percent relative to 2015, excluding capital investments associated with Western Gas Partners, LP (NYSE: WES), yet delivered significant sales-volume increases in its two most attractive U.S. onshore operating areas – the Delaware and DJ basins. Sales volumes in the Delaware Basin averaged approximately 45,000 BOE per day, including an increase of 8,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD), representing a 50-percent increase over 2015. In the DJ Basin, sales volumes averaged 244,000 BOE per day – a 20,000-BOE per day increase over 2015. The company increased rig activity in both basins during the year, ending 2016 with nine operated rigs in the Delaware Basin and five operated rigs in the DJ Basin, compared to six rigs in the Delaware and two in the DJ in the first quarter of 2016. 

In December, Anadarko closed the acquisition of Freeport-McMoRan’s deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties for $1.8 billion net of purchase-price adjustments, providing the company with the largest number of floating production facilities in the Gulf and doubling its net sales volumes from the region to more than 160,000 BOE per day. Also in the Gulf, the company announced exploration success at the Warrior prospect, which is a likely tieback to the company’s Marco Polo facility. Anadarko expects to spud an appraisal well to Warrior in the second quarter of 2017. Additionally, a successful appraisal well was drilled at the Phobos discovery, which is being evaluated as a possible tieback to Anadarko’s Lucius facility. 

Internationally, Anadarko’s operations in Algeria continued to produce at their highest level since 2009, with gross production averaging 404,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the 

3

TEN project offshore Ghana, which achieved first oil in August, successfully ramped gross production to an average of approximately 54,000 BOPD in December.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Below are reconciliations of certain GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, each as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This non-GAAP information should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures. 

Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate operating and financial performance and believes the measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the impact of certain noncash and/or other items that management does not consider to be indicative of the Company’s performance from period to period. Management also believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors to evaluate and compare the Company’s operating and financial performance across periods, as well as facilitating comparisons to others in the Company’s industry.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures

Management believes oil and natural gas exploration and development costs is a more accurate reflection of the expenditures incurred during the current year excluding acquisition costs and certain obligations to be paid in future periods. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Includes capitalized asset retirement costs.

Management uses net debt to determine the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. Management believes that using net debt in the capitalization ratio is useful to investors in determining the Company’s leverage since the Company could choose to use its cash and cash equivalents to retire debt. In addition, management believes that presenting Anadarko’s net debt excluding WGP is useful because WGP is a separate public company with its own capital structure.

*Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP) is a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary of Anadarko and WES is a consolidated subsidiary of WGP.
