On February 22, 2017, Concho Resources Inc. (the “Company”) filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the “2016 Form 10-K”). At the time the Company filed its 2016 Form 10-K, the Company had received a manually signed consent (the “Consent”) from Grant Thornton LLP (“GT”), the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, pursuant to which GT consented to the incorporation by reference in the Company’s registration statements on Form S-3 and Form S-8, as set forth in the Consent, of its report, dated February 22, 2017, relating to the Company’s financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.  

The Company filed the Consent as Exhibit 23.1 to its 2016 Form 10-K; however, GT’s conformed electronic signature was inadvertently omitted. To correct this inadvertent omission, a copy of the consent, as originally filed, which includes GT’s conformed electronic signature, is attached as Exhibit 23 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
