Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On January 31, 2017, Mastercard Incorporated (“Mastercard”) issued a press release announcing financial results for its fourth quarter and full year 2016.

A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

In the attached press release, Mastercard discloses as non-GAAP financial measures, total operating expenses, operating income, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share (as well as related applicable growth rates versus the comparable period in the prior year), operating margin and effective tax rate that each exclude the impact of one or more of the following special items:

•in 2016 and 2015, Mastercard recorded provisions for litigations with merchants in the U.K.

•in 2015, Mastercard recorded a settlement charge relating to the termination of its qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plan in general and administrative expenses (the “U.S. Employee Pension Plan Settlement Charge“) 

The provisions for litigation for both years relate to separate merchant litigations in the U.K. Mastercard excluded these provisions because its management monitors material litigation judgments and settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. Mastercard also excluded the U.S. Employee Pension Plan Settlement Charge because its management monitors significant one-time items separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. Mastercard’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of Mastercard’s operating performance and meaningful comparison of its results between periods.

In the attached press release, management also presents growth rates on a currency-neutral basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on our operating results. The impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. Mastercard’s management believes the presentation of certain currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information. 

Mastercard’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. The attached press release includes reconciliations of the requisite non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Mastercard’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
