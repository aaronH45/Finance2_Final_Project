Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Results

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances decreased to $6.1 billion at the end of the December 2016 quarter compared to $7.5 billion at the end of the September 2016 quarter. This decrease was primarily the result of approximately $1.6 billion of cash payments for the settlement of debt, combined with approximately $37 million of capital expenditures; and approximately $48 million of dividends paid to stockholders, offset by $404 million in cash flows from operating activities during the December 2016 quarter.

Deferred revenue at the end of the December 2016 quarter decreased to $673 million as compared to $704 million at the end of the September 2016 quarter. Deferred profit at the end of the December 2016 quarter decreased to $408 million as compared to $418 million at the end of the September 2016 quarter. Lam’s deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The estimated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $129 million as of December 25, 2016 and $65 million as of September 25, 2016.
