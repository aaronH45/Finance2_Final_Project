 Item 8.01.Other Events.  

 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. is filing this report to provide preliminary financial and operating results for the fourth quarter 2016, as well as other recent developments.   

 Fourth Quarter 2016 Preliminary Results  

 For the fourth quarter 2016, we anticipate the following:  

   ·    Sales revenue of $1.035 billion 

   ·    Comparable restaurant sales decrease of 4.8% 

   ·    Restaurant level operating margin to be approximately 13% to 14% 

   ·    Pre-tax operating income to be approximately $30 million to $32 million 

   ·    Quarterly tax rate of 47% to 53%; full year effective tax rate of 39% to 45%  

   ·    Diluted earnings per share in the range of approximately $0.50 to $0.58

 Fourth Quarter 2016 Sales Trend Detail  

 ﻿  

 Comparable restaurant sales for the quarter decreased 4.8%, which includes the benefit of 0.5% related to previously deferred revenue that was recognized in the fourth quarter. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 20.2% in October 2016, decreased 1.4% in November 2016, and increased 14.7% in December 2016. Our sales comparisons are lapping an easier compare due to lower sales levels in November and December 2015.   

 ﻿  

 Fourth Quarter 2016 Operating Margin and Net Income  

 ﻿  

 We anticipate our restaurant-level operating margin for the fourth quarter 2016 to be in the 13% to 14% range. And we also expect pre-tax operating income of approximately $30 million to $32 million. During the quarter we incurred higher expenses compared to our originally-forecasted amounts in other operating costs, driven by increased promotional spend and costs related to testing television advertising. Our marketing and promotional expenses during the quarter totaled approximately 4.7% of sales. We also incurred higher food costs compared to our originally-forecasted amounts as a result of increased market costs for avocados.   

 ﻿  

 We anticipate reporting diluted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.58 per share. Final year-end accounting adjustments and related tax expenses may impact these estimates. We anticipate a higher annual effective tax rate for the full year 2016 of 39% to 45% due to higher state tax rates, not qualifying for the federal R&D tax credits in 2016, and non-deductible items on overall lower pre-tax operating income. The increase in our full year estimated tax rate has a magnified effect on our tax rate in the fourth quarter. We expect the 2017 effective tax rate to be lower than the 2016 effective tax rate.   

 ﻿  

 Additional Stock Repurchase Authorization  

 ﻿  

 This report is also filed to announce that Chipotle’s Board of Directors has authorized repurchases of Chipotle common stock with a total aggregate purchase price of $100 million, exclusive of commissions. This repurchase is in addition to previously announced repurchase authorizations totaling $2.1 billion. As of January 10, 2017, the current remaining authorization is $200.0 million. The Board’s authorization of the repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.

our possible inability to increase menu prices or realize the benefits of menu price increases; factors that could affect our ability to achieve and manage our planned expansion, such as the availability of a sufficient number of suitable new restaurant sites and the availability of qualified employees; the performance of new restaurants and their impact on existing restaurant sales; the risk of food-borne illnesses and other health concerns about our food or dining out generally; increases in the cost of food ingredients and other key supplies, or higher food costs due to new supply chain protocols; the potential for increased labor costs or difficulty retaining qualified employees, including as a result of market pressures, enhanced food safety procedures in our restaurants, or new regulatory requirements; risks relating to our expansion into new markets; the impact of federal, state or local government regulations relating to our employees, our restaurant design, or the sale of food or alcoholic beverages; risks associated with our Food With Integrity strategy, including supply shortages and potential liabilities from advertising claims and other marketing activities related to Food With Integrity; security risks associated with the acceptance of electronic payment cards or electronic storage and processing of confidential customer or employee information; risks relating to litigation, including possible governmental actions related to food-borne illness incidents, as well as class action litigation regarding employment laws, advertising claims or other matters; risks relating to our insurance coverage and self-insurance; risks arising from senior management changes, including our return to having a single CEO, as well as our dependence on key personnel; risks related to our marketing and advertising strategies, including risks related to our Chiptopia rewards program and other promotional activities; risks regarding our ability to protect our brand and reputation; risks associated with our ability to effectively manage our growth;  and other risk factors described from time to time in our SEC reports, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, all of which are available on our website at chipotle.com.
