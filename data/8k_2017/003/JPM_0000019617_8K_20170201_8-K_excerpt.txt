 Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On January 31, 2017, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and certain affiliates (“JPMorgan” or the “Firm”) entered into an agreement to settle all remaining lawsuits, claims, objections and other disputes brought by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and certain of its affiliates (“Lehman”) against JPMorgan, which were not already resolved in the January 25, 2016 settlement between JPMorgan and Lehman. (For additional information concerning the prior settlement, reference is made to the Firm’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 25, 2016.) The matters resolved by the current settlement include, among other things, (i) Lehman’s claims objection challenging JPMorgan’s disposition of securities collateral posted to JPMorgan in its roles as clearing bank for Lehman and as Lehman’s custodian for tri-party repurchase agreements; (ii) Lehman’s remaining claims against JPMorgan in an adversary proceeding related to certain payments claimed to be due to Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc.; and (iii) Lehman’s objections regarding JPMorgan’s securities lending claims and the sufficiency of documentation provided by JPMorgan for a number of other claims. Under the current settlement, the Firm will pay $797.5 million to Lehman.  

The Firm has previously reserved for this settlement. The settlement is subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, and a hearing on a motion to obtain such approval is currently scheduled for February 16, 2017.
