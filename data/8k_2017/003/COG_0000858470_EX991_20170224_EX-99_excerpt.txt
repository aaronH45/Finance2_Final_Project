Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Results, 

Reports Five Percent Proved Reserves Growth to 8.6 Tcfe, Provides Marcellus EUR Update

HOUSTON, February 24, 2017/PRNewswire/ -- Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) (“Cabot” or the “Company”) today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2016. 

Highlights 

•Equivalent production growth of four percent year-over-year

•Proved reserves growth of five percent year-over-year including proved developed reserves growth of 16 percent

•Total company all-sources finding and development costs of $0.37 per thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe) and Marcellus-only all-sources finding and development costs of $0.26 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf)

•Generated positive free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures) for the full-year

•Improved operating expenses per unit by eight percent and cash operating expenses per unit by 11 percent year-over-year

•Reduced outstanding debt by $497 million and ended the year with approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity 

•Increased Marcellus estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) per 1,000 feet of lateral to 4.4 billion cubic feet (Bcf) 

“Our 2016 performance demonstrates Cabot’s ability to deliver strong operational and financial results despite lower commodity prices for the majority of the year,” said Dan O. Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The Company delivered production and reserves growth while spending within operating cash flow during a year in which we realized record-low natural gas prices, highlighting Cabot’s world-class asset base and the consistent execution

by our employees.” Dinges added, “Based on our current outlook for 2017, we anticipate another year of production and reserves growth while generating positive free cash flow.”

Full-Year 2016 Financial Results

Equivalent production was 627.1 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) in 2016, consisting of 600.4 Bcf of natural gas, 4,013.1 thousand barrels (Mbbls) of crude oil and condensate, and 441.2 Mbbls of natural gas liquids (NGLs). 

Cash flow from operations was $392.4 million in 2016, compared to $740.7 million in 2015. Discretionary cash flow in 2016 was $460.7 million, compared to $699.1 million in 2015. Net loss in 2016 was $417.1 million, or $0.91 per share, compared to net loss of $113.9 million, or $0.28 per share, in 2015. Net loss for the year included the impact of a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $274.7 million associated with our oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets in West Virginia and Virginia. Excluding the effect of this impairment and other selected items (detailed in the table below), net loss was $97.4 million, or $0.21 per share, in 2016, compared to net income of $55.4 million, or $0.13 per share, in 2015. EBITDAX in 2016 was $554.4 million, compared to $815.2 million in 2015. Significant reductions in realized prices for both natural gas and oil were the primary drivers for the lower results during the year, partially offset by higher equivalent production and lower overall expenses. See the supplemental tables at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures including discretionary cash flow, net income (loss) excluding selected items, EBITDAX and net debt to adjusted capitalization ratio.

Natural gas price realizations, including the impact of derivatives, were $1.70 per Mcf in 2016, down 21 percent compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of derivatives, natural gas price realizations for 2016 implied a $0.76 discount to NYMEX settlement prices. Oil price realizations, including the impact of derivatives, were $37.30 per barrel (Bbl), down 18 percent compared to 2015. NGL price realizations were $11.74 per Bbl, down seven percent compared to 2015.

Operating expenses (including financing) decreased to $2.17 per Mcfe in 2016, an improvement of eight percent from $2.37 per Mcfe in 2015. Cash operating expenses (excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization; stock-based compensation; exploratory dry hole cost; and amortization of debt issuance costs) decreased to $1.16 per Mcfe in 2016, an 11 percent improvement over 2015. 

Cabot drilled 40 gross (38.0 net) wells and completed 76 gross (76.0 net) wells in 2016 and exited the year with 51 gross (45.2 net) drilled and uncompleted wells, of which 29 gross (26.2 net) were in the Marcellus Shale and 22 gross (19.0 net) were in the Eagle Ford Shale.

Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Results 

Equivalent production in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 164.2 Bcfe, consisting of 158.6 Bcf of natural gas, 822.7 Mbbls of crude oil and condensate, and 106.5 Mbbls of NGLs. Equivalent production increased nine percent sequentially compared to the third quarter of 2016 and was in line with the high-end of the Company’s guidance range for the quarter.

Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $139.7 million, compared to $155.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Discretionary cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $163.6 million, compared to $125.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $292.8 million, or $0.63 per share, compared to a net loss of $111.1 million, or $0.27 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the effect of the impairment and other selected items (detailed in the table below), net income was $5.1 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to net loss of $6.4 million, or $0.02 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2015. EBITDAX for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $187.4 million, compared to $164.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Natural gas price realizations, including the impact of derivatives, were $1.94 per Mcf both in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of derivatives, natural gas price realizations for the quarter were $1.96 per Mcf, representing a $1.02 discount to NYMEX settlement prices. Oil price realizations, including the impact of derivatives, were $42.94 per Bbl, up 14 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. NGL price realizations were $13.84 per Bbl, up 18 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. “Fourth quarter natural gas and crude oil price realizations excluding the impact of derivatives posted a sequential increase of 9 percent and 11 percent, respectively, when compared to the third quarter, highlighting the improving commodity price backdrop,” commented Dinges.

Operating expenses (including financing) decreased to $2.05 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter of 2016, an 11 percent improvement compared to $2.30 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter of 2015. Cash operating expenses (excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization; stock-based compensation; exploratory dry hole cost; and amortization of debt issuance costs) decreased to $1.11 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 12 percent improvement over the fourth quarter of 2015.

Cabot drilled 12 gross (10.0 net) wells and completed 25 gross (25.0 net) wells in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Year-End 2016 Financial Position and Liquidity

As of December 31, 2016, Cabot had total debt of $1.5 billion and cash on hand of $498.5 million. The Company's net debt to adjusted capitalization ratio and net debt to trailing twelve months EBITDAX ratio were 28.5 percent and 1.8x, respectively, compared to 50.1 percent and 2.5x as of December 31, 2015. 

Total commitments under the Company’s credit facility remain unchanged at $1.8 billion, with approximately $1.7 billion currently available to the Company. The Company currently has no debt outstanding under the credit facility, resulting in approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity.

Year-End 2016 Proved Reserves

Cabot reported year-end proved reserves of 8.6 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), an increase of five percent over year-end 2015. Specific highlights from the Company’s year-end reserve report include:

•Total company all-sources finding and development costs of $0.37 per Mcfe

3

•Marcellus-only all-sources finding and development costs of $0.26 per Mcf

•Total company all-sources reserve replacement of 168 percent

•Marcellus-only all-sources reserve replacement of 183 percent

“Despite our lowest level of capital spending since 2004, Cabot grew proved reserves and proved developed reserves by five percent and 16 percent, respectively, at record-low finding and development costs,” explained Dinges. “We expect a return to double-digit reserve growth in 2017 as the Company increases its capital spending in anticipation of new takeaway capacity out of the Marcellus Shale.”

The table below reconciles the components driving the 2016 reserve increase:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of December 31, 2016, 97 percent of Cabot’s year-end proved reserves were natural gas and 93 percent were located in the Marcellus Shale. Approximately 66 percent of the year-end proved reserves were classified as proved developed and 34 percent were classified as proved undeveloped (PUD), including six percent of drilled and uncompleted PUDs.

Total costs incurred during 2016 were $389.8 million, which included $359.5 million for development costs, $27.6 million for exploration costs, and $2.7 million for unproved property acquisition costs. 

The SEC prices used for reporting Cabot's year-end 2016 proved reserves, which have been adjusted for basis and quality differentials, were $1.74 per Mcf for natural gas and $37.54 per Bbl for crude oil, representing a 4 percent and 20 percent year-over-year decrease, respectively. Assuming the SEC prices, the pre-tax present value of future net cash flows discounted at 10% ("pre-tax PV-10") of the year-end 2016 proved reserves was $2.6 billion. Assuming future strip benchmark pricing as of December 31, 2016 for the first five years and held flat thereafter, adjusted for basis and quality differentials, the pre-tax PV-10 value was $5.2 billion, representing a 100 percent increase over the corresponding SEC pre-tax PV-10. 

Marcellus Shale Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) Update

Based on Cabot’s year-end reserve bookings for 21 producing Lower Marcellus wells that were completed with the Company’s fourth generation completion design, Cabot has increased its guidance for Lower Marcellus EUR per 1,000 feet of lateral from 3.8 Bcf to 4.4 Bcf. “The EURs for our fourth generation wells further highlight the peer-leading productivity from our Marcellus assets in the core of the dry gas window in Northeast Pennsylvania,” stated Dinges.

“Based on our current well design and current commodity prices, we believe our project-level economics in the Marcellus are unrivaled across North American resource plays; however, we continue to test new initiatives to further enhance our economics.”

2017 Derivative Position Update

For 2017, the Company has 51.7 Bcf of natural gas swaps at a weighted-average price of $3.23 per Mcf and 35.5 Bcf of natural gas collars at a weighted-average floor and ceiling price of $3.09 per Mcf and $3.43 per Mcf, respectively. Additionally, Cabot currently has 36 percent of its 2017 natural gas volumes under fixed-price physical contracts at a weighted-average price of $2.29 per Mcf.

The Company also has 1,825 Mbbls of crude oil collars at a weighted-average floor and ceiling price of $50.00 per Bbl and $56.39 per Bbl, respectively. 

First Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Guidance Update 

Cabot has provided first quarter 2017 net production guidance of 1,780 to 1,820 million cubic feet (Mmcf) per day for natural gas; 10,000 to 10,500 Bbls per day for crude oil and condensate; and 1,200 to 1,250 Bbls per day for NGLs. 

The Company has reiterated its 2017 production growth guidance range of 5 to 10 percent and initiated crude oil production growth guidance of 15 percent, which represents a substantial increase from the zero percent oil growth contained in the preliminary 2017 budget issued in October 2016. Based on the expectation for higher operating cash flow due to an improvement in the commodity price outlook, the Company is increasing its exploration and production (E&P) capital budget from $575 million to $650 million. This incremental capital will fund additional drilling and completion activity, primarily in the Eagle Ford. “Cabot has seen a significant improvement in project-level returns in our Eagle Ford asset due to increased productivity from enhanced completions, continued cost reductions, and higher crude oil prices,” said Dinges. “Accordingly, we plan to allocate additional capital to this asset to grow exit-to-exit crude oil volumes by 50 percent in 2017.” Dinges added, “Even with this modest increase in capital for 2017, we are forecasting approximately $250 million of positive free cash flow for the year based on recent strip prices.” 

Drilling, completion and facility capital will account for approximately 94 percent of the E&P budget, with approximately 67 percent allocated to the Marcellus Shale and 33 percent allocated to the Eagle Ford Shale. The Company expects to drill an additional 20 net wells (15 in the Eagle Ford and 5 in the Marcellus) for total of 90 net wells drilled in 2017. The Company plans to complete an additional 15 net wells (14 in the Eagle Ford and 1 in the Marcellus) for a total of 90 net wells completed in 2017. In addition, Cabot anticipates approximately $70 million of contributions to its equity pipeline investments resulting in total 2017 program spending of $720 million. The capital associated with the equity pipeline investments assumes a more favorable outlook on the construction timing for Atlantic Sunrise and assumes minimal capital for Constitution Pipeline in 2017; however, the amount of pipeline investments will ultimately be dependent on the regulatory approval processes and the corresponding impact on the timing of construction activities.
