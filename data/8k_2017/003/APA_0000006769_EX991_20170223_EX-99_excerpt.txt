HOUSTON, Feb. 23, 2017 – Apache Corporation (NYSE: APA) (Nasdaq: APA) today announced its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016.  

Apache reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $182 million or $0.48 per diluted common share during the fourth quarter 2016, including non-cash, after-tax impairments of $90 million. When adjusted for these and certain additional items that impact the comparability of results, Apache’s fourth-quarter loss totaled $22 million, or $0.06 per share. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in the fourth quarter was $819 million, and adjusted EBITDAX was $878 million.  

For the full year 2016, Apache reported a loss of $1.4 billion, or $3.71 per diluted common share. On an adjusted basis, Apache’s 2016 loss totaled $430 million, or $1.13 per share. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2.5 billion, and adjusted EBITDAX was $3.1 billion in 2016.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS AND ANNOUNCES 2017 CAPITAL PROGRAM  

 — PAGE 2 of 9  

John J. Christmann IV, Apache’s chief executive officer and president, said, “2016 was a very successful year and an important step in Apache’s transformation. We protected our balance sheet in a volatile price environment, remained focused on costs, and allocated our capital to high-return projects and strategic testing opportunities. This strategy resulted in an expanded economic drilling inventory, meaningful improvements in Permian Basin well performance, a more streamlined portfolio, and lower overhead and operating costs. We also discovered and announced the Alpine High, a sizeable new resource play in the Delaware Basin, which brings significant drilling inventory and puts Apache in one of the most exciting and competitive positions in the industry.  

“After two years of dramatic reductions to our capital program, our strategic objective has shifted in 2017 to delivering returns-focused growth. Accordingly, we are increasing our capital budget more than 60 percent this year over our 2016 spend, which will materially impact Apache’s production trajectory beginning mid-year. We are poised for excellent long-term organic growth through 2018 and beyond, which will be driven primarily by our high-quality acreage positions in the Delaware and Midland basins.”  

Capital budget outlook  

The company’s budgeted oil and gas capital investment for 2017 is $3.1 billion. This level of investment will exceed planned cash flow from operations, but given the depth of its attractive opportunities, Apache believes increased investment is strategically important for the year. Based on current strip pricing, the remaining outspend will be funded primarily by proceeds from non-core asset sales, more than $400 million of which were already received in the first quarter. Apache has also implemented a hedging program for 2017 oil production to protect cash flows from downside price risk.  

The majority of the budgeted 2017 capital investment, approximately 65 percent or $2 billion, is

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS AND ANNOUNCES 2017 CAPITAL PROGRAM

 being directed to growth opportunities in the Permian Basin, of which $500 million will be for infrastructure at Alpine High. Internationally, Apache will continue to invest at a level to sustain long-term free cash flow in Egypt and the North Sea. Capital investment in these two regions is expected to total approximately $900 million and will primarily focus on low-risk development and step-out exploration opportunities.  

Apache also provided a preliminary view into 2018 capital, with an expected budget for the year of $3.2 billion. Like 2017, the 2018 plan is expected to be heavily weighted toward investments in the Permian Basin.  

Production outlook  

While Apache is now investing at a level that will generate meaningful long-term growth rates, production will experience a brief decline before transitioning to a strong growth trajectory around mid-2017.  

During the first half of the year, the company anticipates production will decline as a result of scheduled downtime for the annual maintenance turnaround in the North Sea, scheduled downtime for plant maintenance in Canada, and natural declines as a result of reduced investment in lower-margin, North American Onshore regions during 2016. The North Sea annual turnaround, which usually takes place in the third quarter each year, has been scheduled for the second quarter 2017 to prepare facilities for first production from the Callater subsea tieback.  

“Once scheduled maintenance is behind us and the impact of our increased capital investment program begins to take hold, we anticipate our production volumes will steadily climb in the second half of the year when Alpine High sales volumes, increased Midland Basin activity, and the North Sea Callater development all come online. We are very confident that our portfolio is capable of delivering strong production growth and achieving the guidance we are providing today,” said Christmann.

Specifically, the company expects total company production to increase by approximately 10 percent annually from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2018. Total Midland and Delaware basin production is projected to grow at an annual rate of more than 50 percent over this same time period and drive the vast majority of Apache’s overall production increase. Oil production growth from the Midland and Delaware basins will also be very strong, with an expected annual rate of approximately 18 percent.  

Fourth-quarter operational summary  

During the fourth quarter, Apache operated an average of 18 rigs and drilled and completed 29 gross-operated wells worldwide. Highlights from Apache’s three principal areas include:  

   •   North America Onshore – Apache drilled and completed 17 gross-operated wells in North America Onshore during the fourth quarter and reported production of 252,000 Boe per day in the fourth quarter.  

In the Permian Basin, Apache operated an average of seven rigs and drilled and completed 17 gross-operated wells during the quarter, down from 29 wells drilled and completed in the third quarter. Production averaged 149,000 Boe per day.  

   •   During the quarter, Apache completed five wells at Alpine High. Delineation drilling confirmed an overpressured regime across the acreage position, a productive hydrocarbon column in the southern portion of the play, and productivity from the Pennsylvanian formation.  

   •   In addition to Alpine High, the company drilled and completed four gross-operated wells in other areas of the Delaware Basin, primarily targeting the Bone Springs formation.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS AND ANNOUNCES 2017 CAPITAL PROGRAM

   •   The company also drilled and completed eight gross-operated wells during the quarter in the Midland Basin, Northwest Shelf and Central Basin Platform.  

   •   North Sea – Production in the North Sea was 70,000 Boe per day, which was a 12-percent increase compared to the previous quarter. During the quarter, construction on the subsea tieback at Callater progressed on schedule for first production in the third quarter 2017.  

   •   Egypt – Gross production in Egypt declined slightly from the third quarter. On a net basis and excluding minority interest and tax barrels, Egypt production was down 7 percent sequentially from the third quarter to 90,000 Boe per day primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on the cost recovery mechanisms in production sharing contracts. During the quarter, Apache was awarded two concessions in November comprising 1.6 million acres, which are expected to be signed mid-2017.  

Portfolio activity  

During the fourth quarter of 2016, Apache entered into multiple transactions to sell certain noncore assets. These included a midstream infrastructure asset in the North Sea, which is expected to close later in 2017, and two smaller leasehold packages in the Midland and Delaware basins that were completed during the first quarter of 2017.  

Financial position and liquidity  

At year-end, the company had access to available liquidity of approximately $5 billion, including $1.4 billion in cash on hand and $3.5 billion in available borrowing capacity under its committed credit facility. The company’s credit facility matures in June 2020. Apache has reported debt of $8.5 billion as of Dec. 31, 2016 with no debt maturities before 2018 and only $700 million of debt maturing before 2021.

Year-end 2016 proved reserves  

Worldwide estimated proved reserves totaled 1.3 billion Boe at year-end 2016, down from 1.6 billion Boe at year-end 2015. This decline is almost entirely associated with production- and commodity-price related revisions. Changes in Apache’s reserves during the year consisted of the following: divestitures of 7 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe); production of 191 MMboe; and revisions of previous estimates of 159 MMboe. These decreases were partially offset by 103 MMboe of proved reserves added through net extensions and discoveries. Apache’s proved undeveloped reserves as a percentage of total proved reserves fell to 10.5 percent at year-end 2016 as a result of lower commodity prices and revised timing of development plans associated with reduced rates of capital expenditures. 2016 worldwide estimated reserves include limited contributions from Alpine High.

Cautionary note to investors  

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable, and possible reserves that meet the SEC’s definitions for such terms. Apache may use certain terms in this earnings release, such as “resources,” “potential resources,” “resource potential,” “estimated net reserves,” “recoverable reserves,” and other similar terms that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit Apache from including in filings with the SEC. Such terms do not take into account the certainty of resource recovery, which is contingent on exploration success, technical improvements in drilling access, commerciality and other factors, and are therefore not indicative of expected future resource recovery and should not be relied upon. Investors are urged to consider carefully the disclosure in Apache’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2015, (and Apache’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2016, when filed) available from Apache at www.apachecorp.com or by writing Apache at: 2000 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 100, Houston, TX 77056 (Attn: Corporate Secretary). You can also obtain this report from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(In millions, except per share data)  

Reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities to adjusted EBITDAX  

Management believes EBITDAX, or earnings before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense is a widely accepted financial indicator, and useful for investors, to assess a company’s ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to shareholders. We define adjusted EBITDAX, a non-GAAP financial measure, as EBITDAX adjusted for certain items presented in the accompanying reconciliation. Management uses adjusted EBITDAX to evaluate our ability to fund our capital expenditures, debt services and other operational requirements and to compare our results from period to period by eliminating the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be representative of the Company’s on-going operations. Management also believes adjusted EBITDAX facilitates investors and analysts in evaluating and comparing EBITDAX from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain operating expenses that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. However, our presentation of adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reconciliation of income attributable to common stock to adjusted earnings  

Our presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures because they exclude the effect of certain items included in Income Attributable to Common Stock. Management believes that adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share provides relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our management in assessing the Company’s operational trends and comparability of results to our peers.  

Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share to evaluate our operating and financial performance because it eliminates the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be representative of the Company’s on-going business operations. As a performance measure, adjusted earnings may be useful to investors in facilitating comparisons to others in the Company’s industry because certain items can vary substantially in the oil and gas industry from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of assets, capital structure and asset sales and other divestitures, among other factors. Management believes excluding these items facilitates investors and analysts in evaluating and comparing the underlying operating and financial performance of our business from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense and income items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. However, our presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(In millions)  

Reconciliation of debt to net debt  

Net debt, or outstanding debt obligations less cash and cash equivalents, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses net debt as a measure of the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reconciliation of costs incurred and GTP capital investments to Oil and Gas Capital Investment  

Management believes the presentation of oil and gas capital investments is useful for investors to assess Apache’s expenditures related to our oil and gas capital activity. We define oil and gas capital investments as costs incurred for oil and gas activities and GTP activities, adjusted to exclude asset retirement obligations revisions and liabilities incurred, while including amounts paid during the period for abandonment and decommissioning expenditures. Capital expenditures attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt are also excluded. Management believes this provides a more accurate reflection of Apache’s cash expenditures related to oil and gas capital activity and is consistent with how we plan our capital budget.
