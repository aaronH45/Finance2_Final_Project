First Quarter Results 

For the first quarter, the company reported net sales of $3.1 billion, with organic sales growth of 7 percent year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations (GAAP EPS) were $1.13 and adjusted EPS were $1.15, both record first quarter results for the company. Cash flow from continuing operating activities was $404 million, and free cash flow was $218 million. The company returned $234 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Excluding the company’s SubCom business, total orders were $3.1 billion, up 10 percent organically from the first quarter of 2016, and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.06. 

“We had a great start to the fiscal year,” said TE Connectivity Chairman and CEO Tom Lynch. “Organically, sales grew 7 percent over the prior year driven by double digit growth in our Automotive, Commercial Transportation and 

1 

Appliances business units; improvement in our Data and Devices business and strength in Asia. Our profitability reached a record in the quarter due to higher sales volume particularly in our harsh environment businesses, continued execution of the TE Operating Advantage and the benefit of previously enacted cost reductions. 

“We are raising our organic sales and EPS guidance for the full year, reflecting organic growth in all of our segments, continued benefits from our TE Operating Advantage program, and momentum in our acquired businesses. As I approach my upcoming transition from CEO to executive chairman in March, I’m proud of all we’ve accomplished and excited to have Terrence take the company forward to an even brighter future.” 

2017 Outlook 

For the fiscal second quarter 2017, the company expects net sales of $3.025 billion to $3.125 billion, reflecting an increase of 4 percent year over year at the midpoint. GAAP EPS are expected to be $0.97 to $1.01, including net restructuring, acquisition-related and other charges of $0.08. TE expects adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.09 which represents a 19 percent improvement at the mid-point versus the second quarter of 2016. 

For the full year, the company expects net sales of $12.2 to $12.6 billion, reflecting 3 percent actual and 4 percent organic growth at the mid-point versus the prior year, excluding the additional week in fiscal year 2016. GAAP EPS are expected to be $4.04 to $4.24 including restructuring, acquisition-related and other charges of $0.34 and a tax-related benefit of $0.08.

Non-GAAP Measures 

“Organic Net Sales Growth,” “Organic Net Sales Growth Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week,” “Net Sales Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week,” “Net Sales Growth Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week,” “Adjusted Operating Income,” “Adjusted Operating Income Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week,” “Adjusted Operating Margin Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week,” “Adjusted Operating Margin,” “Adjusted Other Income, Net,” “Adjusted Income Tax Expense,” “Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations,” “Adjusted Earnings Per Share,” “Adjusted Earnings Per Share Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week,” and “Free Cash Flow” are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP measures in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. The following provides additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures: 

3 

· Organic Net Sales Growth — is a useful measure of our underlying results and trends in the business. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and Organic Net Sales Growth consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures, if any. Organic Net Sales Growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that: i) are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; or ii) do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. 

· Organic Net Sales Growth Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week, Net Sales Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week, and Net Sales Growth Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week — represent Organic Net Sales Growth, net sales (the most comparable GAAP measure), and net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure), respectively, excluding the impact of the additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. The impact of the additional week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last month of the fiscal year. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they provide insight into our underlying operating results, trends, and the comparability of these results between periods. 

· Adjusted Operating Income — represents operating income (the most comparable GAAP measure) before special items including charges or income related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, and other income or charges, if any. We utilize Adjusted Operating Income to assess segment level core operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and underlying market conditions. It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. Adjusted Operating Income is useful to investors because it provides insight into our underlying operating results, trends, and the comparability of these results between periods. 

· Adjusted Operating Income Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week and Adjusted Operating Margin Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week — represents Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, respectively, excluding the impact of the additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they provide insight into our underlying operating results, trends, and the comparability of these results between periods. 

· Adjusted Operating Margin — represents operating margin (the most comparable GAAP measure) before special items including charges or income related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, and other income or charges, if any. We present Adjusted Operating Margin before special items to give investors a perspective on the underlying business results. This measure should be considered in conjunction with operating margin calculated using our GAAP results in order to understand the amounts, character and impact of adjustments to operating margin. 

· Adjusted Other Income, Net — represents other income, net (the most comparable GAAP measure) before special items including tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, if any. We present Adjusted Other Income, Net as we believe that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. 

· Adjusted Income Tax Expense — represents income tax expense (the most comparable GAAP measure) after adjusting for the tax effect of special items including charges related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, other income or charges, and certain significant special tax items, if any. We present Adjusted Income Tax Expense to provide investors further information regarding the tax effects of adjustments used in determining the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations (as defined below). 

4 

· Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations — represents income from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) before special items including charges or income related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, certain significant special tax items, other income or charges, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects. We present Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations as we believe that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations provides additional information regarding our underlying operating results, trends and the comparability of these results between periods. 

· Adjusted Earnings Per Share — represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) before special items, including charges or income related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, certain significant special tax items, other income or charges, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects. We present Adjusted Earnings Per Share because we believe that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. We believe such a measure provides insight into our underlying operating results, trends, and the comparability of these results between periods, since it excludes the impact of special items, which may recur, but tend to be irregular as to timing. It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. 

· Adjusted Earnings Per Share Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week — represents Adjusted Earnings Per Share excluding the impact of the additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. We believe Adjusted Earnings Per Share Excluding the Impact of the Additional Week is useful to investors because it provides insight into our underlying operating results, trends, and the comparability of these results between periods. 

· Free Cash Flow (FCF) — is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and Free Cash Flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations. 

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, if any, minus net capital expenditures. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters, and cash (collected) paid pursuant to collateral requirements related to cross currency swaps, are also excluded by management in evaluating Free Cash Flow. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. These items are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. 

In the calculation of Free Cash Flow, we subtract certain cash items that are ultimately within management’s and the Board of Directors’ discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. It should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of Free Cash Flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions that are not considered in the calculation of Free Cash Flow.
