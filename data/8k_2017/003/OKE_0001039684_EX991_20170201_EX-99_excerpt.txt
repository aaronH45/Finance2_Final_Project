“We expect 2017 to provide continued growth across our asset footprint as market fundamentals continue to improve and producer customers are increasing their activity in the NGL-rich shale plays where ONEOK is positioned,” said Terry K. Spencer, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. “ONEOK’s strong asset position, integrated operations and diverse basin footprint will continue to drive results and provide opportunities for growth. A lower cost of funding will enhance our ability to grow with our customers, which continues to provide a competitive advantage in today’s industry environment.  

“Lower breakeven economics are driving increased producer activity in the STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma, and the Williston and Permian basins, which is expected to benefit all three of our business segments,” continued Spencer. “We anticipate NGL volume growth over the coming year as six new third-party natural gas processing plants are connected to our natural gas liquids system and as we begin to see benefits from increased ethane recovery, with systemwide ethane rejection dropping to approximately 120,000 to 140,000 barrels per day in late 2017,” said Spencer. “Available NGL gathering capacity between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast also provides valuable service for producers in the STACK and SCOOP.  

“The natural gas gathering and processing segment is expected to benefit as producer activity continues ramping up on the more than 3.4 million acres we have dedicated across our footprint,” continued Spencer. “The segment has 300 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas processing capacity available to accommodate increased activity in the core of the Williston Basin and STACK play.  

“Increased drilling is also providing an exciting growth opportunity for our natural gas pipelines segment as producers pursue additional takeaway solutions for increased natural gas production,” said Spencer. “Our natural gas pipelines segment is well-positioned in the Delaware and Midland basins and the STACK and SCOOP plays to compete for the additional takeaway opportunities.

“With an expected lower cost of funding as a result of the proposed acquisition of ONEOK Partners and the approximately $9 billion of investments made over the past decade, ONEOK is in a position to fund a significant portion of its capital needs with retained cash flow, allowing us to be opportunistic when accessing the capital markets,” said Spencer.  

“ONEOK shareholders will benefit from an expected quarterly dividend increase following the close of the transaction, which is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2017, and from expected dividend growth of 9 to 11 percent annually,” continued Spencer. “By proactively combining our companies, we’re providing clear value to investors and positioning ONEOK to continue growing as one of the country’s premier midstream service providers.”

2017 COMMODITY PRICE ASSUMPTIONS:  

The average unhedged prices assumed in ONEOK’s 2017 guidance are 51 cents per gallon for composite natural gas liquids; $3.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) for NYMEX natural gas; and $45 per barrel for WTI-NYMEX crude oil.  

BUSINESS-SEGMENT GUIDANCE:  

Natural Gas Liquids Segment  

The natural gas liquids segment expects full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $1.11 billion to $1.31 billion.  

NGLs gathered are expected to average 800,000 to 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) and NGLs fractionated are expected to average 575,000 to 635,000 bpd in 2017.  

Volume growth in 2017 is expected to be driven primarily by a full-year volume benefit from the six new natural gas processing plants connected in 2016, including five third-party plants and ONEOK’s Bear Creek plant in the Williston Basin, and from increased drilling activity in NGL-rich shale plays, particularly the STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma and the Permian Basin.  

In 2017, the segment expects to connect to six additional third-party natural gas processing plants – one in the Rocky Mountain region, three in the Mid-Continent and two in the Permian Basin – increasing the partnership’s total third-party plant connections to more than 195.  

Ethane recovery remains a strong expected driver of volume growth in 2017. ONEOK continues to expect increased ethane recovery by its natural gas processing plant customers will begin in the second half of 2017 as world-scale petrochemical facilities begin operations and new export facilities increase capacity utilization, providing a greater impact on 2018 NGL volumes.

The segment’s fee-based earnings are expected to be approximately 90 percent in 2017.  

Natural Gas Pipelines Segment  

The natural gas pipelines segment expects full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $320 million to $340 million.  

Earnings in the segment are expected to remain more than 95 percent fee-based in 2017, with approximately 93 percent of its transportation capacity and more than 60 percent of its natural gas storage capacity contracted under firm fee-based (take-or-pay) commitments.  

In 2017, the segment is expected to benefit from a full year of operations on its Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline joint venture. The first phase of the pipeline, which added 170 MMcf/d of capacity, was completed in March 2016, and the second phase, which increased capacity to 570 MMcf/d, was completed in October 2016. The project is fully subscribed under 25-year firm fee-based (take-or-pay) commitments.  

The segment also is expected to benefit in 2017 from a full year of operations on its ONEOK WesTex Pipeline expansion, which increased capacity by 260 MMcf/d, and its Midwestern Gas Transmission expansion, which increased capacity by 170 MMcf/d. Both projects are fully subscribed under long-term, firm fee-based (take-or-pay) commitments.  

The 100 MMcf/d westbound expansion of the ONEOK Gas Transmission Pipeline out of the STACK play in Oklahoma will begin construction in 2017, with an expected completion in the second quarter of 2018. Ongoing discussions with producers could potentially increase the expansion volume.  

Increased drilling activity in the STACK and SCOOP plays and Permian Basin continue to drive discussions surrounding natural gas takeaway options out of these basins where ONEOK’s natural gas pipelines segment is already well-positioned.  

Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Segment  

The natural gas gathering and processing segment expects full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $445 million to $485 million.  

Natural gas processed is expected to average 1,400 to 1,550 MMcf/d and natural gas gathered is expected to average 1,500 to 1,650 MMcf/d in 2017.

Mid-Continent volumes are expected to increase throughout 2017 due to increased producer activity in the prolific STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma, where production results from ONEOK’s producer customers continue to improve. Volumes are expected to be weighted more towards the second half of 2017, as producers continue to move additional rigs into the area during the first half of the year. ONEOK has approximately 200,000 acres dedicated in the core of the STACK play and 100 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity available to accommodate volumes from increased drilling activity in the area.  

ONEOK’s Williston Basin volumes are expected to benefit from increased well completion activity, rigs moving back into the basin and the continued ramp up of projects completed in 2016, including the Bear Creek natural gas processing plant. The segment has approximately 3 million acres dedicated in the basin, including 1 million acres in the core, and 200 MMcf/d of available natural gas processing capacity on its system in the area. Approximately 300 drilled but uncompleted wells remain on ONEOK’s acreage dedications, which provide a backlog of volume growth opportunities in 2017 requiring minimal capital while rigs continue to increase throughout the year.  

The segment’s fee-based earnings are expected to be more than 75 percent in 2017.

ONEOK will conduct a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (7:30 a.m. Central Standard Time) on Feb. 1, 2017, to discuss the transaction and 2017 guidance. The call also will be carried live on ONEOK’s website.
