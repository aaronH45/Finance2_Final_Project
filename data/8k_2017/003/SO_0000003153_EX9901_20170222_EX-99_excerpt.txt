[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]NOTE: For more information regarding these non-GAAP adjustments, see the footnotes accompanying the Financial Highlights page of the earnings package.

Earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 were positively influenced by retail revenue effects at Southern Company’s traditional electric operating companies and weather-related revenue impacts, offset by increased operations and maintenance costs, increased share issuances and lower customer usage. Full year 2016 earnings were further positively influenced by continued success with renewable energy projects at wholesale subsidiary Southern Power. 

“2016 was a year of tremendous accomplishment for Southern Company,” said Chairman, President and CEO Thomas A. Fanning. “The acquisitions of Southern Company Gas, PowerSecure and a 50 percent equity interest in Southern Natural Gas have served to lengthen and strengthen our low-risk, customer-focused business model and are expected to further support our ability to deliver regular, predictable and sustainable long-term earnings and dividend growth.”

Fourth quarter 2016 operating revenues were $5.18 billion, compared with $3.57 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 45.2 percent. Southern Company Gas accounted for $1.11 billion of the increase in operating revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating revenues for the full year 2016 were $19.90 billion, compared with $17.49 billion for the same period in 2015, a 13.8 percent increase. Southern Company Gas accounted for $1.65 billion of the increase in operating revenues for the full year 2016.
