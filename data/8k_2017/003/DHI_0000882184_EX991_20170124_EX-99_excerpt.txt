D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), America’s Builder, today reported that net income for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 increased 31% to $206.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, from $157.7 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.

Net sales orders for the first quarter ended December 31, 2016 increased 15% to 9,241 homes and 17% in value to $2.8 billion compared to 8,064 homes and $2.4 billion in the prior year quarter. The Company’s cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders) for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 22% compared to 23% in the same quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company’s sales order backlog of homes under contract at December 31, 2016 increased 6% to 11,312 homes and 7% in value to $3.4 billion compared to 10,665 homes and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2015.

Homebuilding revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 20% to $2.8 billion from $2.4 billion in the same quarter of fiscal 2016. Homes closed in the quarter increased 17% to 9,404 homes compared to 8,061 homes in the prior year quarter. 

Pre-tax profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 improved 100 basis points to 11.0% from 10.0% in the same quarter of fiscal 2016. The improvement in pre-tax profit margin was driven primarily by a 70 basis point decrease in homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues.

Home sales gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 19.8%, compared to 19.9% in the prior year quarter and 20.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Gross margin decreased from the fourth quarter primarily due to higher warranty and litigation costs as a percentage of homebuilding revenues. In the current housing market, the Company continues to expect its average home sales gross margin to be around 20%, with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty, litigation and interest costs. Homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 9.5% compared to 10.2% in the prior year quarter. 

The Company ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of homebuilding unrestricted cash and homebuilding debt to total capital of 28.6%. Homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable divided by total equity plus homebuilding notes payable.

Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, “The D.R. Horton team produced strong results in our first quarter, highlighted by $318.1 million of pre-tax income on $2.9 billion of revenues. Our pre-tax profit margin improved 100 basis points from the prior year quarter to 11.0%, driven by improved SG&A leverage. The value of our net sales orders increased by 17%, and our home sales revenue increased by 20%.

“These results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams, diverse product offerings through our family of brands and good market conditions across our broad national footprint. We remain focused on growing our revenues and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate positive annual operating cash flows and improved returns. With 24,500 homes in inventory at the end of December and a robust supply of lots, we are well-positioned for the upcoming spring selling season and the remainder of fiscal 2017.” 

D.R. Horton reaffirms its previously issued fiscal 2017 guidance including a consolidated pre-tax profit margin of 11.2% to 11.5%, consolidated revenues of $13.4 billion to $13.8 billion, homes closed between 43,500 homes and 45,500 homes and cash flow from operations in the range of $300 million to $500 million. The Company’s fiscal 2017 results will be significantly impacted by the strength of the spring selling season, and the Company will update its expectations as necessary each quarter. 

The Company has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share. The dividend is payable on February 15, 2017 to stockholders of record on February 3, 2017.

The Company will host a conference call today (Tuesday, January 24th) at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The dial-in number is 877-407-8033, and the call will also be webcast from the Company’s website at investor.drhorton.com.
