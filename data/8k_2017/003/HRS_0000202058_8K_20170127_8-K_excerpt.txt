On January 27, 2017, Harris Corporation (“Harris” or the “Company”) issued a press release announcing that it signed a definitive agreement to sell its government IT services business to an affiliate of Veritas Capital for $690 million in cash. The transaction is subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close before the end of Harris' fiscal 2017. Harris intends to use the proceeds from the transaction to support its capital allocation strategy, including pension pre-funding and share repurchases. Harris expects the benefit from the use of cash proceeds and restructuring actions related to its pending divestiture of its government IT services business and its recently completed divestiture of its Harris CapRock Communications commercial business to result in net dilution for its fiscal 2018 in a range of $0.10 to $0.15 per diluted share. The full text of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
