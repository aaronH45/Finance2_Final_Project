 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Purchase, NY - January 31, 2017 - Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. The company reported net income of $933 million, an increase of 5%, or 4% on a currency-neutral basis and earnings per diluted share of $0.86, up 9%, or 7% on a currency-neutral basis, both versus the year-ago period. Excluding a special item in this quarter related to merchant litigation in the U.K., the company reported net income of $940 million, an increase of or 6%, or 5% on a currency neutral-basis, and earnings per diluted share of $0.86, up 9%, or 7% on a currency-neutral basis, both versus the same period in 2015.

“We’re pleased to have delivered strong results for the quarter and full year, driven by solid execution of our strategy and leveraging our differentiated service offerings,” said Ajay Banga, Mastercard president and CEO. “Our continued investments in digital, safety and security, data analytics, loyalty and processing position us well for future growth in our core business and new payment flows.”

Net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $2.8 billion, an increase of 9%, or 10% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the same period in 2015. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•An increase in cross-border volumes of 13%.

These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes. As of December 31, 2016, the company’s customers had issued 2.3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards.

Total operating expenses decreased 1% to $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and were flat on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the special item, total operating expenses decreased 2%, or 1% on a currency-neutral basis. The decrease reflects the impact of ongoing cost management activities offsetting our continued investments in strategic initiatives.

2As noted last quarter, the company no longer charges fees on domestic EEA co-badged volume due to EU regulations implemented in June 2016, and thus excludes that volume from its metrics. The impact on net revenue is de minimis (see page 11 for an explanation of adjusted growth rates). 

3The company is introducing a new name for what was previously referred to as “processed transactions.” The company will now refer to these as “switched transactions.” The methodology for calculating this metric has not changed and reflects the transaction counts that Mastercard has authorized, cleared or settled.

Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 23%, or 22% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the year-ago period. Excluding the special item, operating income increased 24%, or 23% on a currency-neutral basis. The company delivered an operating margin of 49.4%, or 49.8% excluding the special item. 

Mastercard reported other expense of $52 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, versus $82 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was mainly due to lower impairment charges on investments in the current quarter versus the comparable period in the prior year, partially offset by increased interest expense related to the company’s recent debt offerings.

Mastercard’s effective tax rate was 28.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, or 28.7% excluding the special item, versus a rate of 13.1% in the comparable period in 2015. The difference was primarily due to the recognition of discrete benefits in the fourth quarter of 2015.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, Mastercard repurchased approximately 11 million shares at a cost of $1.1 billion. Quarter-to-date through January 26, the company repurchased an additional 2.3 million shares at a cost of $247 million, which leaves $4.7 billion remaining under current repurchase program authorizations.

Full-Year 2016 Results

For the full-year 2016, Mastercard reported net income of $4.1 billion, an increase of 7%, or 8% on a currency-neutral basis, and earnings per diluted share of $3.69, up 10%, or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the year-ago period. Excluding special items, net income was $4.1 billion, up 6%, or 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Earnings per diluted share were $3.77, up 10%, or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, compared to the same period in 2015. 

Net revenue for the full-year 2016 was $10.8 billion, an increase of 11%, or 13% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the same period in 2015. Contributing to this growth were switched transactions growth of 16%, cross-border volume growth of 12% and gross dollar volume growth of 11%, on a local currency basis and adjusting for the impact of recent EU regulatory changes. These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives.

Total operating expenses were $5.0 billion, an increase of 9%, or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, for the full-year 2016, compared to full-year 2015. Excluding special items, total operating expenses were $4.9 billion, an increase of 10%, or 12% on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was primarily due to continued investments to support strategic initiatives, lapping of the favorable impact of foreign exchange gains in 2015 and higher data processing expenses. 

Operating income for the full-year 2016 was $5.8 billion, an increase of 13%, or 15% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the same period in 2015. Excluding special items, operating income was $5.9 billion, an increase of 13%, or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the same period in 2015. The company delivered an operating margin of 53.5%, or 54.5% excluding special items.

Mastercard’s effective tax rate was 28.1% for the full-year 2016, versus a rate of 23.2% in 2015. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 28.1% for the full-year 2016, versus a rate of 23.4% in the comparable period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of larger discrete tax benefits in 2015.

Footnote

The tables set forth the gross dollar volume (“GDV”), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards on a regional and global basis for Mastercard™-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.

Debit transactions on Maestro® and Cirrus®-branded cards and transactions involving brands other than Mastercard are not included in the preceding tables.

For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are Mastercard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them.

The Mastercard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Mastercard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving Mastercard-branded cards that are not switched by Mastercard and transactions for which Mastercard does not earn significant revenues.

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.

The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard’s transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by Mastercard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard’s customers subsequent to the date of its release.

Performance information for prior periods can be found in the “Investor Relations” section of the Mastercard website at www.mastercard.com/investor.
