Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On January 27, 2017, the Board of Directors of YUM! Brands, Inc. (“YUM” or the “Company”) approved a change in its fiscal year from a year ending on the last Saturday of December to a year beginning on January 1 and ending December 31 of each year, commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. In connection with the new fiscal year, the Company will move from a 52-week periodic fiscal calendar with three 12-week interim quarters and a 16-week fourth quarter that requires adding a 53rd week every five or six years, to a monthly reporting calendar with each quarter comprised of three months. Our U.S. subsidiaries will continue to report under 52-week fiscal calendars ending in late December that include three 12-week interim quarters and a 16-week fourth quarter that requires a 53rd week added every five or six years. 

The change in the Company’s fiscal year was made primarily to accommodate the removal of reporting lags from our international subsidiary fiscal calendars, which will significantly improve the alignment of our global reporting calendars. As a result of removing these reporting lags each international subsidiary will now operate either on a monthly calendar consistent with the Company’s new calendar or on a periodic calendar consistent with our U.S. fiscal calendars.

The change to the Company’s fiscal year is effective in 2017 and does not impact the Company’s results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. However, we will restate previously issued financial statements when presenting financial statements under our new calendar in 2017. Because the new 2017 fiscal year commences with the end of our 2016 fiscal year, there is no transition period in connection with the change in the fiscal year.
