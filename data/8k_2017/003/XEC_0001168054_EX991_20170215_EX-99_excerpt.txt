Cimarex Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Results 

- Total company production averaged 960 MMcfe per day in the fourth quarter 

- Reserves essentially flat with 2015 and Cimarex replaced 128% of production

DENVER, Feb. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE: XEC) today reported fourth quarter 2016 net income of $38.2 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2015 net loss of $630.5 million, or $6.78 per share(1). Adjusted fourth quarter net income (non-GAAP) was $56.7 million, or $0.60 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss (non-GAAP) of $23.0 million, or $0.25 per share(1). Cash flow from operations was $169.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $115.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) totaled $218.7 million in the fourth quarter, a 74 percent increase from 2015 levels(1). 

For the year, Cimarex recorded a net loss of $431.0 million, or $4.62 per share. The adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the full year was $0.70 per share(1). Cash flow from operations totaled $599.2 million in 2016 compared to $691.5 million in 2015. Adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) totaled $629.1 million in 2016, a 15 percent drop from 2015 levels(1). Revenues in 2016 totaled $1.3 billion, a 13 percent decrease from 2015. The decrease in revenues and cash flow was the result of lower production and lower product prices received. (See table of Average Realized Price by Region below.)

Total company production volumes averaged 960 million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) per day in the fourth quarter, down three percent from a year ago and within company guidance. For the full year, Cimarex reported daily production volumes of 963 MMcfe per day, down two percent from our 2015 average daily output of 985 MMcfe per day and within guidance.

Cimarex invested $735 million in exploration and development in 2016. This was down 16 percent from the $877 million Cimarex invested in 2015. Investments made in 2016 were funded with cash flow and cash on hand.

Proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 2.9 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), essentially flat with reserves reported a year ago. Proved developed reserves increased five percent to 2.3 Tcfe. Cimarex added 324.0 Bcfe through extensions and discoveries and 126.2 Bcfe through net performance revisions resulting in reserve replacement of 128 percent of 2016 production. Proved reserves are 79 percent proved developed. (See table of Proved Reserves below.)

Volatility in oil and natural gas prices had an impact on the company's financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, Cimarex benefited from higher prices relative to the same period a year ago. Realized oil prices averaged $44.67 per barrel, 20 percent higher than the same period a year ago. Natural gas prices were also up in the fourth quarter and averaged $2.86 per Mcf versus $2.20 a year ago. NGL prices were particularly strong in the fourth quarter averaging $18.15 per barrel up 43 percent from fourth quarter 2015. For the full year, however, realized oil prices averaged $38.30, down 12 percent from 2015. Natural gas prices averaged $2.31 per Mcf and NGL prices averaged $14.05 per barrel compared to $2.53 and $13.75, respectively, in 2015. 

Total debt at December 31, 2016 consisted of $1.5 billion of long-term notes, with $750 million maturing in 2022 and $750 million maturing in 2024. Cimarex had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility and had a cash balance of $653 million. Debt was 39 percent of total capitalization (non-GAAP)(2). 

Operations Update

Permian Basin 

Production from the Permian Basin averaged 511 MMcfe per day in the fourth quarter, a two percent decrease over fourth-quarter 2015 and a decrease of one percent sequentially. Quarterly oil volumes averaged 36,253 barrels per day, down six percent year-over-year and flat sequentially. 

Cimarex completed and brought on production 11 gross (eight net) Permian Basin wells during the fourth quarter, bringing the total for 2016 to 48 gross (30 net) wells. 

In Culberson County, Texas, Cimarex has completed 42 long lateral Wolfcamp wells to date including 21 in the Lower Wolfcamp and 21 in the Upper Wolfcamp. One highlight of the 2016 Permian program was the drilling and completion of five 10,000-foot lateral Upper Wolfcamp wells in Culberson County using upsized completions. These wells had an average 30-day peak initial production of 2,077 BOE per day (56 percent oil, 27 percent gas, 17 percent NGL). 

Mid-Continent 

Cimarex drilled and completed 105 gross (31 net) wells in the Mid-Continent area in 2016. The majority of the activity was in the Woodford and Meramec shale plays in western Oklahoma. At the end of the fourth quarter, 70 gross (12 net) wells were awaiting completion, including 28 gross (eight net) wells associated with the multi-well infill in the East Cana Core area. Mid-Continent production averaged 446 MMcfe per day for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 457 MMcfe per day for the full year.

This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding projected results and future events. Please refer to the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, to be filed with the SEC, for a list of certain risk factors that may affect these forward-looking statements.

Actual results may differ materially from company projections and other forward-looking statements and can be affected by a variety of factors outside the control of the company including among other things: oil, NGL and natural gas price levels and volatility; higher than expected costs and expenses, including the availability and cost of services and materials; compliance with environmental and other regulations; risks associated with operating in one major geographic area; environmental liabilities; the ability to receive drilling and other permits and rights-of-way in a timely manner; development drilling and testing results; declines in the values of our oil and gas properties resulting in impairments; the potential for production decline rates to be greater than expected; performance of acquired properties and newly drilled wells; costs and availability of third party facilities for gathering, processing, refining and transportation; regulatory approvals, including regulatory restrictions on federal lands; legislative or regulatory changes, including initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing, emissions and disposal of produced water; unexpected future capital expenditures; economic and competitive conditions; the ability to obtain industry partners to jointly explore certain prospects, and the willingness and ability of those partners to meet capital obligations when requested; changes in estimates of proved reserves; derivative and hedging activities; the success of the company's risk management activities; title to properties; litigation; the ability to complete property sales or other transactions; and other factors discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC. Cimarex Energy Co. encourages readers to consider the risks and uncertainties associated with projections and other forward-looking statements. In addition, the company assumes no obligation to publicly revise or update any forward-looking statements based on future events or circumstances. 

(1)Adjusted net income and adjusted cash flow from operations are non-GAAP financial measures. See below for a reconciliation of the GAAP measure to the non-GAAP measure.

(2)Reconciliation of debt to total capitalization, which is a non-GAAP measure, is: long-term debt of $1.5 billion divided by long-term debt of $1.5 billion plus stockholders' equity of $2.3 billion. Management uses this non-GAAP measure as an indicator of the financial condition of the company and believes professional research analysts and rating agencies use this measure for similar purposes.

(3)PEPL refers to Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Tex/OK Mid-Continent index and El Paso Perm is El Paso Permian Basin index both as quoted in Platt's Inside FERC.

(4)WTI refers to West Texas Intermediate oil price as quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share excludes the noted items because management believes these items affect the comparability of operating results. The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP earnings because:

 a) Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the company's financial performance between periods and to compare the company's performance to other oil and gas exploration and production companies.

 b) Adjusted net income (loss) is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by research analysts.

*Earnings (loss) per share are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.

**The tax impact of the 2016 periods is calculated using a tax rate that excludes the effects of tax adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter primarily related to the revision of previous tax balances. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Management uses the non-GAAP measure of adjusted cash flow from operations as a means of measuring the company's ability to fund its capital program and dividends, without fluctuations caused by changes in current assets and liabilities, which are included in the GAAP measure of cash flow from operating activities. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors for the same reasons, and that it is also used by professional research analysts in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

** Pre-tax PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is comparable to the standardized measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure but without deducting future income taxes. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Cimarex's discounted future income taxes were $229.3 million and $344.9 million, respectively. Cimarex's standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $1,892.6 million at year-end 2016 and $1,934.1 million at year-end 2015. Management uses pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of the company's proved reserves and to compare relative values of proved reserves to other exploration and production companies without regard to income taxes. Management believes pre-tax PV-10 is a useful measure for comparison of proved reserve values among companies because, unlike standardized measure, it excludes future income taxes that often depend on the unique income tax characteristics of the owner of the reserves rather than on the nature, location and quality of the reserves themselves. Management further believes that professional research analysts and rating agencies use pre-tax PV-10 in similar ways. However, pre-tax PV-10 is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Cimarex's pre-tax PV-10 and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of its oil and natural gas reserves.
