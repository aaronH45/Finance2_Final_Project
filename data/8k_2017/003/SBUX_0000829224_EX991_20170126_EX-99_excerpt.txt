First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Summary

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Consolidated net revenues were $5.7 billion in Q1 FY17, an increase of 7% over Q1 FY16. The increase was primarily driven by incremental revenues from the opening of 2,163 net new stores over the past 12 months and 3% growth in global comparable store sales.

Consolidated operating income grew 7% to $1,132.6 million in Q1 FY17, up from $1,058.0 million in Q1 FY16. Consolidated operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 19.8% primarily due to sales leverage and lower commodity costs, mainly coffee. The increase was partially offset by higher investments in our store partners (employees), primarily in the Americas segment. 

Q1 Americas Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net revenues for the Americas segment were $4.0 billion in Q1 FY17, an increase of 7% over Q1 FY16. The increase was driven by incremental revenues from 884 net new store openings over the past 12 months and 3% growth in comparable store sales.

Operating income of $958.5 million in Q1 FY17 grew 3% versus $934.6 million in Q1 FY16. Operating margin of 24.0% declined 110 basis points primarily due to higher investments in our store partners (employees), partially offset by sales leverage.

Q1 China/Asia Pacific Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net revenues for the China/Asia Pacific segment grew 18% over Q1 FY16 to $770.8 million in Q1 FY17. The increase was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 1,003 net new store openings over the past 12 months, 5% growth in comparable store sales, and favorable foreign currency translation. 

Q1 FY17 operating income of $163.4 million grew 29% over Q1 FY16 operating income of $127.1 million. Operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 21.2% primarily due to changes in certain business tax structures in China and higher income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.

Q1 EMEA Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net revenues for the EMEA segment were $262.4 million in Q1 FY17, a 16% decrease versus Q1 FY16. The decrease was primarily driven by the shift to more licensed stores in the region, including the absence of revenue related to the sale of our Germany retail operations in Q3 FY16, as well as unfavorable foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting the decrease were incremental revenues from the opening of 489 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months.

Operating income decreased 8% to $44.1 million in Q1 FY17, down from $48.1 million in Q1 FY16. Operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 16.8% primarily due to sales leverage driven by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores. Partially offsetting the margin expansion was unfavorable foreign currency exchange and sales deleverage in certain company-operated stores.

Q1 Channel Development Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net revenues for the Channel Development segment grew 8% over Q1 FY16 to $553.7 million in Q1 FY17, primarily driven by increased sales of premium single-serve and packaged coffee products. Increased international and foodservice sales also contributed.

Operating income of $242.9 million in Q1 FY17 increased 26% compared to Q1 FY16. Operating margin expanded 620 basis points to 43.9%, primarily driven by lower coffee costs, higher income from the North American Coffee Partnership, and leverage on cost of sales and other operating expenses.

Non-GAAP Disclosure

In addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS exclude the below listed items. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS are operating income, operating margin and diluted net earnings per share, respectively.

Non-GAAP ExclusionRationale

Starbucks Japan acquisition-related itemsManagement excludes Starbucks Japan acquisition-related transaction costs as these items do not reflect expected future expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. In addition, management excludes Starbucks Japan integration costs and amortization of the acquired intangible assets when evaluating the performance because these expenses are not representative of our core business operations. Although these items will affect earnings per share beyond the current fiscal year, the majority of these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time. More specifically, integration costs are expected to be concentrated in the first several years post-acquisition. Additionally, the amounts of the acquired intangible assets are specific to the transaction, and the related future amortization was fixed at the time of acquisition and generally cannot subsequently be changed or influenced by management. 

Sale of Germany retail operationsManagement excludes the gain on sale of the Germany retail operations and related costs as these items do not reflect future gains, losses, costs or tax benefits and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's past or future operating performance.

Other tax mattersManagement excludes incremental tax benefits in the U.S. as these tax benefits do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's past or future operating performance.

Impact of the extra week in FY16Management excludes the impact of the extra week in full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP earnings per share because it is not a regular occurrence in the company's fiscal calendar, and this exclusion provides a more relative non-GAAP EPS comparison of the company's 2016 performance when compared to full year projected fiscal 2017 performance, which will not have an extra week. 

Non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
