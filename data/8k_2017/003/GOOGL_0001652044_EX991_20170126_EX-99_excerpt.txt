About non-GAAP financial measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, free cash flow, non-GAAP constant currency revenues, and non-GAAP constant currency revenue growth. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 

We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the impact for foreign currency fluctuations or our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as SBC expense, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical 

performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.

For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations to the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow," and "Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues" included at the end of this release.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations to the nearest comparable GAAP measures

The following table presents certain non-GAAP consolidated results before certain items (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts, unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. We define non-GAAP operating income as income from operations excluding expenses related to SBC, and, as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of SBC expense, and as applicable, other special items so that Alphabet's management and investors can compare Alphabet's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. For purposes of determining non-GAAP operating income, we define SBC as awards accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 718 that we expect to settle in stock. SBC expense does not include expenses related to awards that we expect to ultimately settle in cash. Alphabet's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes SBC expense allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Alphabet's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Alphabet's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Alphabet's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, SBC expense, that are recurring. SBC expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Alphabet's business. Second, SBC is an important part of our employees' compensation. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS. We define non-GAAP net income as net income excluding SBC expense, net of the SBC related tax benefits, and, as applicable, other special items less the related tax effects. The tax effects of such items are calculated based on the tax deductible portion related to SBC and, as applicable, other special items, and applying the entity-specific, U.S. federal and blended state tax rates. We define non-GAAP diluted EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by total weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors for the same reasons that Alphabet uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS the SBC related tax benefits, and, as applicable, the tax effects of other special items. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Alphabet's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS together with net income and diluted EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions, unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology assets and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Alphabet is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it reflects the cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K. Alphabet has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues (in millions, unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP constant currency revenues and growth. We define non-GAAP constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter bases. Non-GAAP constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging gains recognized in the current quarter. Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current quarter revenues over prior period revenues, where current quarter international revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods. We consider non-GAAP constant currency revenues and growth as useful metrics as they facilitate management's internal comparison to our historical performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.

Segment results

The following tables present our revenues, operating income (loss), stock-based compensation, capital expenditures, and depreciation, amortization, and impairment by segment (in millions, unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Reconciling items are primarily related to corporate administrative costs and other miscellaneous items that are not allocated to individual segments.

(2) For purposes of segment reporting, we define SBC as awards accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 718 that we expect to settle in stock. SBC for segment reporting does not include expenses related to awards that we expect to ultimately settle in cash.

(3) Reconciling items are related to timing differences of payments as segment capital expenditures are on accrual basis while total capital expenditures shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are on cash basis and other miscellaneous differences.
