PACCAR Achieves Very Good Annual Revenues and Profits  

Increased Market Share and Strong European Truck Market Drive Results  

January 31, 2017, Bellevue, Washington – “PACCAR reported very good annual revenues and profitability in 2016. PACCAR achieved its 78th consecutive year of net income,” said Ron Armstrong, chief executive officer. “PACCAR’s financial results reflect the company’s premium-quality products and services, increased European truck deliveries, higher truck market share, and good aftermarket parts and PACCAR Financial Services results. I am very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered outstanding products and services to our customers.”

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION  

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

This earnings release includes “adjusted net income (non-GAAP)” and “adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP)”, which are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), since they exclude the non-recurring European Commission charge. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  

Management utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding a significant non-recurring charge that is not representative of underlying operating trends.  

Reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) are as follows:
