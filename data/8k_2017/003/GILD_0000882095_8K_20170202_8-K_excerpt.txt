The number of shares actually granted will be based on the fair value on the February 2, 2017 effective date. The independent members of the Board ratified the equity grants to Dr. Milligan. The options will be granted under the Company’s 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the Plan), and will have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 2, 2017. The options will have a maximum term of ten years measured from such effective date. The performance share awards will be issued under the Plan and will have both a total shareholder return (TSR) tranche equal to 50% of the grant-date fair value of the award and a revenue tranche equal to the remaining 50% of such grant-date fair value and divided into three separate annual revenue subtranches. The TSR and revenue tranches of each award will be structured in substantially the same manner as the 2016 performance shares awards.
