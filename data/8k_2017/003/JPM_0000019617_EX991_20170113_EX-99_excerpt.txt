Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, commented on the financial results: “Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year, reflecting our intense client focus and solid performance across our businesses. In the Consumer business, we had double digit growth in deposits and core loan balances, our credit card sales volume was a record, and for the year we had over $1 trillion of merchant processing volume. We saw continued momentum from the third quarter in CIB with strong Markets results across products. Asset Management and Commercial Banking both grew loans and deposits nicely in a competitive environment.”

Dimon added: “2016 demonstrated the strength and depth of our platform with record net income and EPS in an increasingly complex global environment. We grew market share in virtually all of our businesses and showed expense discipline while continuing to invest for the future. Building upon our strong new product offerings, we continue to deepen relationships with U.S. households and continue to achieve high customer satisfaction scores.”

Dimon concluded: “The U.S. economy may be building momentum. Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities, and we are well-positioned to play our part. Business plays a critical positive role in society, and in collaboration with nonprofits, governments and educational institutions, it can help strengthen our economy and our country. I am extremely proud of our Firm - we earn our stripes every day by doing a great job for clients and communities.”

JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $6.7 billion, an increase of 24%. 

Net revenue was $24.3 billion, up 2%. Net interest income was $12.1 billion, up 5%, primarily driven by loan growth and the net impact of higher rates, partially offset by lower investment securities balances. Noninterest revenue was $12.3 billion, flat compared with the prior-year quarter.

Noninterest expense was $13.8 billion, down 3%, primarily driven by lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was $864 million, down from $1.3 billion, due to net reserve releases in the current quarter of approximately $400 million across Consumer and Wholesale, versus reserve increases in the prior-year quarter. The reserve releases reflected a decrease in Consumer reserves of approximately $250 million primarily driven by releases in Mortgage Banking, partially offset by increases in Card and Consumer & Business Banking. The Wholesale provision was a benefit, primarily driven by releases in the Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining portfolios.

Fourth-quarter results included a tax benefit of $475 million related to the utilization of certain deferred tax assets.

The current quarter included a release of $425 million in Mortgage Banking, driven by $275 million and $150 million in the purchased credit-impaired and non-credit-impaired portfolios, respectively, reflecting lower delinquencies and improvements in housing prices, as well as a release of $25 million in the Student loan portfolio. The reserve releases were partially offset by a build of $200 million, including $150 million in Card and $50 million in Business Banking driven by loan growth.

1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures:

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures

a.In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These non-GAAP financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.

b.Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation of common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.

c.Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense (an expense of $230 million in the fourth quarter of 2016). The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance.

Notes on key performance measures

d.Core loans represent loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. For further information on total loans and core loans, see pages 3, 12, 16, 19, 21 and 23 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.

e.Estimated as of December 31, 2016. Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, the CET1 ratio and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In capital rules, to which the Firm will be subject as of January 1, 2019, are each considered key regulatory capital measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Capital Management on pages 149-158 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and pages 67-73 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.
