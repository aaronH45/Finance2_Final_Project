Qorvo® (Nasdaq:QRVO), a leading provider of innovative RF solutions that connect the world, today announced financial results for the Company’s fiscal year 2017 third quarter, ended December 31, 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal year 2017 third quarter revenue increased 33.1% year-over-year and decreased 4.4% sequentially to $826.3 million. Gross margin was 37.6%, operating expenses were $249.2 million, operating income was $61.4 million, and net loss was $78.6 million, or a loss of $0.62 per share. 

On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 44.3%, operating expenses were $157.1 million, operating income was $208.7 million, or 25.3% of sales, and net income was $177.3 million, or diluted EPS of $1.35. Gross margin decreased year-over-year due primarily to product mix shift to low band PAD products. On a sequential basis, gross margin increased due primarily to improvements in yields of low band PAD-related products.

Bob Bruggeworth, president and chief executive officer of Qorvo, said, “In the December quarter, Qorvo grew 33% year-over-year while exceeding our operating margin target for the quarter. We supported the launch of marquee smartphones and leading China-based OEMs and delivered record revenue in IDP. We did this while qualifying leading technologies for top customer programs, introducing over 100 new products, and achieving key milestones on operational initiatives. I’m extremely proud of what the team delivered to position Qorvo for anticipated double-digit revenue growth in fiscal year 2018.

“Of note, we achieved a significant performance milestone in BAW filter resonator performance, and we are competing today on the most complex BAW-based product opportunities. We now expect sales of BAW-based products will increase from less than a third of Mobile Products revenue in fiscal year 2018 to approaching 40% in fiscal year 2019. 

“In the March quarter, we’re forecasting a greater than historical sequential decline as two of our leading customers in China and a tier-one customer in Korea delay flagship smartphone launches. In fiscal year 2018, we expect double-digit revenue growth, driven by continued broad-based growth in IDP and increasing demand for our mobile products, including multiplexers, diversity receive modules, WiFi, RF Fusion, and RF Flex. We are also forecasting year-over-year content gains in marquee smartphones driven by low-band PADs, envelope trackers and tuners.”

Financial Outlook

Qorvo currently believes the demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the March 2017 quarter:

•Quarterly revenue in the range of $610 million to $650 million

•Gross margin of approximately 46%

•A tax rate of approximately 8%

•Diluted EPS in the range of $0.70 to $0.90

1Excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition and integration related costs, intellectual property rights (IPR) litigation (settlement) costs, acquired inventory step-up and revaluation, non-cash deferred royalty revenue and equal and offsetting non-cash prepaid royalty amortization, start-up costs, restructuring and disposal costs, (gain) loss on assets, loss on investment, and an adjustment of income taxes.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release contains some or all of the following non-GAAP financial measures: (i) non-GAAP revenue, (ii) non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, (iii) non-GAAP operating income and operating margin, (iv) non-GAAP net income, (v) non-GAAP net income per diluted share, (vi) non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development; selling, general and administrative), (vii) free cash flow, (viii) EBITDA, (ix) non-GAAP return on invested capital (ROIC), and (x) net debt or positive net cash. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is either adjusted from GAAP results to exclude certain expenses or derived from multiple GAAP measures, which are outlined in the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables, attached, and the "Additional Selected Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” tables, attached.

In managing Qorvo's business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures. In developing and monitoring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing gross margin and operating margin. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures to assess whether research and development efforts are at an appropriate level, and when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. Also, we believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors and enable investors to analyze the results of operations in the same way as management. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain non-cash expenses and stock-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in Qorvo's underlying performance.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures offer an additional view of Qorvo's operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of Qorvo's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting Qorvo's business. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Our rationale for using these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as their impact on the presentation of Qorvo's operations, are outlined below:

Non-GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP revenue excludes non-cash deferred royalty revenue. We believe that the exclusion of this non-cash adjustment to revenue provides management and investors a more effective means of evaluating our historical and projected performance.

Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquired inventory step-up and revaluation, non-cash deferred royalty revenue, non-cash prepaid royalty amortization, and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that exclusion of these costs in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin gives management and investors a more effective means of evaluating Qorvo's historical performance and projected costs and the potential for realizing cost efficiencies. We believe that the majority of Qorvo's purchased intangibles are not relevant to analyzing current operations because they generally represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition, and thus are effectively part of transaction costs rather than ongoing costs of operating Qorvo's business. In this regard, we note that (i) once the intangibles are fully amortized, the intangibles will not be replaced with cash costs and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time, and (ii) although we set the amortization expense based on useful life of the various assets at the time of the transaction, we cannot influence the timing and amount of the future amortization expense recognition once the lives are established. Similarly, we believe that presentation of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the 

impact of stock-based compensation expense assists management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of Qorvo's ongoing operations because (i) the expenses are non-cash in nature, and (ii) although the size of the grants is within our control, the amount of expense varies depending on factors such as short-term fluctuations in stock price volatility and prevailing interest rates, which can be unrelated to the operational performance of Qorvo during the period in which the expense is incurred and generally are outside the control of management. Moreover, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to understand the impact of the expensing of stock-based compensation to Qorvo's gross profit and gross margins and other financial measures in comparison to both prior periods as well as to its competitors. We also believe that the adjustments to profit and margin related to non-cash deferred royalty revenue, non-cash prepaid royalty amortization, acquired inventory step-up and revaluation, restructuring and disposal costs and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore the exclusion of these items provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual revenue and actual costs required to generate revenues over time and gives management and investors a more effective means of evaluating our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses do not represent continuing cash expenditures and, as described above, we have little control over the timing and amount of the expenses in question.

Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquired inventory step-up and revaluation, restructuring and disposal costs, acquisition and integration related costs, intellectual property rights (IPR) litigation costs (settlement), loss (gain) on assets, start-up costs and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that presentation of a measure of operating income and operating margin that excludes amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that acquired inventory step-up and revaluation, restructuring and disposal costs, acquisition and integration related costs, IPR litigation costs (settlement), loss (gain) on assets, start-up costs and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and gives management and investors a more effective means of evaluating our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP operating income and operating margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.

Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquired inventory step-up and revaluation, restructuring and disposal costs, acquisition and integration related costs, IPR litigation costs (settlement), loss (gain) on assets, start-up costs, certain non-cash expenses, loss on investment and also reflect an adjustment of income taxes. The income tax adjustment primarily represents the use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards, deferred tax expense not affecting taxes payable, tax deductible stock-based compensation expense in excess of GAAP stock-based compensation expense, and non-cash expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions. We believe that presentation of measures of net income and net income per diluted share that exclude these items is useful to both management and investors for the reasons described above with respect to non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.

Non-GAAP research and development, marketing and selling and general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP research and development, marketing and selling and general and administrative expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, IPR litigation costs (settlement) and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that presentation of measures of these operating expenses that exclude amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both 

management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that acquisition and integration related costs and IPR litigation costs (settlement) do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and gives management and investors a more effective means of evaluating our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of these non-GAAP operating expenses has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.

Free cash flow. Qorvo defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities during the period minus property and equipment expenditures made during the period. We use free cash flow as a supplemental financial measure in our evaluation of liquidity and financial strength. Management believes that this measure is useful as an indicator of our ability to service our debt, meet other payment obligations and make strategic investments. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows.

EBITDA. Qorvo defines EBITDA as earnings before interest expense and interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and intangible amortization. Management believes that this measure is useful to evaluate our ongoing operations and as a general indicator of our operating cash flow (in conjunction with a cash flow statement which also includes among other items, changes in working capital and the effect of non-cash charges).

Non-GAAP ROIC. Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor by measuring the effectiveness of our operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. We use ROIC to track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Non-GAAP ROIC is calculated by dividing annualized non-GAAP operating income, net of an adjustment for income taxes (as described above), by average invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated by subtracting the average of the beginning balance and the ending balance of current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long-term debt and other short-term financings) from the average of the beginning balance and the ending balance of net accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, net property and equipment and a cash amount equal to seven days of quarterly revenue.

Net debt or positive net cash. Net debt or positive net cash is defined as unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments minus any borrowings under our credit facility and the principal balance of our senior unsecured notes. Management believes that net debt or positive net cash provides useful information regarding the level of Qorvo's indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.

Our earnings release contains forward-looking non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, income tax rate and diluted earnings per share. We provide these non-GAAP measures to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide them to investors on a historical basis. GAAP revenue is expected to reconcile within $1.0 million of the quarterly forecasted non-GAAP revenue. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of the remaining forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because due to variability and difficulty in making accurate projections for items such as stock-based compensation, integration related costs, restructuring charges and the provision for income taxes, we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measures without unreasonable effort. We believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.

Limitations of non-GAAP financial measures. The primary material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating 

income and operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, EBITDA, non-GAAP ROIC and net debt or positive net cash, as an analytical tool compared to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of gross profit and gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities are (i) they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry, and (ii) they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance, thus limiting their usefulness as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the corresponding GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our gross profit and gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, net income per diluted share and net cash provided by operating activities. We further compensate for the limitations of our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding GAAP measures more prominently.
