(e) Compensation Arrangements of Certain Officers 

 On February 16, 2017, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of the Gilead Sciences, Inc. (the Company) set the 2017 base salary for John C. Martin, Ph.D., the Company’s Executive Chairman at $1,160,000.

 On February 16, 2017, the Committee granted Dr. Martin stock options and performance share awards with an effective date of February 16, 2017 with grant-date fair values of $2,000,000 and $2,000,000, respectively. The number of shares actually granted will be based on the fair value on the February 16, 2017 effective date. The options will be granted under the Company’s 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the Plan), and will have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 16, 2017. The options will have a maximum term of ten years measured from such effective date. The performance share awards will be issued under the Plan and will have both a total shareholder return (TSR) tranche equal to 50% of the grant-date fair value of the award and a revenue tranche equal to the remaining 50% of such grant-date fair value and divided into three separate annual revenue subtranches. The TSR and revenue tranches of each award will be structured in substantially the same manner as the 2016 performance shares awards.
