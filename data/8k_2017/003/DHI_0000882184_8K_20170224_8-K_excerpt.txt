Item 1.01.Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

Effective February 24, 2017, DHI Mortgage Company, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership (“DHI Mortgage” or the “Seller”), and a subsidiary of D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association, as a buyer, and as administrative agent, (“U.S. Bank” or “Buyer” or “Administrative Agent”) and other buyers listed as a buyer (collectively, the "Buyers") hereto entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement (the “Fourth Amendment”). The Seller, the Buyers, and the Administrative Agent are parties to a Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement dated as of February 27, 2015, a First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement dated as of February 26, 2016, a Second Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement dated as of June 24, 2016, and a Third Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement dated as of September 23, 2016 (collectively, the “Amended Repurchase Facility”).

The Amended Repurchase Facility provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to Buyers against the transfer of funds by Buyers (thereby becoming purchased loans). The purchase transactions are based on the terms and conditions in the Amended Repurchase Facility and the ancillary or operative agreements attached thereto or referred to therein, including the Amended and Restated Custody Agreement, dated March 1, 2013, by and between DHI Mortgage and U.S. Bank.

The Fourth Amendment increases the maximum aggregate commitment amount to $600 million, with an accordion feature that could increase the maximum aggregate commitment amount to $1.0 billion, based on the Administrative Agent obtaining increased committed sums from existing Buyers or through the addition of new buyers. In addition, the maximum aggregate commitment amount is increased to $725 million for approximately 30 days at the end of Seller's first, second, and third fiscal quarters and to $800 million for approximately 45 days at Seller's fiscal year end. Amounts outstanding under the Amended Repurchase Facility are not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries that guarantee homebuilding debt.

The Fourth Amendment reduces the interest rate effectively paid by DHI Mortgage by 7.5 basis points (0.075%).

The Fourth Amendment changes the term of the Amended Repurchase Facility through the earlier of (i) February 23, 2018, or (ii) the date when the Buyers’ commitments are terminated pursuant to the Amended Repurchase Facility, by order of any governmental authority or by operation of law.

The Fourth Amendment is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
