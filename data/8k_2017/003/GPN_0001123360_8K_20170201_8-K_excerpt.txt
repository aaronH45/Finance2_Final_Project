Item 5.08. Shareholder Director Nominations

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Global Payments Inc. (the “Company”) has scheduled the Company’s 2017 annual meeting of shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) for May 3, 2017. The exact time and location of the Annual Meeting will be specified in the Company’s proxy statement for the Annual Meeting. As previously reported, the Board authorized a change in the Company’s fiscal year to a calendar year-end, following a seven-month transition period from June 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. As a result, the Annual Meeting is being accelerated to coincide with the new fiscal year end. Because the date of the Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before the anniversary of the date of the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, a new deadline has been set for submission of shareholder nominations for directors or other proposals. If a shareholder intends to submit a nomination for director or other proposal for consideration at the Annual Meeting, the Company must receive notice of the proposal by the close of business on February 11, 2017.
