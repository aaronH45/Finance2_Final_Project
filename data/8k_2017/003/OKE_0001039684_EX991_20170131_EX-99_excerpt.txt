TULSA, Okla. – Feb. 1, 2017 - ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) and ONEOK Partners, L.P. (NYSE: OKS) today announced a definitive agreement under which ONEOK will acquire all of the outstanding common units of ONEOK Partners it does not already own for $9.3 billion in ONEOK common stock.

 continue to operate as a leading diversified midstream service provider with an integrated 37,000-mile network of natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines, processing plants, fractionators and storage facilities located in the Williston Basin, Mid-Continent, Permian Basin, Midwest and Gulf Coast. Shareholders in ONEOK and unitholders of ONEOK Partners are expected to benefit from the larger size of the combined entity, significantly enhanced financial strength and a lower cost of funding for future growth.  

Upon completion of the transaction, ONEOK does not expect to pay cash income taxes through at least 2021.  

“This acquisition of the balance of ONEOK Partners underscores the strategic value we place on the business we have successfully built since we ventured into the midstream space nearly 20 years ago,” said Terry K. Spencer, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. “A broad asset footprint, stable cash flows and attractive growth prospects remain core to our long-term growth strategy. Through the acquisition of the 60 percent of the limited partner interests in ONEOK Partners that ONEOK does not already own, ONEOK becomes a standalone operating company with a lower cost of funding and stronger cash flow generation.  

“Shareholders of ONEOK are expected to benefit from an increased dividend and higher dividend growth rate,” said Spencer. “We also anticipate the transaction will provide ONEOK enhanced access to the broader capital markets to support and fund future growth to meet the needs of our customers.  

“The transaction will not impact our employees or their day-to-day responsibilities,” continued Spencer. “The merger of our companies will enhance future opportunities for our businesses and employees, allowing us to continue growing as one of North America’s largest midstream service providers.”  

CREDIT RATINGS  

ONEOK has reviewed the proposed transaction with the rating agencies and expects the combined entity to receive investment-grade credit ratings. ONEOK expects significant retained cash flow and earnings growth to continue its progress toward improved credit metrics.  

ADDITIONAL TRANSACTION TERMS AND DETAILS  

Under the terms of the merger agreement, ONEOK will acquire all of the 171.5 million outstanding units of ONEOK Partners it does not already own at a fixed exchange ratio of .985 ONEOK shares for each public unit of ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners units will no longer be publicly traded. In aggregate, ONEOK will issue 168.9 million shares in connection with the proposed transaction, representing approximately 44.5 percent of the total shares outstanding of the pro forma combined entity.

 ONEOK and ONEOK Partners will remain outstanding. ONEOK intends to execute cross-guarantees among and between the entities to be effective upon closing of the transaction in order to eliminate the structural subordination.

The ONEOK Partners Conflicts Committee recommended approval of the transaction to the board of directors of the general partner of ONEOK Partners.
