Item 2.02Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company implemented organizational changes to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. These organizational changes resulted in: (i) within the Enterprise Group segment, primarily, the transfer of the big data storage product group previously reported within the Servers business unit to the Storage business unit; the transfer of the Aruba services capabilities previously reported within the Networking business unit into the Technology Services business unit; the transfer of certain server technologies previously reported within the Servers business unit to the Networking business unit; and (ii) the transfer of the Communications and Media Solutions product group previously reported within the Enterprise Services segment to the Technology Services business unit within the Enterprise Group segment.

To provide improved visibility and comparability, the Company has reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented which has resulted in: (i) the transfer of net revenue from the big data storage product group previously reported within the Servers business unit to the Storage business unit; the transfer of net revenue from the Aruba services capabilities previously reported within the Networking business unit to the Technology Services business unit; the transfer of net revenue from certain server technologies previously reported within the Servers business unit to the Networking business unit; and (ii) the transfer of net revenue, related eliminations of intersegment revenues and operating profit related to the Communications and Media Solutions product group previously reported within the Enterprise Services segment to the Technology Services business unit within the Enterprise Group segment.

These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share. As a result of this change, the Company has released restated quarterly and full year segment financial results and statements of business unit revenue for fiscal 2016 and 2015, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. Exhibit 99.1 is furnished herewith and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
