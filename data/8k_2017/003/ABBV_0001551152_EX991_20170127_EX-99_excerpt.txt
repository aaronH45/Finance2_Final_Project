In the U.S., HUMIRA sales grew 23.5 percent in the quarter. Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 4.1 percent, excluding a 2.0 percent unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Strong sales growth was driven by continued momentum across all three major market categories — rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology.

· On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expense was 24.3 percent of net revenues. The adjusted SG&A expense was 23.9 percent of net revenues. 

· On a GAAP basis, research and development expense was 17.5 percent of net revenues. The adjusted R&D expense was 17.3 percent, reflecting funding actions supporting all stages of our pipeline. 

· On a GAAP basis, the operating margin in the fourth quarter was 34.7 percent. The adjusted operating margin was 39.8 percent.

Key Events from the Fourth Quarter 

· AbbVie announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved IMBRUVICA to treat patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), an indolent form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). There are currently no other approved treatments specifically indicated for patients with MZL. This approval marks the fifth unique type of blood cancer indication for IMBRUVICA. 

· AbbVie presented long-term follow-up data evaluating up to five years of IMBRUVICA use in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition. In this analysis, 89 percent of treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory patients with CLL/SLL, including those with high-risk disease, show a complete or partial response. Additionally, at the meeting, AbbVie presented encouraging efficacy and safety findings from a number of ongoing trials in NHL.

Key Events from the Fourth Quarter (continued) 

· AbbVie announced positive results from a registration-enabling Phase 2 study evaluating IMBRUVICA in patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD), a serious and debilitating complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplant, who failed prior systemic therapy. The study found IMBRUVICA demonstrated efficacy, sustained responses and reduced symptom severity, with an overall response rate of 67 percent. In 2016, the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Orphan Drug Designation for IMBRUVICA as a potential treatment for cGVHD after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy, and the company expects to submit its regulatory application in the first quarter of 2017. 

· AbbVie announced the European Commission has granted conditional marketing authorization for VENCLYXTO™ (venetoclax) monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor; and for the treatment of CLL in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor. In 2016, the U.S. FDA granted accelerated approval of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with CLL with 17p deletion who have received at least one prior therapy. Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. 

· AbbVie submitted a New Drug Application to the U.S. FDA for its investigational, pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free regimen of glecaprevir (ABT-493)/pibrentasvir (ABT-530) (G/P), being evaluated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). In Phase 3 clinical studies, eight weeks of therapy with G/P achieved high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates across all major genotypes (GT 1-6) in patients without cirrhosis, which represents the majority of HCV patients. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, high SVR rates were achieved after 12 weeks of therapy. High SVR rates were also achieved in patients with limited treatment options, such as those with severe chronic kidney disease. In historically difficult to treat populations, including those not cured by prior direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment regimens, high SVR rates were achieved with durations as short as 12 weeks. AbbVie received U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for its investigational regimen for the treatment of patients who failed previous therapy with DAAs in genotype 1. AbbVie also submitted its regulatory application in the EU and remains on track for submission in Japan in the first quarter of 2017. The company anticipates commercialization of the next-generation combination in 2017. 

· AbbVie announced several new global research collaborations with leading healthcare innovators to advance early-stage research in key therapeutic areas such as oncology and immunology. These included a research and license agreement with Pure MHC, a privately-held target discovery company, to discover and validate peptide targets for use with T-cell receptor therapeutics in several types of cancers; an exclusive license with Dong-A-ST, a leading specialty healthcare company in South Korea, for MerTK inhibitors in pre-clinical development for use in conjunction with immuno-oncology therapies; and a partnership with Zebra Biologics, Inc., a discovery stage biotechnology company, to discover agonist antibody therapeutics for inflammatory diseases. 

Full-Year 2017 Outlook 

AbbVie is issuing GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the full-year 2017 of $4.55 to $4.65. AbbVie expects to deliver adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full-year 2017 of $5.44 to $5.54, representing growth of 13.9 percent at the mid-point. The company’s 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes $0.89 per share of intangible asset amortization expense and other specified items.
