        "(4) Free Cash Flow is reconciled above. Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net cash from operating activities (adjusted for service concession asset capital expenditures) less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures), net of reinsurance proceeds from third parties. AES believes that free cash flow is a useful measure for evaluating our financial condition because it represents the amount of cash generated by the business after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures that may be available for investing in growth opportunities or for repaying debt. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP."
