 Forward-Looking Statements; Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following information is current as of December 31, 2016 (unless otherwise noted) and should be read in connection with Navient Corporation’s (Navient) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the “2016 Form 10-K”), filed by Navient with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 24, 2017 and subsequent reports filed by Navient with the SEC. Definitions for capitalized terms in this presentation not defined herein can be found in our 2016 Form 10-K. This presentation contains “forward-looking” statements and other information that is based on management’s current expectations as of the date of this presentation. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs, opinions, or expectations and statements that assume or are dependent upon future events, are forward-looking statements and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” or “target.” Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. For us, these factors include, among others, the risks and uncertainties associated with: • increases in financing costs; • the availability of financing or limits on liquidity resulting from disruptions in the capital markets or other factors; • unanticipated increases in costs associated with compliance with federal, state or local laws and regulations; • changes in the marketplaces in which we compete (including changes in demand or changes resulting from new laws and regulations); • changes in accounting standards including but not limited to changes pertaining to loan loss reserves and estimates or other accounting standards that may impact our operations; • adverse outcomes in any significant litigation to which we are a party; • credit risk associated with our exposure to third parties, including counterparties to hedging or other derivative transactions; and • changes in the terms of education loans and the educational credit marketplace (including changes resulting from new laws and the implementation of existing laws). We could also be affected by, among other things: • unanticipated deferrals in our FFELP securitization trusts that would delay repayment of the bonds beyond their legal final maturity date; • reductions to our credit ratings, the credit ratings of asset-backed securitizations we sponsor or the credit ratings of the United States of America; • failures of our operating systems or infrastructure, or those of third-party vendors; • risks related to cybersecurity including the potential disruption of our systems or potential disclosure of confidential customer information; • damage to our reputation resulting from cyber-breaches, litigation, the politicization of student loan servicing or other actions or factors; • failures to successfully implement cost-cutting initiatives and adverse effects of such initiatives on our business; • delays or errors in converting portfolio acquisitions to our servicing platform; • changes in law and regulations including but not limited to changes with respect to the student lending or servicing business and financial institutions generally, securitizations or derivatives; • increased competition from banks and other consumer lenders; • the creditworthiness of our customers; • changes in the general interest rate environment, including the relationship between the relevant money-market index rate and the rate at which our assets are priced; • our ability to successfully effectuate any acquisitions and other strategic initiatives; • changes in the demand for asset management and business processing services; • changes in general economic conditions; and • the other factors that are described in the “Risk Factors” section of the 2016 Form 10-K and in our other reports filed with the SEC. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements also requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates or assumptions may prove to be incorrect and actual results could differ materially. All forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this presentation. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements except as required by law. Navient reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also provides certain non-GAAP “core earnings“ performance measures. When compared to GAAP results, “core earnings” exclude the impact of: (1) the financial results of the consumer banking business for historical periods prior to the April 30, 2014 spin-off of Navient from SLM Corporation as well as related restructuring and reorganization expenses incurred in connection with the spin-off, including the restructuring initiated in the second quarter of 2015; (2) unrealized, mark-to-market gains/losses on derivatives; and (3) goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization and impairment. Navient provides core earnings measures because this is what management uses when making management decisions regarding Navient’s performance and the allocation of corporate resources. Navient core earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, see “Core Earnings — Definition and Limitations” in Navient’s fourth quarter earnings release for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and core earnings.

As a result of this correction, the Private Education Loan discount balance increased by $9 million (resulting in a $9 million reduction to net interest income and a 0.14 percent reduction to fourth-quarter 2016 Private Education Loan net interest margin) and the FFELP Loan premium balance increased by $7 million (resulting in a $7 million increase to net interest income and a 0.03 percent increase to fourth-quarter 2016 FFELP Loan net interest margin). The net impact of this correction was a decrease of $2 million to net interest income 

 FFELP Loans Segment Credit Quality “Core Earnings” Basis (1) Loans for customers who may still be attending school or engaging in other permitted educational activities and are not yet required to make payments on their loans, e.g., residency periods for medical students or a grace period for bar exam preparation, as well as loans for customers who have requested and qualify for other permitted program deferments such as military, unemployment, or economic hardships. (2) Loans for customers who have used their allowable deferment time or do not qualify for deferment, that need additional time to obtain employment or who have temporarily ceased making full payments due to hardship or other factors. (3) The period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due.

The net impact of this correction was a decrease of $2 million to net interest income. 2 In 2015, the portion of the loan amount charged off at default increased from 73 percent to 79 percent. This did not impact the provision for loan losses as previously this had been reserved through the allowance for loan losses. This change resulted in a $330 million reduction to the balance of the receivable for partially charged-off loans. This $330 million is not included in the 2015 charge-offs of $659 million in the table above.

 Navient’s Default Prevention Expertise Was A Key Factor In The Decline Of The National Default Rate 2013 three-year cohort default rate The cohort default rate (CDR) measures the percent of borrowers who defaulted on a student loan within three years of entering repayment. In 2016, the Department of Education announced the 2013 three-year CDR fell from 11.8 percent to 11.3 percent. The three-year CDR for Navient-serviced customers was 8.4 percent, 31 percent lower than the national rate excluding Navient-serviced borrowers. Navient serviced 22 percent of all federal borrowers entering repayment in the 2013 cohort period, meaning Navient’s performance had a significant impact on the overall cohort default rate. Source: "Official Cohort Default Rates for Schools,” Federal Student Aid, 9/28/16; Navient data The 2013 Cohort Default Rate analyzes data from the group of borrowers who entered repayment between Oct. 1, 2012, and Sept. 30, 2013, and who defaulted in a three-year window by fall of 2015. To isolate the difference in defaults between Navient borrowers and others, the difference is calculated by removing Navient’s market share from the overall national cohort default rate. 8.4% Navient's CDR is 31 percent lower than all others 11.3% All borrowers (%)

 The cohort default triangles featured on subsequent slides are segmented by loan program type, FICO score, cosigner status, and school type Terms and calculations used in the cohort default triangles are defined below: Repayment Year – The calendar year loans entered repayment Disbursed Principal Entering Repayment – The amount of principal entering repayment in a given year, based on disbursed principal prior to any interest capitalization Years in Repayment – Measured in years between repayment start date and default date. Zero represents defaults that occurred prior to the start of repayment. Periodic Defaults – Defaulted principal in each Year in Repayment as a percentage of the disbursed principal entering repayment in each Repayment Year Defaulted principal includes any interest capitalization that occurred prior to default Defaulted principal is not reduced by any amounts recovered after the loan defaulted Because the numerator includes capitalized interest while the denominator does not, default rates are higher than if the numerator and denominator both included capitalized interest Total – The sum of Periodic Defaults across Years in Repayment for each Repayment Year Cohort Default Triangles
