[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Includes results for all of our run-off businesses. For the month, our run-off businesses generated a $0.1 million underwriting loss. 

2 The loss/LAE ratio includes 15 loss ratio points, or about $12 million, related to catastrophe losses from severe thunderstorms that hit the south in January. In addition, we recorded an increase to our reinsurance recoverable under reinsurance provided in connection with a catastrophe bond transaction, which reduced our loss/LAE ratio by 11.8 points, or $9.1 million. The total recoverable, which relates to losses incurred in excess of $175 million in the aggregate on severe thunderstorms (excluding named storms) during 2016, is $29.5 million.

3 Included in both the expense ratio and combined ratio is 6.7 points of amortization expense primarily associated with the acquisition of a controlling interest in ARX, as well as an increase to the prior year's bonus accrual (3.5 points) and the deferral of previously recognized net ceding commission income associated with ASI acting as a participant in the "Write Your Own" program for the National Flood Insurance Program (6.5 points); the net ceding commission income will now be recognized pro rata over the life of the flood policies. Excluding these additional expenses, the Property business would have reported an expense ratio of 25.4 and a combined ratio of 75.4 for January 2017.

4 Represents adjustments solely based on our actuarial reviews. For our Property business, the actuarial reserving methodology includes changes to catastrophe losses, while the reviews in our vehicle businesses do not include catastrophes.

Monthly Commentary

•In January, we experienced unfavorable prior accident year reserve development of 3.2 points. The unfavorable development was primarily the result of more November and December claims being reported in January than were anticipated in our year-end reserves. In January, incurred but not reported on November and December 2016 accidents are reflected in prior year development, rather than development in the current accident year as is the case for the remaining 11 months of the year.

Events

We plan to release February results on Friday, March 17, 2017, before the market opens.

Progressive is scheduled to hold a one-hour conference call to address questions on Friday, March 3, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., eastern time, subsequent to the posting of our 2016 Shareholders' Report online and the filing of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. Registration for the teleconference and webcast is available at http://investors.progressive.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=81824&p=irol-calendar.

These statements often use words such as “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events, and are subject to certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed herein. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions, and projections generally; inflation and changes in general economic conditions (including changes in interest rates and financial markets); the possible failure of one or more governmental, corporate, or other entities to make scheduled debt payments or satisfy other obligations; the potential or actual downgrading by one or more rating agencies of our securities or governmental, corporate, or other securities we hold; the financial condition of, and other issues relating to the strength of and liquidity available to, issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios and other companies with which we have ongoing business relationships, including reinsurers and other counterparties to certain financial transactions; the accuracy and adequacy of our pricing, loss reserving, and claims methodologies; the competitiveness of our pricing and the effectiveness of our initiatives to attract and retain more customers; initiatives by competitors and the effectiveness of our response; our ability to obtain regulatory approval for the introduction of products to new jurisdictions, for requested rate changes and the timing thereof and for any proposed acquisitions; the effectiveness of our brand strategy and advertising campaigns relative to those of competitors; legislative and regulatory developments at the state and federal levels, including, but not limited to, matters relating to vehicle and homeowners insurance, health care reform and tax law changes; the outcome of disputes relating to intellectual property rights; the outcome of litigation or governmental investigations that may be pending or filed against us; severe weather conditions and other catastrophe events; the effectiveness of our reinsurance programs; changes in vehicle usage and driving patterns, which may be influenced by oil and gas prices; changes in residential occupancy patterns and the effects of the emerging "sharing economy"; advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features, such as accident and loss prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles; our ability to accurately recognize and appropriately respond in a timely manner to changes in loss frequency and severity trends; technological advances; acts of war and terrorist activities; our ability to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems (including information technology systems), and business functions, and safeguard personal and sensitive information in our possession; our continued access to and functionality of third-party systems that are critical to our business; restrictions on our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to The Progressive Corporation; possible impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets if future results do not adequately support either, or both, of these items; court decisions, new theories of insurer liability or interpretations of insurance policy provisions and other trends in litigation; changes in health care and auto and property repair costs; and other matters described from time to time in our releases and publications, and in our periodic reports and other documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results, therefore, may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
