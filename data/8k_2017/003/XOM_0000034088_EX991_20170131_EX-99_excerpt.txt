[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

IRVING, Texas – January 31, 2017 – Exxon Mobil Corporation today announced estimated 2016 earnings of $7.8 billion, or $1.88 per diluted share. An asset recoverability review was completed in the fourth quarter and resulted in a U.S. Upstream asset impairment charge of about $2 billion mainly related to dry gas operations with undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains region of the U.S. Excluding the impairment charge, full year earnings were $9.9 billion compared with $16.2 billion a year earlier, reflecting lower commodity prices and refining margins. 

Fourth quarter earnings were $1.7 billion, including the impairment charge recorded during the period. Excluding the impairment charge, earnings of $3.7 billion were up from the $2.8 billion reported in the fourth quarter of 2015, due to higher liquids realizations partly offset by weaker refining margins.  

“ExxonMobil demonstrated solid operating performance in 2016. Financial results for the year were negatively impacted by the prolonged downturn in commodity prices and the impairment charge,” said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “The company’s continued focus on fundamentals and our ability to leverage an attractive global portfolio through our integrated business ensures we are well positioned to generate long-term shareholder value.”

ExxonMobil completed five major Upstream projects during the year in Australia, Kazakhstan and the U.S., adding 250,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. The company made three important new discoveries in Guyana, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, and is growing its exploration portfolio, capturing 16 exploration blocks in 2016 with three additional awards to be finalized in 2017. 

In the Downstream segment, ExxonMobil completed a 20,000-barrel-per-day crude expansion project at the Beaumont, Texas, refinery that increased the site’s flexibility to process domestic light crude oils. ExxonMobil is also advancing projects to increase production of higher-value fuels and lubricants, including investments at refineries in Belgium and the Netherlands. 

The Chemical business continued to capitalize on its liquids and gas cracking capabilities, capturing increased specialty and commodity product demand. The company is selectively investing to extend its advantage with projects that expand production capacity for ethylene and related products around the world.  

During 2016, the corporation distributed $12.5 billion in dividends to shareholders.

In January 2017, ExxonMobil announced an acquisition that will more than double its Permian Basin resource potential to six billion oil‑equivalent barrels. The upfront acquisition cost of $5.6 billion, to be paid in ExxonMobil shares, will add resource potential of 3.4 billion oil‑equivalent barrels across 250,000 net acres in New Mexico’s Delaware Basin. Additional cash payments over time totaling up to $1 billion are contingent on resource development.  

•   

In January 2017, ExxonMobil announced positive results from its Payara-1 well offshore Guyana. The well encountered more than 95 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs, and is the second discovery on the Stabroek Block. In addition to the Payara discovery, appraisal drilling at Liza-3 has identified an additional high-quality, deeper reservoir directly below the Liza field. This deeper reservoir is estimated to contain resources between 100 million and 150 million oil-equivalent barrels.

ExxonMobil announced plans to add a new production unit at its Beaumont, Texas, polyethylene plant that will increase capacity by 65 percent, or approximately 650,000 metric tons per year, to meet growing global chemical demand. Construction of the new unit has begun at the plant and start-up is expected in 2019.   

Fourth Quarter 2016 vs. Fourth Quarter 2015 

Upstream earnings were a loss of $642 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, including an impairment charge of $2 billion mainly related to dry gas operations with undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains region of the U.S. Excluding the impairment charge, earnings were $1.4 billion, up $528 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. Higher liquids realizations partially offset by lower gas realizations increased earnings by a net $510 million. Lower volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $50 million. All other items, including lower expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable non-U.S. tax items from the prior year, increased earnings by $70 million.  

On an oil‑equivalent basis, production was down 127,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. Liquids production totaled 2.4 million barrels per day, down 97,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower entitlements were partly offset by increased project volumes, notably in Nigeria and Indonesia. Natural gas production was 10.4 billion cubic feet per day, down 179 million cubic feet per day from 2015 as higher project volumes were more than offset by field decline and lower entitlements. 

U.S. Upstream earnings were a loss of $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, including an impairment charge of $2 billion. Excluding the impairment charge, earnings were a loss of $301 million, an improvement of $237 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. Non‑U.S. Upstream earnings were $1.7 billion, up $291 million from the prior year period. 

Downstream earnings were $1.2 billion, down $110 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. Weaker refining and marketing margins decreased earnings by $570 million, while favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $200 million. All other items increased earnings by $260 million as gains from divestments in Canada were partly offset by higher maintenance expense and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Petroleum product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were down 173,000 barrels per day from the prior year mainly reflecting the divestment of refineries in California and Louisiana.  

Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $270 million, down $165 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. Non‑U.S. Downstream earnings of $971 million were $55 million higher than prior year.

Upstream Asset Impairment Charge 

As disclosed in the corporation’s third quarter 2016 Form 10-Q filing, continued weakness in the upstream industry environment during 2016, continued weak financial results for several assets in North America, and a reduction in the mid‑point of the ranges of the corporation’s long‑term oil and natural gas prices developed as part of its annual planning and budgeting cycle, led the corporation to conclude that the facts and circumstances supported performing an impairment assessment of certain long-lived assets, notably North America natural gas assets and certain other assets across the remainder of its Upstream operations. The assessment reflected long‑term crude and natural gas prices which are consistent with the mid‑point of the ranges that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities and which are in the range of long‑term price forecasts published by third‑party industry experts and government agencies. This assessment indicated that the vast majority of asset groups have future undiscounted cash flow estimates exceeding carrying values. However, the carrying values for certain asset groups in the United States exceeded the estimated cash flows. As a result, the corporation’s fourth quarter 2016 results include an after-tax charge of $2 billion to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value. The asset groups subject to this impairment charge are primarily dry gas operations in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States with large undeveloped acreage positions.

We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.  

Frequently Used Terms and Non-GAAP Measures 

This press release includes cash flow from operations and asset sales. Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in Attachment II. This press release also includes earnings excluding an impairment charge related to the fourth quarter 2016 Upstream asset recoverability assessment. We believe this figure is useful for investors to consider in comparing the performance of our underlying business across periods when one of the periods, such as fourth quarter 2016, includes a significant impairment charge. A reconciliation of earnings excluding this impairment charge to GAAP earnings is shown on page six. References to quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as “proved reserves” under SEC definitions. Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other terms including “prime product sales” is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available through the “Investors” section of our website at exxonmobil.com.
