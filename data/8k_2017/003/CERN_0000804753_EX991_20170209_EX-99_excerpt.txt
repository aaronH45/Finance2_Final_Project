KANSAS CITY, Mo. - February 9, 2017 - Cerner Corporation (Nasdaq: CERN) today announced results for the 2016 fourth quarter and full year that ended December 31, 2016.

Bookings in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $1.44 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared to $1.35 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 and within the Company’s guidance range. Full-year 2016 bookings were a record $5.45 billion, up slightly compared to 2015 bookings of $5.43 billion.

Fourth quarter revenue was $1.26 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared to $1.18 billion in the year-ago period and within the Company’s guidance range. Full-year 2016 revenue was $4.80 billion, up 8 percent compared to 2015 revenue of $4.43 billion.

On a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, fourth quarter 2016 net earnings were $149.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.44. Fourth quarter 2015 GAAP net earnings were $166.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.48. For the full year, 2016 GAAP net earnings were $636.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.85. Full year 2015 GAAP net earnings were $539.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.54.

Adjusted Net Earnings for fourth quarter 2016 were $206.2 million, compared to $212.3 million of Adjusted Net Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share were $0.61 in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is flat to the year-ago quarter and within the Company’s guidance range. Analysts’ consensus estimate for fourth quarter 2016 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share was $0.61. For the full year 2016, Adjusted Net Earnings were $790.4 million and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share were $2.30, compared to full year 2015 Adjusted Net Earnings of $741.1 million and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share of $2.11.

Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are not recognized terms under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be substituted for GAAP net earnings or GAAP diluted earnings per share, respectively, as measures of Cerner’s performance, but instead should be utilized as supplemental measures of financial performance in evaluating our business. Please see the accompanying schedule, titled “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results,” where our non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures.

Other 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Highlights:

▪Fourth quarter operating cash flow of $333.2 million and full-year of $1.156 billion.

▪Fourth quarter Free Cash Flow of $136.8 million. For the full year, Free Cash Flow was $402.5 million. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP cash flows from operating activities less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs. Please see the accompanying schedule, titled "Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results."

▪Fourth quarter days sales outstanding of 69 days, down from 80 days in the year-ago period.

▪Total backlog of $15.927 billion, up 12 percent over the year-ago quarter.

Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). However, we supplement our GAAP results with certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review and understanding of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to GAAP results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with Cerner's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculations. We provide the measures of Adjusted Operating Earnings, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as such measures are used by management, along with GAAP results, to analyze Cerner's business, make strategic decisions, assess long-term trends on a comparable basis, and for management compensation purposes. We provide the measure of Free Cash Flow as such measure takes into account certain capital expenditures necessary to operate our business. Free Cash Flow is used by management, along with GAAP results, to analyze our earnings quality and overall cash generation of the business.

We calculate each of our non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

Adjusted Operating Earnings - Consists of GAAP operating earnings adjusted for: (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) Health Services acquisition-related amortization, (iii) acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, (iv) other acquisition-related adjustments, and (v) voluntary separation plan expense.

Adjusted Net Earnings - Consists of GAAP net earnings adjusted for: (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) Health Services acquisition-related amortization, (iii) acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, (iv) other acquisition-related adjustments, (v) voluntary separation plan expense, and (vi) the income tax effect of the aforementioned items.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share - Consists of Adjusted Net Earnings, as defined above, divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, in the applicable period.

Free Cash Flow - Consists of cash flows from operating activities, less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs.

Adjustments included in the calculations of Adjusted Operating Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings are described below:

Share-based compensation expense - Non-cash expense arising from our equity compensation and stock purchase plans available to our associates and directors. We exclude share-based compensation expense as we believe the amount of such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Share-based compensation expense is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Health Services acquisition-related amortization - Non-cash expense consisting of the amortization of customer relationships, acquired technology, and trade name intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. We exclude Health Services acquisition-related amortization as we believe the amount of such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption "Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles."

Acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment - Consists of acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments in connection with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. Accounting guidance requires that deferred revenue acquired in a business combination be written-down to an estimate of fulfillment cost, plus a normal profit margin, as a part of the allocation 

of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We add back the amount of the write-down applicable to the period as we believe such amount directly correlates to the underlying performance of our business operations.

Other acquisition-related adjustments - Consists of acquisition, employee separation, and other costs associated with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. We exclude other acquisition-related adjustments as they are non-recurring charges, and we believe the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption "General and administrative" expense.

Voluntary separation plan expense - Consists of expense associated with our voluntary separation plans available to certain associates for specific time periods in 2016 and 2015. We exclude voluntary separation plan expense as we believe the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption "General and administrative" expense.

Income tax effect of pre-tax adjustments - The GAAP effective income tax rate for the applicable quarterly period is applied to pre-tax adjustments for Adjusted Net Earnings.

Cerner's future period guidance in this release includes adjustments for items not indicative of our core operations, which may include without limitation share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, such as integration expenses, and may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments relating to the Company's acquired businesses, and may also be affected by nonrecurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, all of which are excluded in the calculation of non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Earnings, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as described above. The exact amount of these adjustments are not currently determinable, but may be significant. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile this non-GAAP guidance to the most comparable GAAP measures.
