Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On January 18, 2017, Autodesk, Inc. (“Autodesk”) and Citibank, N.A., along with other lenders constituting the Required Lenders under the Company’s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2015 (the “Credit Agreement”), waived the requirements of, and compliance by Autodesk with, Section 5.03(a) of the Credit Agreement. Section 5.03(a) requires Autodesk to comply with a maximum debt to capitalization ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As a result of its business model transition, Autodesk is discussing amendments to the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement with the lenders and expects to conclude this process during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

The foregoing description of the waiver does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the waiver, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
