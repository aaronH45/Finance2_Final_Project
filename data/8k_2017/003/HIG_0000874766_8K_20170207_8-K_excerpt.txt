Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation

On February 8, 2017, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the “Company”) delivered an exercise notice (the “Put Notice”) under Section 3.1 of the put option agreement dated as of February 12, 2007 (the “Put Option Agreement”) among the Company, Glen Meadow ABC Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the “ABC Trust”), and Wilmington Trust Company (as successor to LaSalle Bank National Association) (“Wilmington”), as put option calculation agent. Pursuant to the Put Notice, the Company is requiring the ABC Trust to purchase the Company’s junior subordinated notes (the “Notes”) for the designated amount of $500,000,000 on the terms set forth in the junior subordinated indenture, dated as of February 12, 2007, between the Company and Wilmington, as trustee (the “Indenture”). The settlement date of the issuance of the Notes will be February 15, 2017. 

The Notes will have a scheduled maturity of February 12, 2047, and a final maturity of February 12, 2067. The Company will be required to repay the principal amount of the Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, on the scheduled maturity date in specified circumstances only to the extent it has raised sufficient proceeds from the issuance of specified securities. The Notes will bear interest at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.125%, payable quarterly, and will be unsecured, subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Company will have the right, on one or more occasions, to defer interest payments due on the Notes under specified circumstances. 

Item 8.01 Other Events

On February 7, 2017, the Company executed an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the replacement capital covenant dated as of June 6, 2008 (as amended, the “RCC”). Capitalized terms used under this item 8.01 but not otherwise defined have the meaning ascribed in the RCC.

The RCC is in favor of and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder and was originally executed in connection with the June 2008 issuance by the Company of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068.

The intent and effect of the Amendment is to (i) change the Measurement Period for purposes of calculating the proceeds received from the sale of certain replacement capital securities from 180 days to 550 days, and (ii) amend the definition of one category of Qualifying Replacement Securities as set forth in the RCC by changing clause (b)(ii)(2) of the definition of Qualifying Replacement Securities to require a 50 year maturity date rather than a 60 year maturity date.

The foregoing description of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
