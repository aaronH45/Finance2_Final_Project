GREG CREED & DAVID GIBBS COMMENTS

“2016 was a landmark year for Yum! Brands,” said Greg Creed, CEO. “Not only did we complete the spin-off of Yum China as an independent and powerful growth company, but we also launched a new multi-year strategic transformation of Yum! Brands. By being more focused, more franchised and more efficient, we will strengthen and grow our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands around the world, creating significant long-term value for all our stakeholders. I’m encouraged by strong fourth-quarter results and early progress on unlocking growth through our four key drivers: Distinctive, Relevant Brands; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; Bold Restaurant Development; and Unrivaled Culture and Talent.”

David Gibbs, President and CFO, continued “I am pleased with our fourth quarter core operating profit growth of 27%, which was a solid end to an extraordinary year. As a testament to the power of our brands, KFC and Taco Bell had relatively strong performance in December, despite difficult U.S. industry conditions. This momentum has continued into the new year. As we look forward, we are confident in our three-year plans and there is no change to our long-term guidance.”

SUMMARY FINANCIAL TABLE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1See Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Measurements for further detail of Special Items.

All comparisons are versus the same period a year ago. Effective January 2016, the three restaurant brands of our India business were integrated into our global KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Divisions. Prior year figures have been restated to present comparable results. 

Historical GAAP information attributable to our China operations prior to the separation is included in Discontinued Operations. Historical KFC and Pizza Hut segment results have been adjusted to reflect a 3% license fee between Yum! Brands, Inc. and Yum China Holdings, Inc. that was previously eliminated within our consolidated financial statements. A corresponding 3% license expense is included in Discontinued Operations such that there is no impact on previously reported net income.

Unless otherwise noted, all results include a 53rd week in 2016.

Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Measurements

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results from Continuing Operations in 2016 and 2015 on a basis before Special Items. These Special Items are described in (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) in the accompanying notes.

The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of the operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and Special Items are not included in any of our segment results. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings from Continuing Operations before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in the quarters and years ended December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Consolidated Balance Sheets

and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

(a)Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 are preliminary.

(b)We have historically recorded refranchising gains and losses in the U.S. as Special Items due to the scope of our U.S. refranchising program and the volatility in associated gains and losses. Beginning in 2016, we are also including all international refranchising gains and losses in Special Items. The inclusion in Special Items of these additional international refranchising gains and losses is the result of the anticipated size and volatility of refranchising initiatives outside the U.S. that will take place in connection with our previously announced plans to have at least 98% franchise ownership by the end of 2018. During the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 we recorded net refranchising gains of $64 million and $49 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 we recorded net refranchising gains of $141 million and net refranchising losses of $20 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items.

The fourth quarter 2016 net refranchising gains relate primarily to refranchising Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. and KFC restaurants in Thailand. The net refranchising gains for the year 2016 relate primarily to refranchising Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. The fourth quarter 2015 net refranchising gains relate primarily to refranchising Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S.

The net refranchising losses for the year 2015 relate to our Mexico and Korea businesses, partially offset by refranchising gains related to Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. In 2010 we refranchised our then remaining Company-operated restaurants in Mexico. To the extent we owned it, we did not sell the real estate related to certain of these restaurants, instead leasing it to the franchisee. During the quarter ended June 13, 2015 we initiated plans to sell this real estate and determined it was held for sale in accordance with GAAP. On September 28, 2015, subsequent to our quarter ended September 5, 2015, we sold the real estate for approximately $58 million. While these proceeds exceeded the book value of the real estate, the sale represented a substantial liquidation of our Mexican operations under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, we were required to include accumulated translation losses associated with our Mexican business within our carrying value when performing impairment evaluations in the quarters subsequent to determining that the real estate was held for sale. We recorded charges of $80 million in the year ended December 26, 2015, representing the excess of the sum of the book value of the real estate and other related assets and our accumulated translation losses over the then expected sales price. Consistent with the classification of the original market refranchising transaction, these charges were classified as Refranchising Loss within Special Items. We did not record any additional charges as a result of the consummation of the sale.

Additionally, during the quarter and year ended December 26, 2015 we recognized Special Items charges of $3 million and $16 million, respectively, within Refranchising (gain) loss associated with the decision to offer to refranchise our Pizza Hut Korea restaurants.

(c)As part of our plan to transform our global business we took several measures to increase focus on development of brands, increase our franchise ownership and creating a leaner, more efficient cost structure (“YUM’s Strategic Transformation initiatives”). During the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 we recognized Special Item charges of $39 million and $71 million, respectively, related to these initiatives. The majority of these costs related to severance costs and charges associated with a voluntary retirement program offered to certain U.S. employees that were recorded within G&A expense.

(d)In connection with the separation of Yum China we modified certain share-based compensation awards held as part of our Executive Income Deferral Plan in YUM stock to provide one Yum China share-based award for each outstanding YUM share-based award. These Yum China awards may now be settled in cash, as opposed to stock, which requires recognition of the fair value of these awards each quarter in our income statement. Cumulative fair value in excess of previously recorded expense as of December 31, 2016 and related costs resulted in non-cash Special Item charges of $30 million being recorded to G&A expense for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. 

(e)During the first quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with our KFC U.S. franchisees that gave us brand marketing control as well as an accelerated path to improved assets and customer experience. In connection with this agreement we recognized Special Item charges of $9 million and $41 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, we recognized Special Item charges of $26 million and $72 

16

million, respectively. The majority of these costs were recorded in Franchise and license expense. These charges primarily related to the funding of investments for new back-of-house equipment for franchisees.

(f)During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company allowed certain former employees with deferred vested balances in the YUM Retirement Plan an opportunity to voluntarily elect an early payout of their pension benefits. As a result of payments made of $225 million related to this program exceeding the sum of service and interest costs within the Plan, we recorded a Special Items settlement charge of $24 million in G&A expense during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, we incurred program costs of $1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.
