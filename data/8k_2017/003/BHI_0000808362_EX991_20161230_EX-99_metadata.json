        " (h)The year ended December 31, 2015, reflects the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments based on the estimated blended statutory tax rate of 35%. The nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflects the income tax benefit of the pro forma adjustments based on the estimated blended statutory rate of 35% partially offset by valuation allowances resulting in no tax benefit associated with the Canadian results and no tax benefit on the goodwill impairment due to lack of tax basis. Additionally, an adjustment of $48 million for tax benefits was made to reflect a reduction in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, which Baker Hughes would recognize on a pro forma basis when excluding the results of the Onshore Pressure Pumping Business."
