ATLANTA, Feb. 9, 2017 – The Coca-Cola Company today reported fourth quarter and full year 2016 operating results. Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola Company, said, "We are pleased to report that we ended 2016 with fourth quarter top- and bottom-line growth within our expectations. Strong price/mix stemming from our continued focus on driving revenue and solid performance in our developed markets helped offset persistent macroeconomic pressures in our emerging and developing markets. Our flagship market of North America grew net revenues 8% for the quarter and 4% for the year, outperforming total retail value growth for both the North America nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry and U.S. consumer packaged goods companies."

"In addition to delivering our profit target for the full year, I am encouraged by the strategic actions taken during 2016 to strengthen our global bottling system. In the fourth quarter, we reached a definitive agreement to refranchise all Company-owned bottling operations in China, and we took important steps to further the evolution of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. During the year, we successfully completed the creation of Coca-Cola European Partners, and we supported the ongoing transformation of the franchise bottling system in Japan. And last, we remain on track to complete the refranchising of Company-owned bottling operations in the United States by the end of 2017. In total, half of our global system revenue has been in motion through our recent actions to strengthen the system. The progress demonstrated by these actions is foundational in positioning our system for prosperity long into the future."

"We also recently made an important decision about the future leadership of The Coca-Cola Company with the announcement that James Quincey will become our next CEO, effective May 1. Having worked closely with James for many years, I know that his knowledge and experience make him the ideal candidate to lead our Company and bottling system into the future. I am partnering with James to ensure a smooth CEO transition and look forward to providing continued support as Chairman of the Board of Directors." 

Highlights

Quarterly / Full Year Performance

•Net revenues were $9.4 billion for the quarter, a 6% decline from prior year, impacted by a foreign currency exchange headwind of 2% and a headwind from acquisitions, divestitures, and structural items of 10%. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 6% in the quarter, driven by price/mix growth of 6%. Core business organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 7% in the quarter.

•Net revenues were $41.9 billion for the full year, a 5% decline from the prior year, impacted by a foreign currency exchange headwind of 3% and a headwind from acquisitions, divestitures, and structural items of 6%. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) for the full year grew 3%, driven by price/mix growth of 3%. Core business organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 4% for the full year.

•We gained global value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink ("NARTD") beverages and sparkling beverages in both the quarter and the full year.

•Total unit case volume declined 1% for the quarter and grew 1% for the full year. For the quarter, low single-digit unit case volume growth in our developed markets was offset by continued macroeconomic challenges in several Latin American markets. North America grew unit case volume 1% in the quarter, including 1% growth in sparkling beverages. For the full year, our developed markets grew low single digits while our emerging and developing markets were even.

•Our operating margin for the quarter contracted nearly 80 basis points and our operating margin for the full year expanded more than 90 basis points. These measures included items impacting comparability, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and structural impacts. Our comparable currency neutral operating margin (non-GAAP) in the quarter expanded nearly 230 basis points and expanded nearly 140 basis points for the full year. These improvements were driven by continued extensions of our pricing initiatives, a slightly favorable cost environment, and our productivity program.

Company Updates

Strong momentum in transforming our business continued through the last quarter of the year, with key actions driving positive results in many markets around the world. Notable developments included:

•Disciplined brand and growth investments: We advanced our strategy to grow revenues and profits from our sparkling beverage portfolio while at the same time helping consumers reduce consumption of added sugars. In Western Europe, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar once again grew unit case volume double digits in the quarter, boosted by expansion into France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Ireland. These recent moves extend the product beyond its initial launch market of Great Britain. Further expansion is planned in early 2017 for other European markets, Australia, and South Africa, among others. In addition to these moves in our sparkling portfolio, we continued the global expansion of smartwater, one of our premium water brands. While smartwater achieved double-digit unit case volume growth during the year 

2

in its home market of North America, it also helped drive full year high single-digit unit case volume growth in the still water category for our Western Europe business unit.

•Innovating in different ways: Portfolio innovations in the quarter extended beyond ongoing product and reformulation initiatives. Sparkling beverage performance in Japan kept its momentum in the quarter, boosted by the Coca-Cola ribbon package innovation that was made available in the market during November and December. This festive bottle for Trademark Coca-Cola brands in Japan provided consumers with a label that could be transformed into a holiday bow. Coffee in Japan also continued to grow, driven by the bottle-can package innovation for GEORGIA The Premium launched in early 2016. In our Central & Eastern Europe business unit, the launch of a new Fanta spiral bottle led to full year mid single-digit unit case volume growth for the brand and helped drive a value share gain in sparkling beverages for the full year.

•Strengthening the global bottling system: We remain on track to complete the refranchising of our Company-owned bottling operations in the United States by the end of 2017. In China, we signed a definitive agreement with COFCO Coca-Cola Beverages Limited and Swire Beverages Holdings Limited to refranchise all existing Company-owned bottling operations. We also reached an important agreement in the evolution of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa ("CCBA") regarding the transition of Anheuser-Busch InBev's 54.5% stake in CCBA as well as its interests in other African and Latin American bottling operations. 

•Planning a seamless leadership transition: In December, the Board of Directors unanimously approved Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent's recommendation for Company veteran James Quincey to become the next CEO, effective May 1, 2017. Kent will continue as Chairman of the Board of Directors following the CEO succession. The Board intends to nominate Quincey to stand for election as a director at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareowners in April.

•Advancing sustainable business practices: We continued to advance sustainability investments around the world. During the quarter, we announced a combined pledge with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) of up to $22 million to support the next five-year phase of USAID's Water and Development Alliance (WADA). This initiative aims to provide safe water access and sanitation to communities in developing nations in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America. During the first phase of this partnership from 2005 to 2017, 35 projects were implemented in 30 different countries. By the end of 2015, these projects had yielded improved water access to over 600,000 people and improved sanitation for over 250,000 people.

3 Effective August 1, 2016, the Company formed a new Europe, Middle East & Africa operating group consisting of business units that were previously included in the Europe and the Eurasia & Africa operating groups.

In addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results were impacted by the following:

Consolidated

•Positive price/mix in the quarter included 2 points of positive segment mix, primarily driven by Latin America. Segment mix did not have a significant impact on the full year positive price/mix. 

•Sparkling beverage unit case volume declined 2% for the quarter and was even for the full year. Still beverage unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter and 3% for the full year.

5

•The decline in income before taxes for both the quarter and the full year included items impacting comparability, primarily due to the derecognition of intangible assets associated with the refranchising of bottling territories in North America. The decline was also impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and structural items. Comparable currency neutral income before taxes (structurally adjusted) (non-GAAP) for both the quarter and the full year benefited from the impact of our productivity initiatives and an increase in equity income, partially offset by a swing from net interest income to net interest expense.

•Cash from operations for the full year was $8.8 billion, down $1.7 billion. This decrease was driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and our ongoing refranchising of North America bottling territories as well as bottling transactions in Europe and Africa.

•Purchases of stock for treasury for the full year were $3.7 billion. Net share repurchases (non-GAAP) totaled $2.3 billion for the full year.

Europe, Middle East & Africa

•Even price/mix for the quarter included 1 point of unfavorable geographic mix. Positive price/mix for the full year included 1 point of favorable geographic mix. Acquisitions, divestitures, and structural items for the quarter and the full year reflect the impact of bottling transactions in Europe and Africa.

•The decline in income before taxes for both the quarter and the full year included the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and structural items. Comparable currency neutral income before taxes (non-GAAP) for both the quarter and the full year included the unfavorable impact of bottling transactions in Europe and Africa.

•We gained value share in still beverages during the quarter. Unit case volume growth of 1% for both the quarter and the full year included 1 point of growth from acquired brands, which were primarily water brands in Africa. For the full year, sparkling beverage volume was even and still beverage volume grew 3%. Unit case volume growth for the year in our West Africa and Middle East & North Africa business units was partially offset by a decline in our Central & Eastern Europe business unit, which was primarily driven by a unit case volume decline in Russia. 

Latin America

•Positive price/mix for the quarter and for the full year benefited from solid performance in Mexico and several inflationary markets across Latin America.

•We gained value share in total NARTD beverages, sparkling beverages and still beverages during the quarter. For the full year, sparkling beverage volume declined 2% and still beverage volume grew 2%. The total unit case volume decline of 1% for the year was driven by high single-digit declines in both 

6

our Brazil and Latin Center business units amidst continued macroeconomic challenges in those regions. These declines were partially offset by mid single-digit unit case volume growth in Mexico.

North America

•Positive price/mix for the quarter and for the full year reflects the continued execution of disciplined occasion, brand, price, and package strategy. Sparkling beverage price/mix grew 4% for the quarter and 3% for the full year.

•Income before taxes for both the quarter and the full year included items impacting comparability and structural impacts. Comparable currency neutral income before taxes (non-GAAP) for the quarter was favorably impacted by the ongoing refranchising in North America.

•We gained value share in total NARTD beverages for the 27th consecutive quarter. For the full year, sparkling beverage volume growth was slightly positive, rounding to even. Growth in Sprite, Fanta, and energy drinks was offset primarily by a decline in Diet Coke. Full year still beverage volume grew 3%, primarily driven by growth in water which included double-digit growth in smartwater. Volume in the dairy category grew double digits and vitaminwater grew mid single digits.

Asia Pacific

•Positive price/mix for the quarter included 1 point of favorable geographic mix. Geographic mix did not have a significant impact on the negative price/mix for the full year.

•We gained value share in sparkling beverages during the quarter. For the full year, sparkling beverage volume growth was slightly positive, rounding to even. Full year still beverage volume grew 5%. Unit case volume growth for the full year included mid single-digit growth in our ASEAN business unit and low single-digit growth in our Japan business unit, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our Greater China & Korea business unit.

Bottling Investments

•Full year positive price/mix reflects solid performance across several of our key bottling operations, particularly North America and India.

•The decline in income before taxes for both the quarter and the full year included items impacting comparability and structural impacts. For both the quarter and the full year, comparable currency neutral income before taxes (non-GAAP) was unfavorably impacted by the ongoing refranchising of North America bottling territories and the deconsolidation of our German and South African bottling operations. For the full year, comparable currency neutral income before taxes (non-GAAP) also included a favorable impact from the expanded distribution of Monster Beverage Corporation products.

Outlook

Our 2017 outlook for organic revenues, comparable currency neutral income before taxes (structurally adjusted), and comparable EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, and the impact of structural items, as applicable. We are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the exact timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and/or structural changes throughout 2017. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our full year 2017 GAAP financial results.

Full Year 2017 Underlying Performance:

•Approximately 3% growth in organic revenues (non-GAAP)

•7% to 8% growth in comparable currency neutral income before taxes (structurally adjusted) (non-GAAP), driven by strong operating performance partially offset by an increasing interest rate environment

Full Year 2017 Currency Impact:

•Net revenues: 1% to 2% headwind based on the current spot rates and including the impact of hedged positions

•Income before taxes: 3% to 4% headwind based on the current spot rates and including the impact of hedged positions

Full Year 2017 Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Structural Items Impact:

•Net revenues: 18% to 19% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures, and structural items

•Income before taxes: 5% to 6% structural headwind

Full Year 2017 Other Items:

•Underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP): 24%*

•Net share repurchases (non-GAAP): Approximately $2.0 billion

•Net capital expenditures: $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion

Full Year 2017 EPS: Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) 1% to 4% decline versus $1.91 in 2016

First Quarter 2017 Considerations:

•Net revenues: 12% to 13% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures, and structural items; 1% to 2% currency headwind based on the current spot rates and including the impact of hedged positions

•Income before taxes: 1% to 2% structural headwind; 3% to 4% currency headwind based on the current spot rates and including the impact of hedged positions

•Two fewer days when compared to first quarter 2016

Full Year 2018 Considerations:

•Net revenues: 16% to 17% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures, and structural items 

•Income before taxes: 1% to 2% structural headwind; low single-digit currency headwind based on the current spot rates and including the impact of hedged positions

•Underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP): 26%*

*Does not include any impact from potential tax reform

Notes

•All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period.

•All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales for the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. "Unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 24 eight-ounce servings of finished beverage. "Unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers.

•"Core business" represents the combined performance from the Europe, Middle East & Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; and Corporate operating segments offset by intersegment eliminations.

•"Concentrate sales" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, and powders sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, "concentrate sales" represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments (expressed in equivalent unit cases) after considering the impact of structural changes. For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes. Our Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.

•"Price, product, and geographic mix" represents the change in revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories in which sales occurred.

•"Sparkling beverages" means NARTD beverages with carbonation, including carbonated energy drinks and waters.

•"Still beverages" means nonalcoholic beverages without carbonation, including noncarbonated waters, flavored waters and enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, teas, coffees, sports drinks, dairy, and noncarbonated energy drinks.

•First quarter 2016 financial results were impacted by one less day and fourth quarter 2016 financial results were impacted by two additional days. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variance in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(UNAUDITED)

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred to herein as "reported"). To supplement our consolidated financial statements reported on a GAAP basis, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures: "Organic revenues", "core business organic revenues", "comparable currency neutral operating margin", "comparable currency neutral income before taxes", "comparable currency neutral income before taxes (structurally adjusted)", "comparable EPS", "comparable currency neutral EPS", "underlying effective tax rate" and "net share repurchases", each of which are defined below. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are also included. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and Company management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance.

DEFINITIONS

•"Currency neutral operating results" are determined by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results, normalizing for certain structural items in hyperinflationary economies, by the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as appropriate, the derived current period local currency operating results by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to translate the Company's financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not changed from the comparable prior year period.

•"Structural changes" generally refer to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling, distribution or canning operations and the consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling and distribution entities for accounting purposes. During 2016, the Company deconsolidated our South African bottling operations and disposed of its related equity method investment in exchange for equity method investments in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Limited ("CCBA") and CCBA's South African subsidiary. As part of the transaction, the Company also acquired and licensed several brands. The impacts of the deconsolidation and new equity method investments have been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Bottling Investments operating segments and equity income on a consolidated basis as well as for our Bottling Investments operating segment. The brands and licenses that the Company acquired impacted the Company’s unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and therefore, in addition to being included as a structural change, they are also considered acquired brands. Also in 2016, the Company deconsolidated our German bottling operations as a result of their being merged to create Coca-Cola European Partners plc ("CCEP"). As a result of the merger transaction, the Company now owns an equity method investment in CCEP. Accordingly, the impact of the deconsolidation and new equity method investment has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Bottling Investments operating segments and equity income on a consolidated basis as well as for our Bottling Investments operating segment. During 2016, the Company also changed our funding arrangement with our bottling partners in China, which resulted in a reduction in net operating revenues with an offsetting reduction in direct marketing expense (a component of selling, general and administration expenses). In 2016 and 2015, the Company refranchised bottling territories in North America to certain of its unconsolidated bottling partners. Additionally, in 2015, the Company sold its global energy drink business to Monster Beverage Corporation ("Monster"); acquired Monster's non-energy drink business; acquired an equity interest in Monster; amended its current distribution coordination agreements with Monster to expand into additional territories; and acquired a South African bottler.

DEFINITIONS (continued)

Accordingly, these activities have been included as structural items in our analysis of the impact of these changes on certain line items in our condensed consolidated statements of income. In addition, for non-Company-owned and licensed beverage products sold in the refranchised territories in North America for which the Company no longer reports unit case volume, we have eliminated the unit case volume from the base year when calculating 2016 versus 2015 volume growth rates on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America and Bottling Investments operating segments.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•"Comparable currency neutral operating margin", "comparable currency neutral income before taxes" and "comparable currency neutral income before taxes (structurally adjusted)" are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below) and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Comparable currency neutral income before taxes (structurally adjusted) (non-GAAP) has also been adjusted for structural changes. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable currency neutral operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion, comparable currency neutral income before taxes (non-GAAP) growth and comparable currency neutral income before taxes (structurally adjusted) (non-GAAP) growth measures enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results.

•"Comparable EPS" and "comparable currency neutral EPS" are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) has also been adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable EPS (non-GAAP) and comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth measures enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results. 

•"Underlying effective tax rate" is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the estimated annual effective income tax rate on income before taxes that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below).

DEFINITIONS (continued)

•"Net share repurchases" is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects the net amount of purchases of stock for treasury after considering proceeds from the issuances of stock, the net change in stock issuance receivables (related to employee stock options exercised but not settled prior to the end of the period) and the net change in treasury stock payables (for treasury shares repurchased but not settled prior to the end of the period).

ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY

The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as "items impacting comparability" based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions; and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as pertaining to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered "items impacting comparability". Items impacting comparability include asset impairments and restructuring charges, charges related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives, and transaction gains/losses, in each case when exceeding a U.S. dollar threshold. Also included are timing differences related to our economic (nondesignated) hedging activities and our proportionate share of similar items incurred by our equity method investees, regardless of size. In addition, we provide the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency neutral operating results" defined above).

Asset Impairments and Restructuring

Asset Impairments

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded charges of $153 million related to certain intangible assets. These charges included $143 million related to the impairment of certain U.S. bottlers' franchise rights recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment. This charge was related to a number of factors, primarily as a result of lower operating performance compared to previously modeled results as well as a revision in management's view of the proceeds that may be ultimately received upon refranchising the territory. The remaining charge of $10 million was related to an impairment of goodwill recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment. This charge was primarily the result of management's revised outlook on market conditions. These charges of $153 million were recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment.

Restructuring

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded charges of $240 million. The Company also recorded charges of $88 million and $292 million during the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. These charges were related to the integration of our German bottling operations, which were deconsolidated in May 2016.

Productivity and Reinvestment

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded charges of $165 million and $352 million, respectively, related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. The Company also recorded charges of $368 million and $691 million during the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. These productivity and reinvestment initiatives are focused on four key areas: restructuring the Company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget principles across the organization; streamlining and simplifying the Company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing investments. The savings realized from the program will enable the Company to fund marketing initiatives and innovation required to deliver sustainable net revenue growth. The savings will also support margin expansion and increased returns on invested capital over time.

Equity Investees

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded net charges of $26 million and $61 million, respectively. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded net charges of $8 million and $87 million, respectively. These amounts represent the Company’s proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.

Transaction Gains/Losses

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded charges of $127 million and $297 million, respectively, related to costs incurred to refranchise certain of our bottling operations.

Transaction Gains/Losses (continued)

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the owners of the majority interest of a Brazilian bottler exercised their option to acquire from us a 10 percent interest in the entity's outstanding shares resulting in our recognizing an estimated loss of $32 million due to the exercise price being lower than our carrying value. The transaction closed in January 2015, and the Company recorded an additional loss of $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, calculated based on the final option price. Also during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a loss of $19 million on our previously held investment in a South African bottler, which had been accounted for under the equity method of accounting prior to our acquisition of the bottler in February 2015.

Other Items

Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges

The Company uses derivatives as economic hedges primarily to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.

The Company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of income. We believe this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our economic hedging activities. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the net impact of the Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities resulted in decreases of $56 million and $138 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP income before income taxes. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, the net impact of the Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities described above resulted in a decrease of $52 million and an increase of $24 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP income before income taxes.

Donations to The Coca-Cola Foundation

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded charges of $100 million and $200 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded charges of $100 million. These charges were due to contributions the Company made to The Coca-Cola Foundation.

Devaluation of the Egyptian Pound

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $72 million as a result of remeasuring its net monetary assets denominated in Egyptian pounds.

Other

Other Items (continued)

Hyperinflationary Economies

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $76 million due to the write-down related to receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela as a result of the continued lack of liquidity and our revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to realize upon the conversion of the Venezuelan bolivar into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our receivables.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded net charges of $138 million related to our Venezuelan operations. These charges were primarily a result of the remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the SIMADI exchange rate, an impairment of a Venezuelan trademark due to higher exchange rates, and a write-down of receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela. The write-down was recorded primarily as a result of the continued lack of liquidity and our revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to realize upon the conversion of the Venezuelan bolivar into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our receivables.

Early Extinguishment of Long-Term Debt

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded charges of $320 million due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt.

Certain Tax Matters

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a net tax charge of $1 million and a net tax benefit of $5 million, respectively, related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties.

2017 OUTLOOK

Our 2017 outlook for organic revenues, comparable currency neutral income before taxes (structurally adjusted) and comparable EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, and the impact of structural items, as applicable. We are not able to reconcile our full year 2017 projected organic revenues to our full year 2017 projected reported net revenues, our full year 2017 projected comparable currency neutral income before taxes (structurally adjusted) to our full year 2017 projected reported income before taxes, or our full year 2017 projected comparable EPS to our full year 2017 projected EPS without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the exact timing of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes throughout 2017. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our full year 2017 GAAP financial results.
