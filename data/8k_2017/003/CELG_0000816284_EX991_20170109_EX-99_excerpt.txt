 RESULTS and 2017 Financial GUIDANCE 

-  Preliminary 2016 Unaudited Financial Results Including Net Product Sales and Diluted EPS 

-  Raising 2017 Guidance for Total Revenue and Diluted EPS  

-  Reaffirming 2020 Total Revenue and Adjusted Diluted EPS Financial Targets 

SUMMIT, NJ – (January 9, 2017) – Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) today provided a business update as well as its preliminary 2016 unaudited results and financial guidance for 2017 at the 35th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. In 2017, total revenue is expected to be approximately $13.0 billion to $13.4 billion, an 18 percent increase year-over-year, based on the mid-point of the range. The negative impact of foreign exchange on total revenue is expected to be approximately $170 million in 2017. For the full-year 2017, REVLIMID® net sales are expected to be in the range of $8.0 billion to $8.3 billion.  

Based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the full-year 2017 is expected to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.21, excluding the impact of any strategic transactions, impairments and loss contingencies that have not yet occurred. For the full-year 2017, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.25, a 21 percent increase year-over-year, based on the mid-point of the range. 

“In 2016, we made exceptional progress strengthening and growing our franchises while accelerating and adding to our robust pipeline; our significant business momentum supports raising our 2017 guidance,” said Mark J. Alles, Chief Executive Officer of Celgene. “We are entering a pivotal two-year period with multiple catalysts increasing our confidence in our ability to achieve or exceed our 2020 targets and sustain our growth from 2020 to 2030.” 

Preliminary 2016 Financial Results Year-Over-Year (Unaudited) 

 ·Total net product sales are expected to be approximately $11,187 million, up 22 percent year-over-year.

 ·GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 28 percent, an increase from 24 percent in the prior year, primarily due to increased product sales. Full-year 2016 GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.43 to $2.51, a 27 percent year-over-year increase. 

 ·Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 55 percent for the full year, an increase of 290 basis points (bps) year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be approximately $5.94, a 26 percent year-over-year increase. 

Certain activities involved in determining the audited results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 are in-process and could result in the final reported audited results being different from the unaudited results noted in this press release. Additionally, please see the attached Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation of Estimated/Projected GAAP to Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Measures for further information relevant to the interpretation of adjusted financial measures and reconciliations of these adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, respectively, for each of 2016 and 2017.

Forward-Looking Statement 

This press release contains forward-looking statements, which are generally statements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the words "expects," "anticipates," "believes," "intends," "estimates," "plans," "will," “outlook” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current plans, estimates, assumptions and projections, and speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in light of new information or future events, except as otherwise required by law. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond our control. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of the impact of a number of factors, many of which are discussed in more detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this document also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures based on management’s view of performance including: 

 ·Adjusted operating margin 

 ·Adjusted earnings per share 

Management uses such measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the Company. We believe these adjusted financial measures provide useful and meaningful information to us and investors because they enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and facilitate the comparison of performance between past and future periods. These adjusted financial measures are non-GAAP measures and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When preparing these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures we typically exclude certain GAAP items that management does not consider to be normal, recurring, cash operating expenses but that may not meet the definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Other companies may define these measures in different ways. The following categories of items are excluded from adjusted financial results: 

Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Costs: We exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with business combinations and divestitures from our adjusted financial results that are either non-cash or not normal, recurring operating expenses due to their nature, variability of amounts, and lack of predictability as to occurrence and/or timing. These amounts may include non-cash items such as the amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to 

inventories, intangible asset impairment charges and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of contingent consideration. We also exclude transaction and certain other cash costs associated with business acquisitions and divestitures that are not normal recurring operating expenses, including severance costs which are not part of a formal restructuring program. 

Share-based Compensation Expense: We exclude share-based compensation from our adjusted financial results because share-based compensation expense, which is non-cash, fluctuates from period to period based on factors that are not within our control, such as our stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued. 

Collaboration-related Upfront Expenses: We exclude collaboration-related upfront expenses from our adjusted financial results because we do not consider them to be normal, recurring operating expenses due to their nature, variability of amounts, and lack of predictability as to occurrence and/or timing. Upfront payments to collaboration partners are made at the commencement of a relationship anticipated to continue for a multi-year period and provide us with intellectual property rights, option rights and other rights with respect to particular programs. The variability of amounts and lack of predictability of collaboration-related upfront expenses makes the identification of trends in our ongoing research and development activities more difficult. We believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding collaboration-related upfront expenses, provides useful and meaningful information about our ongoing research and development activities by enhancing investors’ understanding of our normal, recurring operating research and development expenses and facilitates comparisons between periods and with respect to projected performance. All expenses incurred subsequent to the initiation of the collaboration arrangement, such as research and development cost-sharing expenses/reimbursements and milestone payments up to the point of regulatory approval are considered to be normal, recurring operating expenses and are included in our adjusted financial results. 

Research and Development Asset Acquisition Expense: We exclude costs associated with acquiring rights to pre-commercial compounds because we do not consider such costs to be normal, recurring operating expenses due to their nature, variability of amounts, and lack of predictability as to occurrence and/or timing. Research and development asset acquisition expenses includes expenses to acquire rights to pre-commercial compounds from a collaboration partner when there will be no further participation from the collaboration partner or other parties. The variability of amounts and lack of predictability of research and development asset acquisition expenses makes the identification of trends in our ongoing research and development activities more difficult. We believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding research and development asset acquisition expenses, provides useful and meaningful information about our ongoing research and development activities by enhancing investors’ understanding of our normal, recurring operating research and development expenses and facilitates comparisons between periods and with respect to projected performance. 

Restructuring Costs: We exclude costs associated with restructuring initiatives from our adjusted financial results. These costs include amounts associated with facilities to be closed, employee separation costs and costs to move operations from one location to another. We do not frequently undertake restructuring initiatives and therefore do not consider such costs to be normal, recurring operating expenses. 

Certain Other Items: We exclude certain other significant items that may occur occasionally and are not normal, recurring, cash operating expenses from our adjusted financial results. Such items are evaluated on an individual basis based on both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their nature and generally represent items that, either as a result of their nature or magnitude, we would not anticipate occurring as part of our normal business on a regular basis. While not all-inclusive, examples of certain 

other significant items excluded from adjusted financial results would be: expenses for significant fair value adjustments to equity investments, significant litigation-related loss contingency accruals and expenses to settle other disputed matters. 

Estimated Tax Impact From Above Adjustments: We exclude the net income tax impact of the non-tax adjustments described above from our adjusted financial results. The net income tax impact of the non-tax adjustments includes the impact on both current and deferred income taxes and is based on the taxability of the adjustment under local tax law and the statutory tax rate in the tax jurisdiction where the adjustment was incurred. 

Non-Operating Tax Adjustments: We exclude the net income tax impact of certain other significant income tax items, which are not associated with our normal, recurring operations (“Non-Operating Tax Items”), from our adjusted financial results. Non-Operating Tax Items include items which may occur occasionally and are not normal, recurring operating expenses (or benefits), including adjustments related to acquisitions, divestitures, collaborations, certain adjustments to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions, and other similar items. 

Long-Term Targets 

A reconciliation of long-term adjusted financial targets to the most comparable GAAP measures cannot be provided because we are unable to forecast with reasonable certainty many of the items necessary to calculate such comparable GAAP measures, including share-based compensation expense, collaboration-related upfront expense, research and development asset acquisition expense, acquisition-related expenses, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings and unusual gains and losses, as well as unforeseen events, risks and developments. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe the inherent uncertainties in reconciling our long-term non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures would make the forecasted comparable GAAP measures nearly impossible to predict with reasonable certainty and therefore inherently unreliable. 

See the attached Reconciliation of Estimated/Projected GAAP to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Measures for explanations of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at the adjusted measures for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and for the projected amounts for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2017.
