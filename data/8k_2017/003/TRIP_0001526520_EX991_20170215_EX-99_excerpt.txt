TripAdvisor Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Financial Results  

NEEDHAM, MA, February 15, 2017 — TripAdvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRIP) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016.  

“2016 was an important transition year and one of great progress towards creating the best user experience in travel,” said Chief Executive Officer Steve Kaufer. “We rolled out hotel instant booking globally and strengthened our position in Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals. With our price comparison and booking capabilities in place, we are focused on raising consumer awareness of TripAdvisor as a great place to go to price shop and book.” 

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Summary

SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

TripAdvisor, Inc.  

Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  

(in millions, except per share amounts)  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(2)  

During the fourth quarter of December 31, 2015, TripAdvisor made a non-cash contribution of $67 million to settle our pledge obligation with The TripAdvisor Charitable Foundation (the “Foundation”). This resulted in $59 million ($36 million after-tax) of incremental charitable contribution expense for both the quarter ended and the year ended December 31, 2015, which did not reoccur in 2016. This amount was settled in TripAdvisor’s common stock. TripAdvisor does not expect to make any future contributions to the Foundation. 

(3)  

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, the Company recorded a $3 million and $20 million gain from a sale of a subsidiary in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016.

In the third quarter of 2016, TripAdvisor early adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to reclassify excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation from operating to financing activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. The retrospective application to prior periods resulted in a $4 million and $36 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities during the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, and a corresponding increase in cash flows used in financing activities.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP in our press release and related conference call or webcast, we also report certain non-GAAP financial measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company’s financial statements. We use the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, free cash flow, non-GAAP revenue before effects of foreign exchange, and Adjusted EBITDA before effects of foreign exchange.  

The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of TripAdvisor’s liquidity. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, many of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of certain items, as defined in our non-GAAP definitions below, which are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even where similarly titled, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes and therefore should not be used to compare TripAdvisor’s performance to that of other companies. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP financial measures.  

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management to operate and analyze our business over different periods of time. 

We define our non-GAAP financial measures as below: 

TripAdvisor defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as Net Income (loss) plus: (1) provision for income taxes; (2) other income (expense), net; (3) depreciation of property and equipment, including amortization of internal use software and website development; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) stock-based compensation and other stock-settled obligations; (6) goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible asset impairments; and (7) other non-recurring expenses and income. These items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount is not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. 

TripAdvisor defines “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.  

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the operating performance of our business, as a whole and our individual business segments, and on which internal budgets and forecasts are based and approved. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors and allows for another useful comparison of our performance with our historical results from prior periods.  

Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other GAAP results.  

Some of these limitations are:  

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;  

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation or other stock-settled obligations;  

9 

•  

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;  

•  

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and  

•  

Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.  

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP net income” as GAAP net income excluding, net of their related tax effects: (1) stock-based compensation expense and other stock-settled obligations; (2) amortization of intangible assets; (3) certain gains, losses, and other expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating results; (4) goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible asset impairments and (5) other non-recurring expenses and income. We believe non-GAAP net income is an operating performance measure which provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, as it incorporates our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of certain expenses, infrequently occurring items and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, and also enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance.  

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP net income per diluted share”, or non-GAAP diluted EPS, as non-GAAP net income divided by GAAP diluted shares. We believe non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, interest income, income taxes and foreign exchange gains or losses, but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. During the second quarter of 2016, TripAdvisor began calculating non-GAAP net income per diluted share using GAAP diluted shares determined under the treasury stock method. This change did not have a material effect on our previously reported non-GAAP EPS calculations in prior periods. 

Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS have some of the same limitations as Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, non-GAAP net income does not include all items that affect our net income and GAAP diluted EPS for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

TripAdvisor defines “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which are purchases of property and equipment, including capitalization of internal-use software development costs. We believe this financial measure can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business, as it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate free cash flow along with the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 

TripAdvisor calculates our foreign exchange effect of revenue or, “non-GAAP revenue before effects of foreign exchange” on a constant currency basis by excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange on revenue by translating actual revenue for the current year three months ended using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates. We believe this is a useful measure that facilitates management's internal comparison to our historical performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of our core operating results. 

TripAdvisor calculates our foreign exchange effect of Adjusted EBITDA or, “Adjusted EBITDA before effects of foreign exchange,” on a constant currency basis, by excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange by translating all amounts included in Adjusted EBITDA for the current year three months ended using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates. We believe this is a useful measure that facilitates management's internal comparison to our historical performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of our core operating results. 

Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, we present reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure below.

(1)  

TripAdvisor defines “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. 

(2)  

Represents a non-cash charitable contribution to the Foundation of $67 million that was settled in company stock and therefore added back for non-GAAP purposes, of which $6 million was accrued during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 under GAAP with the intention of settling in cash and then reclassified as non-GAAP expense during the fourth quarter of 2015 to reflect the non-cash nature of the final settlement. 

(3)  

The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments was calculated based on the individual impact that these items had on our GAAP consolidated income tax expense for the periods presented.  

(4)  

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP net income per diluted share” as non-GAAP net income divided by GAAP diluted shares. During the second quarter of 2016, TripAdvisor began calculating non-GAAP net income per diluted share using GAAP diluted shares determined under the treasury stock method. All historical periods have been conformed to the current calculation method. This change did not have a material effect on our previously reported non-GAAP net income per diluted share calculations in any prior period. 

(5)  

In the third quarter of 2016, TripAdvisor early adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to reclassify excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation from operating to financing activities in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. The retrospective application to prior periods resulted in a $4 million and $36 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities during the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, and a corresponding increase in cash flows used in financing activities. In addition, this resulted in an increase in free cash flow of $4 million and $36 million during the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

(6)  

Represents constant currency growth, as a percentage, which is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues and Adjusted EBITDA over prior period revenues and Adjusted EBITDA, where current period figures are translated using prior period foreign currency exchange rates.
