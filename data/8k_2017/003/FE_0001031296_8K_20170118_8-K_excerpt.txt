Item 8.01 Other Events

Sale of Gas and Hydroelectric Units

FirstEnergy today announced that AE Supply and AGC have entered into a purchase agreement dated as of January 18, 2017, to sell four of AE Supply’s natural gas generating plants in Pennsylvania and approximately 59% of AGC’s interests in a Virginia hydroelectric power station to Aspen Generating, LLC (Aspen), a wholly-owned subsidiary of LS Power Equity Partners III, LP. Under the terms of the agreement, the facilities would be purchased for an all cash purchase price of approximately $925 million. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017 subject to various customary and other closing conditions, including, without limitation, receipt of regulatory approvals, third party consents and the satisfaction and discharge of AE Supply’s senior note indenture, under which there is approximately $305 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. There can be no assurance that any such approvals will be obtained and/or any such conditions will be satisfied or that such sale will be consummated. Further, the satisfaction and discharge of AE Supply’s senior note indenture in connection with the closing is expected to require the payment of a “make-whole” premium calculated just prior to the redemption, which based on current interest rates is approximately $100 million. It is expected that proceeds from the sale will be invested in the unregulated money pool and may be used for the repayment of debt and general corporate purposes.

As a further condition to closing, FirstEnergy will provide Aspen two limited guaranties of certain obligations of AE Supply and AGC arising under the purchase agreement. The guaranties vary in amount and scope and expire in one and three years, respectively.

The power stations included in the sale have a total capacity of 1,572 megawatts (MW): 

•Bath County Hydro (713 MW pumped-storage hydro) in Warm Springs, Va. (represents AE Supply’s indirect interest)

•Springdale Generating Facility Units 1-5 (638 MW natural gas) in Springdale Township, Pa.

•Chambersburg Generating Facility Units 12-13 (88 MW natural gas) in Guildford Township, Pa.

•Gans Generating Facility Units 8-9 (88 MW natural gas) in Springhill Township, Pa.

•Hunlock Creek (45 MW natural gas) in Hunlock Creek, Pa.

In November, FirstEnergy announced its strategy to be a fully regulated utility focusing on stable and predictable earnings and cash flow from its regulated business units. In order to execute on this strategy, FirstEnergy previously disclosed it had begun a strategic review of its competitive operations focused on the sale of gas and hydroelectric units as well as exploring all alternatives for the remaining generation assets at its Competitive Energy Services segment. The pending asset sale is consistent with FirstEnergy’s strategy of operating as a fully regulated utility company. On January 19, 2017, officers of FirstEnergy determined that FirstEnergy will recognize a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of approximately $266 million associated with these power stations in its consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.

A copy of the news release issued by the Company announcing the agreement to sell the gas and hydroelectric units is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

As a result, the companies will receive the following overall annual rate increases:

PN $100 million; and

The new rates will be effective January 27, 2017.

our ability to improve electric commodity margins and the impact of, among other factors, the increased cost of fuel and fuel transportation on such margins; changing market conditions that could affect the measurement of certain liabilities and the value of assets held in our Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts, pension trusts and other trust funds, and cause us and/or our subsidiaries to make additional contributions sooner, or in amounts that are larger than currently anticipated;

Dividends declared from time to time on FirstEnergy Corp.'s common stock during any period may in the aggregate vary from prior periods due to circumstances considered by FirstEnergy Corp.'s Board of Directors at the time of the actual declarations. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor assess the impact of any such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
