On February 22, 2017, Marathon Oil Corporation (“MRO” or the “Company”) appointed Dane E. Whitehead as executive vice president and Chief Financial Officer, with an anticipated effective date of March 6, 2017 (“Effective Date”).

Mr. Whitehead, 55, has most recently served as executive vice president and Chief Financial Officer of both EP Energy Corporation and EP Energy LLC since May 2012. He was senior vice president of Strategy and Enterprise Business Development and a member of El Paso Corporation’s executive committee from 2009 to 2012. He joined El Paso Exploration & Production Company as senior vice president and Chief Financial Officer in 2006. Prior to that, Whitehead was vice president, controller and chief accounting officer of Burlington Resources Inc., and formerly senior vice president and CFO of Burlington Resources Canada. Mr. Whitehead began his career as an independent accountant with Coopers and Lybrand. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting from the University of Washington, and is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Mr. Whitehead has no family relationship with any executive officer or director of MRO reportable under Item 401(d) of Regulation S-K. 

As executive vice president and CFO, Mr. Whitehead will receive a base salary of $575,000 per year. He will participate in both the Company’s annual (i) cash bonus program with a target award of 85% of base salary and (ii) long-term incentive awards program with a target value of $2,200,000. Mr. Whitehead will also receive a sign-on grant of (i) Company restricted stock with an intended value of $2,400,000 and (ii) stock options with an intended value of $500,000, each of which will be granted as soon as administratively feasible after he has commenced employment, and will vest pro-rata over three years. Additionally, Mr. Whitehead will receive a cash sign-on bonus of $1,270,000 within 30 days of commencing employment. All of this cash sign-on bonus must be repaid if he resigns before the first anniversary of his commencement of employment, and 50% must be repaid if he resigns before the second anniversary of his commencement of employment.
