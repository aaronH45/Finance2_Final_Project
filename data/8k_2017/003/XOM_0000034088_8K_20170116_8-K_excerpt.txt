Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Securities 

On January 16, 2017, an affiliate of the Corporation entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) to acquire companies owned by the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, that indirectly own certain oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin and certain additional properties and related assets in exchange for issuance to the sellers of shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation Common Stock having an aggregate value at the time of closing of $5.6 billion, together with additional contingent cash payments tied to future drilling and completion activities (up to a maximum of $1.02 billion). The number of shares of the Corporation’s common stock for this purpose will be determined based on the Corporation’s volume-weighted average trading price over a 10-day period ending on the third trading date immediately preceding the closing date. The transaction is currently expected to close on or about February 28, 2017. As of January 16, 2017, the number of shares issuable in connection with the transaction would have been approximately 63 million. The sale of shares under the PSA has been structured as a private placement solely to accredited investors and therefore the Corporation is relying on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.
