 Forward-Looking Statements

 This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as Illumina’s expectations regarding the shipment dates of NovaSeq products.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update these forward-looking statements, to review or confirm analysts’ expectations, or to provide interim reports or updates on the progress of the current quarter.
