“Our results for the 2016 fourth quarter were impacted by lower-than-anticipated volume growth in both our physician services and medical transportation segments, which we have taken into account when developing our outlook for 2017. We remain committed to achieving operational excellence at Envision, and we are excited about the opportunities to grow this organization. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed three Physician Services acquisitions in anesthesia and neonatology. During the first quarter of 2017, we have completed four acquisitions in anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology and ambulatory services. These transactions, as well as our ongoing discussions with healthcare providers and health systems, validate the strong market positioning and potential Envision has as an integrated and scaled national provider across a broad continuum of clinical network solutions.” 

Following completion of the Merger, Envision is reporting its results for three segments: Physician Services, which includes AMSURG’s legacy Sheridan Healthcare and EHH’s legacy EmCare and Evolution Health, Medical Transportation and Ambulatory Services. 

Physician Services 

Net revenues for physician services were $865.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, which compares with $378.1 million for the prior-year period. Physician services revenue growth was driven by the inclusion of one month of physician services revenue from EHH of $347.9 million as a result of the Merger. Excluding the one month of results from EHH, Physician Services revenues grew by 37.0%, which consisted of acquisition growth of 34.3%, new contract growth of 1.9% and contribution of 0.8% from services provided at existing contracts. 

When calculated on a same-contract basis, which excludes the impact of EHH, Physician Services net revenue grew by 2.3%, day adjusted, and included 0.3% volume growth, and 2.0% growth in revenue per patient encounter. Same-contract volume growth was impacted by a lower rate of growth in anesthesia services in specific markets as well as a high prior-year comparable growth rate. 

Adjusted EBITDA of $120.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased from $74.1 million for the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA includes $32.9 million from EHH’s Physician Services as a result of the Merger. 

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, Physician Services generated net revenues of $2.23 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $366.3 million. 

AMSURG’s legacy Physician Services had 6.3% same-contract growth for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of 3.7% related to patient volume and 2.6% due to rate. EHH’s legacy Physician Services had same-contract growth of 6.4% during 2016, which consisted of 3.3% growth from volume and 3.1% from rate. EHH’s same-contract growth includes supplemental results from EHH prior to the completion of the Merger.

Medical Transportation 

Envision’s Medical Transportation segment information, which reflects results from AMR, generated net revenues of $198.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $24.6 million for the month of December 2016. 

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, Medical Transportation’s same-market revenue for the Medical Transportation segment increased by 2.8% in 2016, which was comprised of volume growth of 2.9% and a 0.1% decline attributable to rate. Medical Transportation's same-market growth includes supplemental results from prior to the completion of the Merger.

Ambulatory Services 

Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $326.7 million, which compares with $326.2 million for the prior-year period. Same-center revenue increased by 3.4%, day adjusted, for the fourth quarter of 2016, which was comprised of 0.6% increase in procedure volume and a 2.8% increase in net revenue per procedure. Net revenue growth was impacted by centers that were deconsolidated since the fourth quarter of 2015. Deconsolidated centers contributed incremental revenues of $8.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.

Ambulatory Services generated Adjusted EBITDA of $63.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which compares to $63.3 million for the prior-year period. 

For 2016, Ambulatory Services generated revenue of $1.27 billion, an increase of 3.1% from 2015. Adjusted EBITDA of $240.1 million in 2016 grew by 6.1% from $226.2 million in 2015. 

Ambulatory Services operated 260 ASCs and one surgical hospital at December 31, 2016. Ambulatory Services added one de novo center and disposed of one center during the quarter. 

Liquidity 

Envision had cash and cash equivalents of $331.6 million and availability of $677.3 million under its asset-based lending facility as of December 31, 2016. Net cash flows from operations, less distributions to noncontrolling interests and excluding transaction costs, were $293.0 million for 2016. The Company’s ratio of total debt at December 31, 2016, to trailing 12 months EBITDA as calculated under the Company’s credit agreement was 4.3 times. 

Exploration of Strategic Options

Envision is also announcing that it will explore strategic options for its American Medical Response (AMR) business and Evolution Health population health management services. Those options include potential joint ventures, other alternative structures or possible divestiture. AMR is the nation’s largest medical transportation provider with more than 4.5 million annual patient transports. Evolution Health is a population health management and post-acute, home health and hospice provider. 

Guidance  

Envision today established its financial and operating guidance for 2017 and the first quarter of the year. The Company’s guidance is as follows: 

•Net revenues of $10.4 billion to $10.7 billion; 

•Same-contract revenue growth for Physician Services of 3% to 4%; 

•Same-center revenue growth for Medical Transportation of 2% to 3%; 

•Same-center revenue growth for Ambulatory Services of 2% to 3%; 

•Adjusted EBITDA of $1.365 billion to $1.415 billion; 

•Adjusted EPS for 2017 $4.06 to $4.31; and 

•For the first quarter of 2017, Adjusted EPS of $0.75 to $0.81, which includes the expected impact of seasonally higher payroll tax expenses in Physician Services.

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year of 2017 excludes interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, impairment charges, debt extinguishment costs, transaction and integration costs, changes in contingent purchase price consideration, gain or loss on deconsolidations and discontinued operations. Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2017 excludes acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, acquisition-related amortization expense, gains and losses on future deconsolidation transactions, share-based compensation, impairment charges and debt extinguishment costs, net of tax impact. Envision is not providing a reconciliation of its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS guidance because the exact amount of such exclusions are not currently determinable. These amounts may be significant and may vary significantly from period to period (see page 6 for a reconciliation of all historical GAAP and non-GAAP financial results).

Conference Call Information 

Envision will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today to discuss its financial results.

Projected Adjusted EBITDA

For informational purposes only, and to assist investors in evaluating the operations of EHH and AMSURG compared to previously issued guidance, we are providing projected adjusted EBITDA results for both EHH and AMSURG on a standalone basis for the year ended December 31, 2016, assuming the Merger had not occurred. The results of both EHH and AMSURG are projected results due to the Merger of EHH and AMSURG on December 1, 2016. The projected adjusted EBITDA results for EHH do not include the impact of preliminary adjustments that resulted from changes in estimates made by management of the Company, which related primarily to differences in estimation methodologies. As a result of these adjustments, EHH has recorded certain changes in estimates of approximately $83.6 million and $44.5 million associated with its physician services and medical transportation segments, respectively. In addition, certain shared costs of the Company have been allocated across the segments of the Company during the post-acquisition period, which may differ from the allocation utilized by the pre-merger entities. These changes in estimates were not contemplated in the legacy EHH guidance. The Company has not finalized its purchase price allocation and, therefore, these changes in estimates are subject to further adjustment upon finalization of this process. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)A reconciliation of the projected adjusted EBITDA, a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, of EHH and AMSURG to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of the Company is omitted from this release because the Company is unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable effort. This inability results from the inherent difficulty in reconciling forecasted results of the pre-merged entities to that of the Company post merger. In particular, sufficient information is not available to calculate certain adjustments required for such reconciliation without unreasonable effort, including interest expense, net; provision for (benefit from) income taxes; other non-cash expenses, net; other changes in operating assets and liabilities and other adjustments that would be necessary to prepare a forward-looking statement of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.

Footnotes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP Measures

(1) We believe the calculation of adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to Envision Healthcare Corporation common shareholders provides a better measure of our ongoing performance and provides better comparability to prior periods because it excludes discontinued operations, the gains or loss from deconsolidations, which are non-cash in nature, impairment charges, transaction and integration costs, including associated debt extinguishment costs and deferred financing write-off, and acquisition-related amortization expense, changes in contingent purchase price consideration, purchase accounting adjustments related to mergers and acquisitions and share-based compensation expense. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to Envision Healthcare Corporation common shareholders should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the items excluded from it is a significant component in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to Envision Healthcare Corporation common shareholders is not a measurement determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable as presented to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For purposes of calculating adjusted earnings per share, we utilize the if-converted method to determine the number of diluted shares outstanding. In periods where utilizing the if-converted method is anti-dilutive, the mandatory convertible preferred stock will not be included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding.

(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA of AmSurg as earnings before interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, transaction and integration costs, share-based compensation, impairment charges, debt extinguishment costs, gain or loss on deconsolidations, changes in contingent purchase price consideration, purchase accounting adjustments related to mergers and acquisitions and discontinued operations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is an analytical indicator used by management and the health care industry to evaluate company performance, allocate resources and measure leverage and debt service capacity. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows from operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Envision Healthcare Corporation common shareholders is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is most comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as defined.
