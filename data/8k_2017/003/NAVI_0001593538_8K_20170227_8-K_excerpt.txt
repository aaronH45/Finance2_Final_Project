Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements  

Statements in this report that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company’s beliefs, opinions or expectations and statements that assume or are dependent upon future events, are forward-looking statements and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” or “target.” Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. For Navient, these factors include, among others, the risks and uncertainties associated with increases in financing costs or the availability of financing; limits on our liquidity resulting from disruptions in the capital markets or other factors; unanticipated increases in costs associated with compliance with laws and regulations; changes in the marketplaces in which we compete (including changes in demand or changes resulting from new laws and regulations); changes in accounting standards pertaining to loan loss reserves and estimates or other accounting standards that may impact our operations; adverse outcomes in any significant litigation to which the Company is a party; credit risk associated with the Company’s exposure to third parties, including counterparties to the Company’s hedging transactions. The Company could also be affected by, among other things: unanticipated deferrals in our FFELP securitization trusts that would delay repayment of the bonds beyond their legal final maturity date; reductions in our credit ratings, the credit ratings of asset-backed securitizations we sponsor or the credit ratings of the United States of America; failures of our operating systems or infrastructure or those of third-party vendors; risks related to cybersecurity including the potential disruption of our systems or potential disclosure of confidential customer information; damage to our reputation resulting from the politicization of student loan servicing; changes in law and regulations with respect to the student lending business and financial institutions generally; delays or errors in converting portfolio acquisitions to our servicing platform; increased competition from banks and other consumer lenders who are not subject to the same level of regulation, the creditworthiness of our customers; changes in the general interest rate environment, including the relationship between the relevant money-market index rate and the rate at which our assets are priced; changes in general economic conditions and the other factors that are described in the “Risk Factors” section of Navient’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements also requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates or assumptions may prove to be incorrect and actual results could differ materially. All forward-looking statements contained in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this release. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements except as required by law.
