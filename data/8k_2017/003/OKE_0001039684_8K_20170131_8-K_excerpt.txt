 Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement  

On January 31, 2017, ONEOK, Inc. (“ONEOK”), New Holdings Subsidiary, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub”), ONEOK Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“ONEOK Partners”), and ONEOK Partners GP, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of ONEOK Partners (the “ONEOK Partners GP”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into ONEOK Partners with ONEOK Partners surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ONEOK (the “Merger”), in a taxable transaction to unitholders.  

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding common unit of ONEOK Partners (the “ONEOK Partners Common Unit”) (other than ONEOK Partners Common Units held directly or indirectly by ONEOK), will be converted into the right to receive 0.985 (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of ONEOK (the “ONEOK Common Stock”). 

 Each of ONEOK, Merger Sub, ONEOK Partners, and ONEOK Partners GP has made customary representations and warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement also includes, among others, certain pre-closing covenants by ONEOK, ONEOK Partners and ONEOK Partners GP: (a) that ONEOK Partners, ONEOK Partners GP and their respective subsidiaries will conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice, during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger; (b) to convene and hold meetings of ONEOK’s stockholders and ONEOK Partners’ limited partners to approve the Merger; and (c) that, subject to certain exceptions, a special committee (the “Special Committee”) of the board of directors of ONEOK, the board of directors of ONEOK Partners GP and the conflicts committee of the board of directors of ONEOK Partners GP will recommend that their stockholders and limited partners, respectively, approve the issuance of ONEOK Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the “ ONEOK Stock Issuance”) or the Merger, respectively. The Merger Agreement provides that ONEOK will not take certain actions that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the Merger, including soliciting any proposals or offer to acquire more than 25% of ONEOK that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the Merger.  

The Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including but not limited to (i) approval of the ONEOK Stock Issuance by at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares of ONEOK Common Stock voting on the matter, (ii) approval of the Merger Agreement by at least a majority of the outstanding ONEOK Partners Common Units and Class B units of ONEOK Partners, voting as a single class, (iii) the absence of any statute, rule, order, decree or regulation prohibiting the Merger, (iv) the approval for listing of ONEOK Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, (v) the effectiveness under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of a registration statement covering the ONEOK Common Stock, (vi) receipt by ONEOK of an opinion to the effect that the Merger should not be treated as a transaction governed by Section 351(a) of the internal revenue code, (vii) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties, and (viii) each party’s compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement. 

The parties have also agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other and respond to and comply promptly with any requests for information with respect to antitrust and competition laws.  

The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, including, among others, (i) by ONEOK or ONEOK Partners, if the Merger is not consummated by September 30, 2017, (ii) by ONEOK, if the board of directors of ONEOK Partners GP or the conflicts committee takes certain actions with respect to its recommendation of the Merger prior to the partnership unitholder meeting, and (iii) by ONEOK Partners, if the Special Committee takes certain actions with respect to its recommendation of the ONEOK Stock Issuance prior to the ONEOK stockholder meeting. The Merger Agreement further provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement by ONEOK under certain circumstances, ONEOK Partners must pay ONEOK a termination fee (up to, in certain instances, $300 million), and upon termination of the Merger Agreement by ONEOK Partners under certain circumstances, ONEOK must pay ONEOK Partners a termination fee (up to, in certain instances, $300 million). 

The Merger Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference. The foregoing summary has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about ONEOK, ONEOK Partners or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by each of the parties to the Merger Agreement, which were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions  

 thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of ONEOK, ONEOK Partners or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in ONEOK’s or ONEOK Partners’ public disclosures.
