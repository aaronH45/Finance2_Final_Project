Notes on non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures N O T E S Notes on non-GAAP financial measures 1. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results, including the overhead ratio and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These non-GAAP financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 48 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (“2016 Form 10-K”). 2. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense/(benefit) of $(317) million and $3.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenues. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 50 of the Firm’s 2016 Form 10-K. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $64.06 and $60.46 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. 4. Net charge-off (“NCO”) rates exclude purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; this is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of the NCO rates, including the impact of PCI loans, see page 55-56 of the 2016 Form 10-K. Notes on key performance measures 5. Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the Basel III Fully Phased-In capital rules, to which the Firm will be subject commencing January 1, 2019, are considered key regulatory capital measures. In the case of the SLR, the Fully Phased-In minimum ratio is effective beginning January 1, 2018. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Capital Risk Management on pages 76-85 of the 2016 Form 10-K. 6. Core loans are also considered a key performance measure. Core loans represent loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; and exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. Core loans are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing actual growth in the loan portfolio. 37

Notes appendix Page 1 1. The “% of 10-year JPMAM long-term mutual fund AUM outperform peers” analysis represents the proportion of assets in mutual funds that are ranked in the top 2 quartiles of their respective peer category on a 10-year basis as of December 31, 2016. All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from Lipper for the U.S. and Taiwan domiciled funds; Morningstar for the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong domiciled funds; Nomura for Japan domiciled funds and FundDoctor for South Korea domiciled funds. Includes only Asset Management retail open-ended mutual funds that are ranked by the aforementioned sources. Excludes money market funds, Undiscovered Managers Fund, and Brazil and India domiciled funds. Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers redenominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to “Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Page 3 1. The “% of 2016 JPMAM long-term mutual fund AUM over peer median” analysis represents the proportion of assets in mutual funds that are ranked above their respective peer category median on 1, 3, 5, and 10 year basis as of December 31, 2016. All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from Lipper for the U.S. and Taiwan domiciled funds; Morningstar for the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong domiciled funds; Nomura for Japan domiciled funds and FundDoctor for South Korea domiciled funds. Includes only Asset Management retail open-ended mutual funds that are ranked by the aforementioned sources.
