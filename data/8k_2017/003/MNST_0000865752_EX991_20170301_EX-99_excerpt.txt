Corona, CA – March 1, 2017 – Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. 

2016 Fourth Quarter 

Net sales for the 2016 fourth quarter increased 16.8 percent to $753.8 million, from $645.4 million in the same period last year. Gross sales for the 2016 fourth quarter increased 14.2 percent to $848.8 million, from $743.2 million in the same period last year. Comparative net and gross sales amounts for the 2015 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by the Company’s customers due to a pre-announced price increase, effective August 31, 2015 (“Advance Purchases”), on certain of the Company’s Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. The Company estimates that net and gross sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were reduced by approximately $11.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, as a result of such Advance Purchases. Net and gross sales for the 2016 fourth quarter, after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparatives for Advance Purchases, increased by 14.8 percent and 12.4 percent, respectively. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.3 million and gross sales by approximately $5.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. 

Net sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which is comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, as well as Mutant® Super Soda drinks, increased 17.0 percent to $684.4 million for the 2016 fourth quarter, from $585.1 million for the same period last year. Net sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola

Company, increased 6.9 percent to $64.5 million for the 2016 fourth quarter, from $60.4 million in the comparable 2015 quarter. Net sales for the Company’s Other segment, which includes certain products of American Fruits & Flavors sold to independent third parties, were $4.7 million for the 2016 fourth quarter. There were no net sales for the Other segment for the 2015 fourth quarter. 

Net sales to customers outside the United States rose to $193.5 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, from $145.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2016 fourth quarter, increased to 66.1 percent from 62.5 percent for the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. 

Operating expenses for the 2016 fourth quarter were $246.4 million, compared with $174.9 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Included in operating expenses were distributor termination expenses of $46.3 million and $3.3 million for the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters, respectively. 

Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2 percent for the 2016 fourth quarter, the same as in the 2015 fourth quarter. 

Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2016 fourth quarter were 12.0 percent, compared with 12.9 percent in the 2015 fourth quarter. 

General and administrative expenses for the 2016 fourth quarter were $132.2 million or 17.5 percent of net sales, compared with $70.9 million, or 11.0 percent of net sales, for the comparable 2015 fourth quarter.

Operating income for the 2016 fourth quarter increased 10.2 percent to $251.7 million, from $228.4 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. 

The effective tax rate for the 2016 fourth quarter was 29.9 percent, compared with 39.5 percent in the same period last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due in part to an increase in the domestic production deduction as well as an increase in the stock compensation deduction due to the adoption of new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016, under which excess tax benefits are recorded in net income. These excess tax benefits were previously recorded in additional paid-in-capital. The amount of excess tax benefits recorded in income for the 2016 fourth quarter was $13.7 million. 

Net income for the 2016 fourth quarter increased 24.7 percent to $172.9 million, from $138.7 million in the same period last year. Net income per diluted share for the 2016 fourth quarter increased 32.6 percent to $0.30, from $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company estimates that distributor termination expenses in the 2016 fourth quarter of $46.3 million reduced reported diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 per share, after tax. There was no diluted earnings per share impact of distributor termination expenses, after tax, in the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. 

Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: “We are pleased to report continued progress on the strategic alignment of our distribution system with Coca-Cola bottlers, both domestically and internationally. In the United States, we continue to see improvements in the quality of our distribution, particularly in the food service channel, and we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy® drinks to the

Coca-Cola bottlers in Wisconsin early in January 2017. We transitioned distribution of Monster Energy® drinks to the Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as in certain other countries during the 2016 fourth quarter. In China, we continued with launches in Shanghai, Hunan Province, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang and Hainan in the quarter. Further launches are planned throughout 2017 in China. We also launched Monster Energy® drinks in Nigeria early in 2017 and are planning further launches of Monster Energy® drinks in other countries in 2017, including a relaunch in India. We launched Mutant®, our new Super Soda drinks, in certain convenience store chains in late September 2016 and continue to see encouraging early results. We are planning for additional distribution of Mutant® in 2017. Our 2016 fourth quarter results were impacted by distributor terminations and the strength of the United States dollar,” Sacks added.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Measures 

Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect

of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.
