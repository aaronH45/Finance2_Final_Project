Baker Hughes Announces Fourth Quarter and Annual Results

•Revenue of $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 2% sequentially. Full-year revenue was $9.8 billion

•GAAP net loss attributable to Baker Hughes of $417 million for the quarter includes the negative impact of $291 million of adjusting items and $107 million of income taxes

•Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP measure) was $266 million for the quarter and $493 million for the year

•Cash flows from operating activities were $632 million for the quarter and $4.2 billion for the year

HOUSTON, Texas (January 26, 2017) – Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI) announced today results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016.

“During 2016, against the back-drop of another difficult year for the industry, we achieved significant progress on our commitment to improve financial performance by reducing operational costs, optimizing our capital structure, and strengthening our commercial strategy,” said Martin Craighead, Baker Hughes Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

“In the second half of 2016, we reduced annualized costs by nearly $700 million, exceeding our initial goal by almost 40%, paid down $1 billion in debt, repurchased more than $750 million in shares, accelerated innovation with nearly 70 new product introductions, and built new sales channels for our products and technology. As we executed on an asset-light strategy to strengthen profitability and return on invested capital, we rationalized under-performing product lines in select markets and contributed our North America land pressure pumping business into a new venture that is exceptionally well positioned to participate efficiently and cost-effectively in the growth of this market segment. 

“For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 2% sequentially as a result of increased activity in North America, uplift from better-than-expected seasonal year-end product sales, and pockets of growth internationally, primarily in the Middle East. This was partially offset by reduced activity across the North Sea resulting from labor union strikes, weather delays, and project postponements. This quarter we also achieved a sequential reduction in operating losses, generated $632 million of cash flow from operations, and ended the year with $4.6 billion in cash.

“Looking ahead for the first half of 2017, we expect onshore revenue in North America to increase as our customers ramp up activity, with service pricing improving but limited by overcapacity. Internationally, we are forecasting activity declines and continued pricing pressure, with pockets of growth onshore. In offshore markets, particularly deepwater, activity declines are expected to be more severe. As such, we remain focused on managing our costs and aggressively

identifying revenue opportunities for our products and technology that can help our customers achieve their business objectives.

“In closing, with regard to the pending GE Oil & Gas merger, my excitement about the opportunities this transformative combination will deliver for our customers, shareholders, and employees, and the industry as a whole, has only grown since we announced the transaction in late October. GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes are an exceptional fit, with highly talented teams, similar cultures of innovation, and industry-leading capabilities. The integration planning teams are making good progress, the regulatory review process is proceeding as planned, and we continue to expect a mid-2017 close.”

2016 Full Year Results

Revenue for the year was $9.8 billion, down $5.9 billion, or 37%, compared to $15.7 billion for 2015. This reduction resulted from the steep decline in activity, as evident by the 32% drop in the average rig count, global pricing pressures, and sharply reduced revenue in onshore pressure pumping as we strived to maintain cash flow positive operations. 

On a GAAP basis, net loss attributable to Baker Hughes was $2.7 billion ($6.31 per diluted share), compared to net loss of $2.0 billion ($4.49 per diluted share) for 2015.

Adjusted net loss (a non-GAAP measure) for the year was $1.3 billion ($2.96 per diluted share), compared to an adjusted net loss of $209 million ($0.48 per diluted share) for the prior year. A complete list of the adjusted items and associated reconciliation has been provided in Table 1a. 

Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) for 2016 was $493 million, a decrease of $1.3 billion, compared to $1.8 billion in the prior year. 

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $4.2 billion for the year, an increase of $2.4 billion, compared to 2015. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) for the full year was $4.2 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in 2015. These increases are driven primarily by Halliburton’s payment of the $3.5 billion merger termination fee. 

For the year, capital expenditures were $332 million, a decrease of $633 million, or 66%, compared to 2015. This reduction is attributable to reduced activity levels and our continued focus on capital discipline. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year was $1.2 billion, down $576 million, or 33%, compared to $1.7 billion in 2015. The decline in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily driven by asset impairments and lower capital spending. 

Income tax expense was $696 million for the year, an effective tax rate of (34.1%), compared to 24.5% for 2015. The negative effective tax rate in 2016 is driven primarily by valuation allowances recorded against U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets.

During the course of 2016, we repurchased 16.2 million shares of common stock totaling $763 million.

2016 Fourth Quarter Results

Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of $57 million, or 2%, sequentially. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue was down $1.0 billion, or 29%. Sequentially, the increase in revenue was driven primarily by increased activity in North America, year-end product sales, and pockets of growth internationally. This increase was partially offset by reduced activity in the North Sea, mainly as a result of labor union strikes and weather delays in Norway and postponed projects in the U.K.

Baker Hughes Announces Fourth Quarter and Annual Results 

On a GAAP basis, net loss attributable to Baker Hughes for the fourth quarter was $417 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to $429 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter includes after-tax charges of $291 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, related to asset impairments, restructuring charges, loss on sale of a majority interest in the North America onshore pressure pumping business, inventory write-offs, and costs associated with the merger.

Adjusted net loss (a non-GAAP measure) for the quarter was $126 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Adjusted net loss excludes the above adjustments totaling $291 million after-tax, or $0.68 per diluted share. A complete list of the adjusted items and associated reconciliation has been provided in Table 1a. 

Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was $266 million for the quarter, a decrease of $3 million, or 1% sequentially, and down $110 million, or 29%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $632 million for the quarter, an increase of $513 million sequentially and $101 million year-over-year. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) for the quarter was $610 million, an increase of $501 million sequentially and $174 million year-over-year. This does not include the proceeds from the North America onshore pressure pumping transaction. The sequential increase in cash flows is driven primarily by a tax refund in the U.S. of $415 million.

Capital expenditures for the quarter were $106 million, up $36 million, sequentially, and down $108 million, or 50%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $245 million, a decline of $17 million, or 6%, sequentially, and down $171 million, or 41%, compared to the same quarter of last year. 

Corporate costs were $19 million in the quarter, compared to $78 million in the prior quarter and $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential decrease in corporate costs was primarily due to a $23-million investment gain recognized in the current quarter and $41 million of litigation settlements in the third quarter that did not repeat.

Income tax expense was $107 million for the quarter, an effective tax rate of (35%), compared to (19.4%) in the third quarter of 2016. As a result of geographic mix of earnings and losses, impairments, restructuring charges, and other discrete tax items, our tax rate has been, and will continue to be, volatile until the market stabilizes. 

In the fourth quarter of 2016 we did not repurchase any shares due to restrictions under our merger agreement.

North America

North America revenue of $775 million for the quarter increased 15% sequentially. The sequential increase was driven by improved activity in the U.S. onshore business, seasonal improvements in Canada, and completions project deliveries in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the increase in activity, the competitive landscape remained challenging across the entire segment, keeping a downward pressure on price. 

Operating loss before tax for the fourth quarter was $86 million, compared to $65 million in the prior quarter. The reduced profitability sequentially was driven primarily by a $30-million inventory write-off and a $28-million benefit from non-recurring items in the third quarter, not repeating in the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by increased profits from revenue and incremental savings from ongoing cost reduction efforts. 

Adjusted operating loss before tax (a non-GAAP measure), which excludes the inventory write-off, was $56 million for the fourth quarter, an $18-million improvement compared to $74 million in the prior quarter.

Baker Hughes Announces Fourth Quarter and Annual Results 

Latin America

Latin America revenue of $225 million in the quarter decreased 7% sequentially against the backdrop of a 2% rig count reduction. The decrease in revenue was driven mainly by reduced activity in most of the region, primarily Brazil, and a one-time product sale in the Andean area in the third quarter, not repeating in the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by increased activity in the Andean area and year-end product sales.

Operating profit before tax for the fourth quarter was $13 million, a decrease of $7 million, compared to $20 million in the prior quarter. The reduction in profitability was driven by the one-time sale and $3 million of non-recurring benefits in the prior quarter, not repeating, and activity reductions across most of the regions. This decline was partially offset by cost reductions from restructuring efforts and lower depreciation and amortization expense.

Adjusted operating profit before tax (a non-GAAP measure) was $13 million for the fourth quarter, down $3 million sequentially.

Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian

Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian revenue of $490 million for the quarter decreased 6% sequentially, primarily due to reduced activity in the North Sea, mainly as a result of labor union strikes, weather delays, and project postponements, and unfavorable exchange rates across the region, primarily in the Nigerian Naira and the British Pound. Revenue was also negatively impacted by ongoing labor union strikes in Nigeria. These revenue declines were partially offset by year-end product sales.

Operating loss before tax for the fourth quarter was $19 million, a decrease of $41 million, compared to an operating profit before tax of $22 million in the prior quarter. The reduction in profitability was mainly related to activity delays in the North Sea, $14 million of foreign exchange losses related to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, and $5 million of one-time benefits in the third quarter, not repeating. This was partially offset by savings from ongoing cost reduction efforts and reduced depreciation and amortization expense.

Adjusted operating loss before tax (a non-GAAP measure) was $19 million for the fourth quarter, a $32-million decrease compared to the $13-million adjusted operating profit before tax in the prior quarter. 

Middle East/Asia Pacific

Middle East/Asia Pacific revenue of $687 million for the quarter was up by 6% sequentially. The growth in revenue was driven primarily by year-end product sales in Qatar, China, and Saudi Arabia, and pockets of activity growth in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Operating profit before tax for the fourth quarter was $91 million, an increase of $20 million, compared to $71 million in the prior quarter. The increase in profitability was driven mostly by higher revenue, including year-end product sales, $14 million of bad debt reversals, savings from ongoing cost reductions, and lower depreciation and amortization expense. This was partially offset by the $6 million benefit from non-recurring items in the third quarter, not repeating this quarter.

Adjusted operating profit before tax (a non-GAAP measure) was $91 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $28 million, compared to $63 million in the prior quarter.

Baker Hughes Announces Fourth Quarter and Annual Results 

Industrial Services

Industrial Services revenue of $233 million for the quarter decreased 13% sequentially. The decrease in revenue was mainly related to project delays and seasonal activity declines in the process and pipeline business. 

Operating profit before tax for the fourth quarter was $11 million, a decrease of $19 million, compared to $30 million in the prior quarter. The sequential decrease in profitability was primarily driven by the activity reductions and exacerbated by the $3-million benefit from non-recurring items in the third quarter, not repeating this quarter.

Adjusted operating profit before tax (a non-GAAP measure) was $11 million for the fourth quarter, $15 million less than the $26-million in the prior quarter.

Innovations to Earnings

The following section provides operational and technical highlights outlining the successes aligned to our strategy.

Efficient Well Construction

Baker Hughes sets drilling record for integrated project in the North Sea. Baker Hughes was recognized by an operator for drilling a 17½-in. hole section in record time. The 3,188-ft section was drilled in 4.8 hours with an average rate of penetration of 656 ft/hr - about 50% faster than the operator’s previous record for a 17½ in. hole section. Baker Hughes provided directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling, mud logging, drilling fluids, liner hangers, wireline, and cementing services to the operator. 

Baker Hughes wins multi-year contract to provide integrated drilling and well services for Statoil in the North Sea. Baker Hughes will provide cementing and pumping services, completions, drilling and completions fluids, and integrated drilling services on the Cat J rig, Askepott. The award is for four years with the option for two two-year extensions.

Baker Hughes wins multi-million dollar drilling and wireline services contract for major operator in the Gulf of Mexico. Baker Hughes displaced a competitor in providing directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, and openhole and casedhole wireline services on multiple wells. Operations are expected to commence in early 2017 on a multi-year contract.

Baker Hughes wins multi-year, ultradeepwater contract in Brazil. Baker Hughes stands to increase its market presence in Brazil by providing drilling services, logging-while-drilling, wireline services, pressure pumping, drill bits, and concentric expandable hole-opening services for four wells offshore Brazil. Baker Hughes was selected for its experience and track record in the region.

Baker Hughes sets drilling records across the globe with new Kymera™ Xtreme (XT) hybrid drill bits. The company has set performance records in Norway, The Netherlands, the Gulf of Mexico, the Permian Basin, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Australia. In one case, an operator used a Kymera XT bit to drill a challenging intermediate section offshore. The bit drilled from a depth of 1165 ft to 7487 ft in just under 28 hours, saving a day of rig time and almost doubling the rate of penetration when compared to a competitor’s offset polycrystalline diamond bit run. 

StayTrue™ shaped diamond element technology sets new performance standards. StayTrue technology improves drilling efficiency and durability by enhancing bit stability. This technology has achieved step-change improvements in drilling performance in shale plays across the U.S. In the Permian Basin, an operator used a bit with StayTrue technology to drill an intermediate section. Compared to the offset well, the footage drilled improved by 66% while drilling at a 40% higher rate of penetration. Additionally, according to the Baker Hughes MultiSense™ in-bit vibration monitoring device, the bit drilled smoothly for 95% of the run time—a vast improvement over the initial well that achieved only 45% smooth drilling time.

Baker Hughes deploys drilling system composed of AutoTrak™ eXact rotary steerable system (RSS), AziTrak™ tool, and Talon™ Force drill bit in the Rockies. Baker Hughes was called in mid-well to assist an operator experiencing sliding issues, high vibration, and short run times. The Baker Hughes drilling system displaced the competitor's system at a depth of 19,000 ft, with planned total depth of 23,500 ft. The AutoTrak eXact RSS drilled 900 ft to its initial target and then was redirected to hit a new target zone, requiring Baker Hughes to pull the well back and sidetrack in open hole. The sidetrack was successful on the first attempt, earning accolades from the operator for the drilling system’s ability to steer precisely and accomplish a flawless openhole sidetrack at over 19,000 ft.

Baker Hughes sets record for number of plugs milled in a single trip. Baker Hughes deployed thru-tubing fishing technology to mill 72 composite plugs with a single motor and mill, saving the operator 30 hours of rig time and achieving a company record for milling the largest number of plugs in a single trip. This drillout performance was enabled by long motor life and the Glyphaloy™ carbide advanced milling technology. The successful mill run led the operator to choose Baker Hughes as its preferred drillout provider moving forward.

DeepShield™ safety valve achieves success in the Gulf of Mexico. A major operator deployed Baker Hughes’ DeepShield deepwater subsurface safety valve, a 2016 World Oil Award winner, in a deepwater well. As a result of delivering flawless execution in two critical wells, the company’s DeepShield valve has been selected as the operator’s safety valve of choice for upcoming deepwater completions in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition to its unprecedented design and quality, the DeepShield valve is the industry’s first ISO V1-validated safety valve, delivering the highest level of product reliability in its class.

Baker Hughes wins World Oil Best Deepwater Technology award. The BASTILLE™ removable production packer is the first in the industry that can be reliably removed from a well after years of exposure to harsh, ultra HP/HT conditions of up to 450°F and 20,000 psi (highest ratings in the industry to date). Unlike conventional removable packers that can fuse to the casing after exposure to high temperatures and pressures—and require a day or more of intervention—the BASTILLE packer’s design enables simple and reliable removal, allowing operators working in high-cost deepwater wells to realize the efficiency they need from a removable packer.

Baker Hughes deploys XtremeBond™ cement spacer system for operator in Canada. The XtremeBond spacer has been successfully deployed in high-temperature well applications for a major oil company in Canada. As a result, several more jobs were awarded to Baker Hughes for a critical well campaign, displacing the incumbent cement provider. 

Optimizing Well Production and Increasing Ultimate Recovery

Baker Hughes optimizes frac design, improves operating efficiencies, and significantly reduces costly screenouts for an integrated hydraulic fracturing operation in tight gas field. The company’s geoscience and petroleum engineering (GPE) experts supported the Pressure Pumping, Completions, and Wireline Services businesses to execute an integrated completions and stimulation contract for an operator in Latin America. GPE subsurface analysis results were used to fine-tune the frac stage and treatment planning, as well as to optimize plug-and-perf operations— improving operational efficiencies and reducing costs by virtually eliminating screenouts. The company completed more than 27 wells with 246+ fracture stages with a 97% success rate and incurred only six screenouts – a reduction of 80% compared to similar operations carried out without the use of expert subsurface analysis and modeling. 

Baker Hughes executes first offshore unconventional fracturing project in the United Arab Emirates. Baker Hughes’ Pressure Pumping team deployed its StimFORCE™ modular stimulation system—a safe and affordable solution for the operator—for an exploration well in a high-pressure environment offshore Abu Dhabi. This marks Baker Hughes’ first integrated offshore hydraulic fracturing project in the region. 

Baker Hughes wins three-year production chemicals contract in the Permian Basin. Under terms of this contract, Baker Hughes will provide a full suite of production chemicals and services including PETROSWEET™ H2S scavengers, paraffin and scale inhibitors, CRONOX™ corrosion inhibitors, and truck-treating services. Baker Hughes was ranked first in the tender process for its technical acumen. Local support and infrastructure capabilities were other factors that contributed to the company’s position as the #1 chemical supplier in the Permian Basin. 

Baker Hughes increases production efficiency and economics for an operator in the Caspian Sea. Baker Hughes deployed its SureVIEW™ optical wireline logging tool to overcome challenges related to significant sand production. The technology enables operators to precisely identify and classify sand entry and leaks using a combination of novel 

Baker Hughes Incorporated News ReleasePage 22

Baker Hughes Announces Fourth Quarter and Annual Results 

fiber-optic sensing methods, traditional wireline logging tools, and advanced data analysis techniques. Upon deploying the tool and applying remediation, the operator immediately reduced sand production by 75%. The tool is now being deployed throughout the operator’s assets. 

Baker Hughes wins chemical management services contract in India. By demonstrating its ability to manage difficult polymer floods, Baker Hughes was awarded a contract to supply a portfolio of chemicals, including TRETOLITE™ demulsifiers and water clarifiers, scale inhibitors, CRONOX™ corrosion inhibitors, X-CIDE™ biocides, schmoo removers, defoamers, filter aids, and oxygen scavengers. 

Baker Hughes wins production chemicals and services contract for North America enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project. Baker Hughes was awarded a two-year contract to supply production chemicals and related services to a field undergoing EOR in North America. The in-depth chemical and service offering will include CRONOX™ corrosion inhibitors, scale inhibitors, biocides, asphaltene inhibitors and dispersants, and TRETOLITE™ fluids separation technologies.

Baker Hughes expands its presence in Africa with major deepwater contract. The company will provide umbilical, leak testing, and dewatering services during the next 18+ months to the Offshore Cape Three Point Integrated Oil and Gas Project. 

Baker Hughes launches leading high-definition corrosion solution. Baker Hughes now offers the VECTRA™ HD enhanced in-line inspection service in four common pipeline sizes, advancing magnetic flux leakage (MFL) technology to a new level. With a greater density of triaxial sensors, the VECTRA HD service gives pipeline operators a more accurate view of complex anomalies and the best chance to identify and size challenging features such as pinholes in the pipe body or complex clusters.

Baker Hughes awarded three chemical contract extensions in North America. Baker Hughes has signed multi-year contract extensions with three refiners in North America without the need for a competitive bid. The contracts cover process chemicals, water treatment, and finished fuel additives. The team’s ability to provide value at every opportunity is credited for the win, along with aligning with the strategic needs of the refinery. Implementing new technologies such as the XERIC™ heavy oil pretreatment, JETTISON™ solids release agent, and SMARTGUARD™ 2800 high-temperature corrosion inhibitor, has enabled the refiners to safely expand their operating envelope, and increase their crude diet flexibility, improving the reliability and profitability of the refinery.
