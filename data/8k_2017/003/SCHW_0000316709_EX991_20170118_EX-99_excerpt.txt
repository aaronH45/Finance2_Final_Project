 CEO Walt Bettinger said, “Schwab achieved truly noteworthy results in 2016 by sustaining our ‘Through Clients’ Eyes’ strategy and working to earn our clients’ trust every day. During the year, from disappointing economic news early on, to the disruption of the Brexit vote, and then through the tumult of the presidential election, clients could trust that Schwab stood ready to help them navigate market volatility, and they made active use of our full-service capabilities. Our financial consultants held planning conversations with approximately 132,000 clients last year, up 18% from 2015. Client assets enrolled in one of our retail advisory solutions and those guided by independent advisors totaled $1.40 trillion at the end of 2016, up 12%. New and existing clients brought $125.5 billion in core net new assets to Schwab during 2016, marking a 5% annual organic growth rate and the 5th consecutive year over $100 billion. Net new assets in our Retail and Advisor Services businesses rose by 10% and 21%, respectively, over the prior year, while Mutual Fund Clearing and Retirement Plan flows slowed due to client turnover. Total client assets at year-end were a record $2.78 trillion, up 11%.   

 1  

We closed out 2016 serving more clients than ever, including 10.2 million active brokerage accounts, 1.1 million banking accounts and 1.5 million retirement plan participants, increases of 4%, 7% and 2%, respectively.”   

 ﻿  

 Mr. Bettinger continued, “As Schwab continues to offer more value and a better investing experience, new and existing clients choose to entrust us with more of their assets, fueling our financial performance. Our revenues rose 17% to a record $7.5 billion in 2016. On the expense front, we entered the year with goals that allowed for needed growth in our infrastructure and increased reinvestment to better serve clients while still delivering improved profitability. We kept to those goals through the ups and downs of 2016, which helped us increase net income by nearly a third over our 2015 performance, to a record $1.9 billion.”  

 ﻿  

 Mr. Bettinger added, “Our work to challenge the status quo on behalf of our clients continued across multiple fronts in 2016. We expanded and enhanced our Schwab OpenView Gateway® and Schwab Advisor Center® platforms to help the independent advisors who custody with us operate more efficiently and stay focused on serving their clients. We introduced Schwab Intelligent Advisory® as an extension of our contemporary, full-service approach to helping all individual clients build and manage their wealth. Schwab Intelligent Advisory is designed to be broadly accessible with a low balance minimum and fee, combining personalized financial and investment planning through CFP® professionals with automated and diversified portfolio management through Schwab Intelligent Portfolios®. As part of our commitment to offering more value to investors, we launched the Schwab Target Index Funds, a new series of target-date mutual funds constructed with Schwab ETFs that are designed to be the lowest cost of their kind available to employer-sponsored retirement plans and retail investors.* We also expanded Schwab ETF OneSource™ by 16 net new funds in 2016, enabling Schwab clients to choose from a total of 228 ETFs covering 69 Morningstar categories, all for $0 online trade commissions. In addition, we introduced the Schwab Live hub to provide traders with centralized access to the interactive and live content we offer to help them succeed. We also continued our work to make it easier to establish a relationship with a locally-based investment professional by extending our footprint across the country – we added 3 new company branches and 5 new independent branches during the year.”  

 ﻿  

 CFO Joe Martinetto commented, “Schwab’s 2016 performance is a clear example of the company’s financial formula again working as designed: solid business growth driving solid revenue growth through diversified sources, leading to improved profitability through continued expense discipline. We expanded client assets by 11% during an environment that had some rough patches but ultimately included improving economic conditions, positive equity market returns and, at long last, the second small step by the Federal Reserve away from its zero interest rate policy of recent years. We achieved 17% revenue growth by generating record levels of net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, which more than offset lower revenue from trading and the conclusion of certain litigation. Net interest revenue rose 32% to $3.3 billion due to a strong increase in client cash sweep deposits and higher short-term interest rates. Asset management and administration fees rose by 15% to $3.1 billion largely due to higher money market fund management fees relating to the rate environment and continued lift in client assets enrolled in one of our retail advisory solutions. Higher rates provided breathing room for our increased investment in people and technology, resulting in 9% expense growth for 2016. This increase more than doubled our constrained 2015 increase but still allowed for a 780 basis point gap between revenue and expense growth and a record 40% pre-tax profit margin, beating the prior high-water mark set in 2008.”  

 ﻿  

 Mr. Martinetto concluded, “We remain focused on managing the company’s balance sheet to support growth initiatives and further our strategy of optimizing the spread earned on client cash sweep balances. We completed approximately $8 billion in bulk transfers to Schwab Bank during 2016, including approximately $4 billion in the fourth quarter. These transfers, along with growth in bank deposits from our ongoing asset gathering, helped increase interest-earning assets on our balance sheet by 22% during 2016 to $216 billion at year-end. We supported this growth with capital generated through earnings and the issuance of approximately $1.4 billion in additional preferred stock. As part of managing Schwab’s capital levels, we maintain a target range for common stock dividends equal to 20-30% of earnings; consistent with our improving earnings picture, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 17% during the year, to $0.07. We ended 2016 with a preliminary Tier-1 Leverage ratio of 7.2% and a full-year return on equity of 14%, the highest in seven years. Our solid capital position and healthy returns position Schwab to continue investing for profitable growth and sharing the benefits of our scale with clients while building long-term stockholder value.”
