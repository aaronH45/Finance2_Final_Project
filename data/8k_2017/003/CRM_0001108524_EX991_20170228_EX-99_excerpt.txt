SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. - Feb. 28, 2017 - Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the world’s #1 CRM company and the Intelligent Customer Success Platform, today announced results for its fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended January 31, 2017.

“We drove tremendous execution during the quarter, delivering nearly $2.3 billion in revenue,” said Keith Block, vice chairman, president and COO, Salesforce. “And for fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver more than $10 billion in revenue--reaching that milestone faster than any enterprise software company in history. No other software company of our size and scale is growing at this rate.”

“In addition to our outstanding top-line results, we also delivered our first ever $2 billion year of operating cash flow,” said Mark Hawkins, CFO, Salesforce. “To put these results in perspective, over the last three years, we have doubled our revenue, nearly tripled our free cash flow and improved non-GAAP operating margin by more than 400 basis points.”

Computation of Basic and Diluted GAAP and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share

(in thousands, except per share data)

(Unaudited)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This press release includes information about non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP tax rates, non-GAAP free cash flow, and constant currency revenue and constant currency deferred revenue growth rates (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating the company’s performance.

The primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors who wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items on the company’s operating performance and to enable investors to evaluate the company’s results in the same way management does. These non-cash or non-recurring items generally consist of one-time items resulting from strategic decisions that affect multiple periods or periods unrelated to when the actual items were incurred. Management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure that excludes items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period provides investors with a more complete view of the company’s operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the company’s business. Further, to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the company’s relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, amortization of acquired leases, the net amortization of debt discount on the company’s convertible senior notes, gains/losses on sales of land and building improvements, gains/losses on company-initiated acquisitions of entities in which the company held an equity investment, and termination of office leases, as well as income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these items were not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but were made for the company’s long-term benefit over multiple periods. 

Specifically, management is excluding the following items from its non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 and its non-GAAP estimates for Q1 and FY18:

•Stock-Based Expenses: The company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. 

•Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Acquired Leases: The company views amortization of acquisition- and building-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. 

•Amortization of Debt Discount: Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the company’s $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes due 2018 that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rate was approximately 2.5% for the convertible notes due 2018, while the actual coupon interest rate of the notes is 0.25%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. 

•Gains on Acquisitions of Strategic Investments: The company views gains on sales of its strategic investments resulting from acquisitions initiated by the company in which an equity interest was previously held as discrete events and not indicative of operational performance during any particular period. 

•Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The Company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisitions-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, amortization of acquired leases, amortization of debt discount, gains/losses on the sales of land and building improvements, gains on sales of strategic investments, and termination of office leases. The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three-year period, and considers other factors including the Company’s tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates. This long-term rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings mix including acquisition activity, or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the company operates. The Company re-evaluates this long-term rate on an annual basis or if any significant events that may materially affect this long-term rate occur. The non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 35.0 percent. The non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2018 is 34.5 percent.

The company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. For this purpose, capital expenditures does not include our strategic investments, nor does it include any costs or activities related to our purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, and building - leased facilities.
