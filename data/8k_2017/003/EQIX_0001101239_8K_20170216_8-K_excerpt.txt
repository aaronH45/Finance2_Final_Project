 Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

Effective February 16, 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Equinix, Inc. (“Equinix”) approved the Equinix Annual Incentive Plan and related award agreement for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 (collectively, the “2017 Plan”) for eligible employees of Equinix, including executive officers.  

Under the 2017 Plan, an annual target bonus amount will be assigned to each executive officer. The annual target bonus amounts under the 2017 Plan will be a percentage of each executive’s base salary, ranging from 85% to 130% depending on the executive’s position, and will be payable in cash. For executives, the awards are capped at the target payout, with no greater payout for over-performance. The actual annual bonus is determined on the basis of Equinix’s performance against revenue (weighted at 50%) and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) (weighted at 50%) goals, based on the Board-approved operating plan, adjusted from time to time throughout the plan year (the “Goals”). The Goals will exclude the impact of one-time events affecting the operating plan, such as expansion projects or acquisitions not contemplated in the approved operating plan, and will exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies against the foreign currency rates applied in the operating plan. 100% of the 2017 Plan will be funded if the Goals are met. For every 1% below the Goals for revenue, the revenue portion of the bonus pool shall be reduced by 20%, and for every 1% below the Goals for AFFO, the AFFO portion of the bonus pool shall be reduced by 20%. No bonuses will be paid if revenue and AFFO are 95% or less of the Goals. In addition, at its discretion the Compensation Committee may reduce or eliminate the actual award that otherwise would be payable.
