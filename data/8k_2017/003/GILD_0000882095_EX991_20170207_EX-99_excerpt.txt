February 7, 2017 3

During the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015:

•R&D expenses and non-GAAP R&D expenses* increased primarily due to the overall progression of Gilead’s clinical studies, including ongoing milestone payments. 

•R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 also include an impairment charge related to in-process R&D (IPR&D).

For 2016 compared to 2015:

•R&D expenses and non-GAAP R&D expenses* increased primarily due to the overall progression of Gilead’s clinical studies, including ongoing milestone payments, and Gilead’s purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority review voucher. 

•R&D expenses for 2016 also include up-front collaboration expenses related to Gilead’s license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos NV, purchase of Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and impairment charges related to IPR&D.

•SG&A expenses and non-GAAP SG&A expenses* decreased primarily due to lower branded prescription drug fee expense, partially offset by higher costs to support Gilead’s product launches and the geographic expansion of its business.

As of December 31, 2016, Gilead had $32.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared to $26.2 billion as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to the issuance of $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in September 2016.

committee of the European Medicines Agency, adopted a positive opinion on Gilead’s Marketing Authorization Application for Vemlidy. 

•Announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to FDA for an investigational, once-daily single-tablet regimen containing sofosbuvir 400 mg, velpatasvir 100 mg, and voxilaprevir 100 mg for the treatment of direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-experienced HCV-infected patients. The data submitted in the NDA support the use of the regimen for 12 weeks in DAA-experienced patients with genotype 1 to 6 HCV infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.

•Announced positive results from an open-label Phase 2 trial evaluating the investigational apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 inhibitor selonsertib (formerly GS-4997) alone or in combination with the monoclonal antibody simtuzumab in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and moderate to severe liver fibrosis (fibrosis stages F2 or F3). The data demonstrate regression in fibrosis that was, in parallel, associated with reductions in other measures of liver injury in patients treated with selonsertib for 24 weeks. These data were presented in a late-breaking abstract session at the Liver Meeting® 2016.

•Announced positive two-year (96-week) data from a Phase 3 study and 48-week data from two Phase 3b studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of switching virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected patients from regimens containing Truvada® (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) to regimens containing Descovy®. Results demonstrated regimens containing Descovy to be statistically non-inferior to regimens containing Truvada, with improvements in certain renal and bone laboratory parameters among patients receiving Descovy-based regimens.

Non-GAAP Financial Information 

The information presented in this document has been prepared by Gilead in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), unless otherwise noted as non-GAAP.

revenues for its antiviral and other programs; the risk that estimates of patients with HCV or anticipated patient demand may not be accurate; the risk that private and public payers may be reluctant to provide, or continue to provide, coverage or reimbursement for new products, including Epclusa, Harvoni, Genvoya, Odefsey, Descovy and Vemlidy; the potential for increased pricing pressure and contracting pressure as well as decreased volume and market share from additional competitive HCV launches; austerity measures in European countries and Japan that may increase the amount of discount required on Gilead’s products; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments and geographic regions and decreases in treatment duration; availability of funding for state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) and Veterans Administration (VA); continued fluctuations in ADAP and VA purchases driven by federal and state grant cycles which may not mirror patient demand and may cause fluctuations in Gilead’s earnings; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of Viread and Truvada outside the United States, an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; and potential amendments to the Affordable Care Act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices or reducing the number of insured patients; the possibility of unfavorable results from clinical trials involving investigational compounds; Gilead’s ability to initiate clinical trials in its currently anticipated timeframes; the levels of inventory held by wholesalers and retailers which may cause fluctuations in Gilead’s earnings; Gilead’s ability to submit new drug applications for new product candidates in the timelines currently anticipated; Gilead’s ability to receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all, for new and current products, including its single-tablet regimen containing sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir; Gilead’s ability to successfully commercialize its products, including Epclusa, Harvoni, Genvoya, Odefsey, Descovy and Vemlidy; the risk that physicians and patients may not see advantages of these products over other therapies and may therefore be reluctant to prescribe the products; Gilead’s ability to successfully develop its oncology, inflammation, cardiovascular and respiratory programs; safety and efficacy data from clinical studies may not warrant further development of Gilead’s product candidates, including selonsertib; Gilead’s ability to pay dividends or complete its share repurchase program due to changes in its stock price, corporate or other market conditions; fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the U.S. dollar that may cause an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact on Gilead’s future revenues and pre-tax earnings; and other risks identified from time to time in Gilead’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, Gilead makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Gilead bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. You are urged to consider statements that include the words may, will, would, could, should, might, believes, estimates, projects, potential, expects, plans, anticipates, intends, continues, forecast, designed, goal, or the negative of those words or other comparable words to be uncertain and forward-looking. Gilead directs readers to its press releases, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and other subsequent disclosure documents filed with the SEC. Gilead claims the protection of the Safe Harbor contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements.
