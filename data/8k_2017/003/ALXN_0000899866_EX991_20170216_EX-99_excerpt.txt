"In 2016 the global Alexion team delivered on our patient-centered objectives as we grew our leadership in complement by serving more patients with PNH and aHUS, and continued to build our metabolic franchise with the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma. We also achieved important regulatory milestones towards new indications for Soliris and initiated two registration studies for ALXN1210 to drive our future growth," said David Brennan, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Alexion. "Our 2017 guidance reflects double-digit revenue and EPS growth as we continue to grow our complement and metabolic franchises, prepare for the potential launches of Soliris in refractory gMG, and focus on our highest priority R&D programs."

•During the fourth quarter, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $85 million related to SBC-103, an early stage, clinical indefinite-lived intangible asset from the Synageva acquisition. This charge was taken as a result of a strategic evaluation of the asset, increases in the development and commercial timelines, and updated cash flows. In February 2017, Alexion decided to reduce its investment in SBC-103. Patients currently enrolled in the Phase 1/2 trial will continue to receive SBC-103, and no additional Alexion studies are planned. Alexion will reassess the value of this asset on a go forward basis.

Share Repurchase Authorization 

The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has increased the size of the Company's share repurchase authorization to a total of $1 billion. The Board’s authorization is open-ended.

(1) In March 2016, the FASB issued a new standard intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payments. We elected to early adopt this standard during the third quarter of 2016. The adoption of the new standard requires recognition of excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. As a result, $238 million associated with previously unrecognized excess tax benefits was recorded as a deferred tax asset and an increase in retained earnings as of the beginning of 2016.
