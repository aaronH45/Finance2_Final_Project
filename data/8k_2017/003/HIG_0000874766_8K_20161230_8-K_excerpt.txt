Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

On December 30, 2016, Hartford Fire Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the “Hartford Insurers”), which are wholly owned insurance company subsidiaries of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the “Company”), entered into an Aggregate Excess of Loss Reinsurance Agreement (the “Reinsurance Agreement”) with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”). The Company and the Hartford Insurers concurrently entered into certain other related agreements with NICO and certain of its affiliates (collectively with the Reinsurance Agreement, the “Agreements”) to effectuate the terms of the transaction.

The Agreements, which are effective as of December 31, 2016, provide as follows: (i) the Hartford Insurers will pay NICO a reinsurance premium of $650 million in exchange for $1.5 billion of reinsurance for adverse net loss reserve development above the Company’s existing net asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) reserves as of December 31, 2016; (ii) the Company will retain the risk of collection on the Hartford Insurers’ third-party reinsurance; (iii) the Company will retain responsibility for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions; (iv) the $650 million reinsurance premium paid to NICO will be placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Hartford Insurers, and (v) Berkshire will provide a parental guarantee to secure the obligations of NICO under the Agreements. The reinsurance will cover adverse development on substantially all the Company’s A&E reserves, excluding those held by the Company’s U.K. Property and Casualty run-off subsidiaries (under contract to be sold with a closing projected for the first quarter 2017), as well as other non-U.S. operations with less than $3 million in A&E reserves. 

The transaction will be accounted for as retroactive reinsurance in the Company’s GAAP financial statements and is expected to result in a net loss of approximately $423 million, after-tax, in the fourth quarter of 2016.
