“As Adjusted” Financial Results and non-GAAP Measures  

During the second quarter of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, GAAP revenue, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share include the net impact from Windows 10 revenue deferrals. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, GAAP revenue, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share include the results of LinkedIn. These items are defined below. In addition to these financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, Microsoft has provided certain non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the company’s performance. Presenting these non-GAAP measures gives additional insight into operational performance and helps clarify trends affecting the company’s business. For comparability of reporting, management considers this information in conjunction with GAAP amounts in evaluating business performance.  

Net Impact from Windows 10 Revenue Deferrals. With respect to our non-GAAP measures related to Windows 10 revenue, we believe these measures bridge investor information and minimize potential confusion during the brief period between the time Windows 10 revenue recognition moved from upfront to ratable, and the adoption of the new revenue standard, when Windows 10 will again be recognized predominantly upfront. The net change in Windows 10 revenue from period to period is indicative of the net change in revenue we expect from adoption of the new revenue standard.  

LinkedIn Results. With respect to our non-GAAP measure related to LinkedIn results, we believe this measure will help investors compare actual results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 to the guidance previously provided for the quarter, which excluded LinkedIn. We do not anticipate providing this non-GAAP measure in the future as our guidance will incorporate expected results for LinkedIn.  

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

Non-GAAP Definitions  

Net Impact from Windows 10 Revenue Deferrals. Microsoft recorded net revenue deferrals of $2.0 billion during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and net revenue deferrals of $1.7 billion during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, related to Windows 10.  

With the launch of Windows 10 in July 2015, Windows 10 customers receive future versions and updates at no additional charge. Under current revenue recognition accounting guidance, when standalone software is sold with future upgrade rights, revenue must be deferred over the life of the computing device on which it is installed. This is different from prior versions of Windows, which were sold without upgrade rights, where all revenue from original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers was recognized at the time of billing, i.e., upfront.  

When Microsoft adopts the new revenue standard, predominantly all Windows OEM revenue will be recognized at the time of billing, which is similar to the revenue recognition for prior versions of Windows. Additional information regarding the new revenue standard is provided in the “Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted” section of Microsoft’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 (Notes to Financial Statements). Microsoft reflects the recognition of Windows 10 revenue at the time of billing in “As Adjusted for Windows 10 Revenue Deferrals (non-GAAP)” revenue to provide comparability during the short period where Windows 10 will be recognized over the estimated life of a device, i.e., ratable, rather than at the time of billing.  

LinkedIn Results. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, LinkedIn contributed revenue, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share of $228 million, $(201) million, $(100) million, and $(0.01), respectively. Microsoft excludes the results of LinkedIn and reflects the recognition of Windows 10 revenue at the time of billing in “As Further Adjusted for Windows 10 Revenue Deferrals, Excluding LinkedIn Results (non-GAAP)” to help investors compare results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 to the guidance previously provided for the quarter, which excluded LinkedIn.  

Constant Currency  

Microsoft presents constant currency information to provide a non-GAAP framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period non-GAAP results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. The non-GAAP financial measures presented below should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year.
