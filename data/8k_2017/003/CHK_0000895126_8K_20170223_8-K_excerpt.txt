Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On February 23, 2017, Chesapeake Energy Corporation issued a press release reporting fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial and operational results and its 2017 outlook and capital expenditure program. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

During the preparation of its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, the company identified pricing-related revisions to its estimates of proved reserves and the related present value of its future net revenues therefrom. These revisions impacted our previously reported impairment of oil and natural gas properties and related depreciation, depletion and amortization for each of the quarterly periods ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2016. Management evaluated the materiality of these revisions on a qualitative and quantitative basis and concluded that they were not material to the company’s previously issued interim financial statements. The impact to our impairment of oil and natural gas properties and depreciation, depletion and amortization from the revised estimates of proved reserves and the related present value of its future net revenues are set forth below:

The company will revise its quarterly financial data in its annual report on Form 10-K to reflect these revised amounts.

Chesapeake is completing its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 and, as a result of the revisions discussed above, expects to report a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in its annual report on Form 10-K. Further discussion of the material weakness and the related revisions to the company’s previously issued interim financial statements will be included in Chesapeake’s Form 10-K, which is expected to be filed on or before March 1, 2017 with the SEC.
