Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure

On February 1, 2017, DTE Energy Company (DTE Energy) will post a summary and discussion of the Michigan Public Service Commission's (MPSC) order in DTE Electric Company's (DTE Electric) rate case to the DTE Energy website at www.dteenergy.com. In the paragraph of the summary under the heading "Future Outlook for DTE Energy", which paragraph is furnished as part of Exhibit 99.1 hereto, DTE Energy reaffirms its 2017 operating earnings guidance of $5.15-$5.46 per share. DTE Electric is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DTE Energy.

In the summary and this filing, DTE Energy discusses 2017 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2017 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2017 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items. These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.
