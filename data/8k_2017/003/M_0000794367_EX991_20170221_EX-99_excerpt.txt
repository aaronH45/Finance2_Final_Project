Macy’s, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and FY2016 Results

Diluted 2016 EPS is $1.99, or $3.11 as adjusted; Company provides 2017 sales and earnings guidance

CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) today reported fiscal 2016 earnings per diluted share of $1.99, or $3.11 per diluted share excluding certain items discussed below.

“While 2016 was not the year we expected, we made significant progress on key initiatives that are starting to bear fruit. These include continued improvement in our digital platforms, the rollout of our new approach to fine jewelry and women’s shoes, an increase in exclusive merchandise and the refinement of our clearance and off-price strategy. We also took a big step forward in rightsizing our physical footprint and restructuring our entire organization. The combination of these initiatives will help us gain market share, return to growth and drive enhanced value for our shareholders over time,” said Terry J. Lundgren, Macy’s chairman and chief executive officer.

“We will be investing for the future in 2017. Looking at the continued challenges in the retail environment and changing consumer shopping behaviors, we know we must evolve our strategy and execute faster,” Lundgren said. “Key to this is enhancing the customer experience in our stores where we are developing and testing concepts that feature new merchandise and entertainment options alongside enhanced technology to make shopping simpler. Additional initiatives that we believe will improve sales trends in 2017 include continued omnichannel improvements, an updated marketing strategy and a simplified pricing structure.”

“We continued to make progress on the execution of our real estate strategy in the fourth quarter of 2016 and will carry that momentum into 2017. Overall, real estate transactions in fiscal 2016 generated cash proceeds of approximately $675 million, which is helping to fund continued reinvestment in the business. We also began work on deriving value from our partnership with Brookfield Asset Management. We are excited by the potential of our real estate strategy, and in 2017, we will focus on advancing the Brookfield partnership and continuing to monetize the locations that we have closed or plan to close. We are also developing strategies that will help create value for Herald Square while making the store an even more vibrant retail experience,” Lundgren added.

For the full year 2016, adjusted earnings (excluding items described below) were $3.11 per diluted share.

Real Estate Update

In fiscal 2016, the company's asset sales totaled $673 million in cash proceeds ($209 million in book gains).

Macy’s, Inc. continues to harvest real estate value opportunistically where the value of the real estate as a redevelopment exceeds that of non-strategic operating locations. In addition, the company is closing less productive stores and selling the associated real estate.

As an example of these actions, Macy’s, Inc. completed the previously announced sale of its Union Square Men’s building in San Francisco for $250 million in gross proceeds. The Men’s Store will be incorporated into the Union Square Main building. The company also anticipates additional enhancements to its Union Square Main building through the conversion of street-level selling space into high-end luxury retail shops that will be leased to third parties. Likewise, Macy’s, Inc. is exploring strategies that will help create value and further improve the customer experience at its Herald Square store in New York City. The company also expects to close shortly on the previously announced sale of its downtown Minneapolis store.

To further create value from its real estate portfolio, the company continues to work with its strategic partner, Brookfield Asset Management, on approximately 50 identified assets. Brookfield’s expertise will be invaluable in accelerating redevelopment and maximizing the value of these properties. Contemplated developments include retail, as well as alternative uses, such as multifamily housing, hotels and offices. The projects range from the complete ground-up redevelopment of a building to the development of parcels in a parking area, while maintaining a store presence.

CEO Transition

Macy’s, Inc. also announced today that its previously announced CEO transition will occur on March 23, 2017. As noted in the company’s June 23, 2016, announcement, Jeff Gennette, president of Macy’s, Inc., will assume the CEO role and Terry Lundgren will continue as executive chairman of the company.

Looking Ahead

In fiscal 2017, the company expects comparable sales on an owned basis to decline between 2.2 percent and 3.3 percent, with comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to decline between 2.0 percent and 3.0 percent. Total sales are expected to be down between 3.2 percent and 4.3 percent in fiscal 2017, reflecting the 66 stores closed in 2016. Total sales for fiscal 2017 reflect a 53rd week of sales, whereas comparable sales are on a 52-week basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $3.37 and $3.62 are expected in 2017, excluding the impact of the anticipated settlement charges related to the company’s defined benefit plans. Excluding the impact of the anticipated fourth quarter gain on the sale of the Union Square Men’s building in San Francisco and the anticipated settlement charges related to the company’s defined benefit plans, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.90 to $3.15 are expected in 2017.

Capital expenditures for 2017 are expected to be approximately $900 million.

In fiscal 2017, the company expects to open Macy’s stores in Westfield Century City, Los Angeles, CA, and Fashion Place, Murray, UT, as well as approximately 30 additional Bluemercury locations and approximately 30 Macy’s Backstage locations inside Macy’s stores. Announced new stores in future years include Bloomingdale’s in San Jose, CA (2019), and Norwalk, CT (2019). In addition, under license agreements with Al Tayer Group, a new Bloomingdale’s store is planned to open in 360 Mall in Al Zahra, Kuwait in spring 2017 and new Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores are planned to open in Al Maryah Central in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in 2018.

Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the Company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, which includes the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties, assists in evaluating the Company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items from operating income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude period-to-period provides useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the Company's ability to generate earnings and leverage sales and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods. Further, providing cash flow from operating activities net of cash used in investing activities is a useful measure in evaluating Macy's ability to generate cash from operations after giving effect to cash used by investing activities. Management believes that excluding cash flows from financing activities from the calculation of this measure is particularly useful where the amounts of such items are not consistent in the periods presented.

The reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis) is in the same manner as illustrated below, where the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties is the only reconciling item. In addition, the Company does not provide the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure of diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders because the timing and amount of excluded items (e.g., asset impairment charges, retirement settlement charges and other store closing related costs) are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate.

Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the Company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
