Forward looking statements and related matters This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words “may,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “goal,” “plan,” “should,” “will,” “predict,” “guidance,” “potential” or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Other than historical facts included in this presentation, all information and statements, including but not limited to information regarding planned capital expenditures, estimated reserves, estimated production targets, drilling and development plans, the timing of production, planned capital expenditures, and other plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Although, as of the date of this presentation, Newfield believes that these expectations are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including but not limited to commodity prices, drilling results, our liquidity and the availability of capital resources, operating risks, industry conditions, China and U.S. governmental regulations, financial counterparty risks, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, our ability to monetize assets and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, labor conditions, severe weather conditions, and other operating risks. Please see Newfield’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent public filings, all filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for a discussion of other factors that may cause actual results to vary. Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed herein or in Newfield’s SEC filings could also have material adverse effects on actual results. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this presentation. Unless legally required, Newfield undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. This presentation has been prepared by Newfield and includes market data and other statistical information from sources believed by Newfield to be reliable, including independent industry publications, government publications or other published independent sources. Some data are also based on Newfield’s good faith estimates, which are derived from its review of internal sources as well as the independent sources described above. Although Newfield believes these sources are reliable, it has not independently verified the information and cannot guarantee its accuracy and completeness. Actual quantities that may be ultimately recovered from Newfield’s interests may differ substantially from the estimates in this presentation. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of Newfield’s ongoing drilling program, which will be directly affected by commodity prices, the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors, and actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates. Newfield may use terms in this presentation, such as “EURs”, “upside potential”, “net unrisked resource”, “gross EURs”, and similar terms that the SEC’s guidelines strictly prohibit in SEC filings. These terms include reserves with substantially less certainty than proved reserves, and no discount or other adjustment is included in the presentation of such reserve numbers. Investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in Newfield’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent public filings, available at www.newfield.com, www.sec.gov or by writing Newfield at 4 Waterway Square Place, Suite 100, The Woodlands, Texas 77380 Attn: Investor Relations. In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures, which include, but are not limited to, Adjusted EBITDA. Newfield defines EBITDA as net (loss) income before income tax (benefit) expense, interest expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, is EBITDA before ceiling test impairments, gains on asset sales, non-cash compensation expense and net unrealized (gains) / losses on commodity derivatives. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not represent net income as defined under GAAP, and should not be considered an alternatives to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure used by Newfield’s management and by securities analysts, lenders, ratings agencies and others who follow the industry as an indicator of Newfield’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities. 11
