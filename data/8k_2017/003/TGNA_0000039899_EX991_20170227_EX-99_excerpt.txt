McLEAN, VA - TEGNA Inc. (NYSE: TGNA) today reported GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.61 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.74, a 39.6 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.

Gracia Martore, president and chief executive officer, said, “2016 was a record year for TEGNA, capped by a strong fourth quarter despite a highly unusual presidential election season. Non-GAAP earnings per share were 40 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased 62 percent year-over-year. Total company revenues for both the quarter and the year were up 10 percent, boosted by record results across TEGNA Media. Higher retransmission revenues and political spending helped Media revenues grow 14 percent in the fourth quarter and reach a record level. While political spending on the presidential race was lower than predicted, TEGNA Media’s strong geographic footprint and increased non-presidential spending enabled the company to capture a large share of the overall broadcast political spend. Across TEGNA Digital, total revenues at Cars.com increased nearly five percent in the quarter thanks to the acquisition of DealerRater and an increase in display advertising revenues. CareerBuilder's revenue growth in the quarter were the best results of the year as the company continued its integration of two recent acquisitions, Aurico and Workterra. CareerBuilder also saw positive results in its resume database, employer services products and human capital software solutions.” 

Martore continued, “We continue to make progress toward our planned spin-off of Cars.com and strategic review of CareerBuilder as we move ahead on evaluating strategic alternatives for the businesses. In every decision we make, we are driving the company forward and maximizing return for our investors. Our businesses remain strong and are well positioned for growth in 2017.”

FOURTH QUARTER

CONTINUING OPERATIONS

The following table summarizes the year-over-year changes in continuing operations for both GAAP and non-GAAP measures (in thousands). 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total company revenues increased 10.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 driven by revenue growth in both the Media Segment and Digital Segment. 

On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were up 7.2 percent primarily due to higher Media Segment expenses. Corporate expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $15.9 million. Excluding special items, corporate expenses were $14.3 million (see Table 4).

Reported operating income declined 14.4 percent compared to the fourth quarter in 2015 while on a non-GAAP basis, operating income was 16.6 percent higher. Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA was 14.6 percent lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. On a non-

(more)

GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA was up 34.4 percent. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure detailed in Table 4) totaled $349.8 million, an increase of 15.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter in 2015. The Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter equaled 39.4 percent, 1.6 percentage points higher than the same quarter last year. 

Special items in the fourth quarter of 2016 unfavorably impacted GAAP results by $0.13 per share due primarily to non-cash impairments, facility consolidation, severance and other expenses primarily related to the potential spin-off of Cars.com and strategic review of CareerBuilder (refer to Table 3 for a reconciliation of results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis). 

FOURTH QUARTER

TEGNA MEDIA

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed our financial reporting cycle to a calendar year-end, which resulted in our fourth quarter of 2016 having three fewer days than the same quarter in 2015. The extra days in the fourth quarter of 2015 contributed approximately $11 million to Media Segment revenues.

The following table summarizes the year-over-year changes in select Media Segment revenue categories (in thousands). 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Media Segment revenues reached a record $529.1 million in the quarter, a 14.5 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter in 2015. Excluding the extra days in the fourth quarter last year, Media Segment revenues would have been up 17.3 percent. The growth was driven by an $80.2 million increase in political advertising and a $25.5 million increase in retransmission revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decline in core advertising due to the displacement effect of political advertising in the quarter. Excluding the extra days in the fourth quarter last year, core advertising revenues would have been approximately 11.0 percent lower reflecting, in part, political displacement. 

Media Segment operating expenses were $292.6 million compared to $261.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase was due primarily to higher programming fees and continued investment in growth initiatives. Operating income was $236.5 million, an increase of 17.9 percent compared to $200.7 million in the fourth quarter in 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the quarter was 17.6 percent higher and totaled $243.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $261.2 million, an increase of 16.4 percent resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 49.4 percent in the quarter.

(more)

Based on current trends, we expect Media Segment revenue in the first quarter of 2017 to be flat to slightly above the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year comparison will be unfavorably impacted by substantially lower political advertising revenue ($16 million in the first quarter of 2016) and the move of the Super Bowl to our 3 small FOX stations in 2017 from our 11 CBS stations in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable impact of the Super Bowl shift (approximately $9 million) and lower politically-related advertising, the percentage increase in Media Segment revenues is expected to be up in the mid-single digits in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. 

FOURTH QUARTER

TEGNA DIGITAL

Digital Segment revenues rose 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter reflecting $7.4 million in revenue growth at Cars.com and a $10.1 million revenue increase at CareerBuilder offset, in part, by the impact of the sale of the PointRoll business in November 2015. 

Total revenues at Cars.com were 4.8 percent higher in the fourth quarter. Cars.com revenues sold directly by the company were up 7.5 percent driven by the acquisition of DealerRater and an increase in display advertising revenues and higher lead spending by auto manufacturers. Wholesale revenues (fees paid by newspaper affiliates) were 2.5 percent lower in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter in 2015. 

CareerBuilder revenues grew 5.9 percent (6.9 percent on a constant currency basis) in the fourth quarter, a significant sequential improvement from the growth rate in the third quarter and the best quarterly revenue growth of the year. CareerBuilder results reflect continued growth in its resume database and employer services products and human capital software solutions as well as the acquisitions of Aurico and Workterra. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in job site advertising.

Digital Segment operating expenses totaled $299.1 million, an increase of 3.5 percent. The increase reflects primarily the acquisitions of Aurico and Workterra and higher cost of sales in support of revenue growth at CareerBuilder, partially offset by the impact of the disposition of PointRoll. Digital Segment operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis were 4.2 percent higher compared to the fourth quarter in 2015. 

Digital Segment operating income was $59.2 million. Excluding special items, non-GAAP operating income was $69.0 million, an increase of 5.6 percent compared to the fourth quarter in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $102.7 million resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.7 percent.

FOURTH QUARTER

NON-OPERATING AND CASH FLOW ITEMS

Interest expense totaled $56.6 million in the quarter, a decline of $10.2 million from $66.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, due to lower average debt outstanding and a lower average interest rate. On November 1, 2016, we opportunistically redeemed at par the remaining $70 million of 7.125 percent notes outstanding that were to mature in September 2018 generating a total net reduction of interest expense of approximately $5 million through the original maturity.

Other non-operating expense was $9.2 million, an increase of $3.0 million from the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting primarily expenses associated with the anticipated spin-off of Cars.com and strategic review of CareerBuilder. Other non-operating income on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.9 million compared to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

(more)

Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $228.7 million. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure - Refer to Table 5) totaled $202.4 million for the quarter. Long-term debt outstanding was $4.0 billion and total cash was $76.9 million at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 497,621 shares of our outstanding stock for $11.0 million. Dividends paid in the quarter totaled $30.0 million. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.2 percent on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 30.7 percent reflecting the benefit of various tax planning initiatives and the tax benefit of restricted stock units which vested in the quarter.

FULL YEAR 2016

CONTINUING OPERATIONS

Total operating revenues for the full year were $3.34 billion, an increase of 9.5 percent compared to 2015 reflecting revenue increases in the Media Segment and the Digital Segment. Media Segment revenues increased 14.9 percent compared to 2015 to a record $1.9 billion driven by a $133.4 million increase in political spending, advertising related to the Summer Olympics of $55.9 million and a 29.7 percent increase in retransmission revenue. Adjusting for the change to a calendar fiscal year, Media Segment revenues were up approximately 16 percent. Digital Segment revenues were 2.8 percent higher reflecting revenue growth of 6.1 percent at Cars.com and 2.3 percent at CareerBuilder. 

Operating expenses totaled $2.37 billion, an increase of 10.8 percent compared to 2015, reflecting higher expenses in the Media Segment and the Digital Segment and the gain on sale of the corporate headquarters in 2015 and offset partially by the absence of unallocated costs that impacted results in 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were up 5.0 percent to $2.31 billion primarily due to higher programming fees, expenses associated with revenue growth in the year and continued investment in growth initiatives at our Media Segment. Operating income totaled $972.1 million compared to $913.2 million in 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was 21.3 percent higher and totaled $1.03 billion while net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA was 54.7 percent higher.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1.23 billion in 2016 compared to $1.05 billion in 2015, an increase of 17.1 percent. The Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2016 was 36.9 percent, an increase of 2.3 percentage points from 34.6 percent in 2015.

USE OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION

The company uses non-GAAP financial performance and liquidity measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related GAAP measures, nor should they be considered superior to the related GAAP measures, and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Also, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Management and the company’s Board of Directors use the non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating business unit and consolidated company performance. Furthermore, the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow to evaluate management’s performance. The company, therefore, believes that each of the non-GAAP measures presented provides useful information to investors and other stakeholders by allowing them to view our business through the eyes of management and our Board of Directors, facilitating comparisons of results across historical periods and focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of our business. The company discusses in this report non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from its reported GAAP results the impact of “special items” consisting of severance expense, impairment charges on operating assets and equity investments, facility consolidation charges, gains related to building sales, gains/losses related to business disposals, expenses related to business acquisitions, costs associated with the company's spin-off transactions and benefits to our income tax provision. We also adjust net income attributed to noncontrolling interests to the extent any of the above items are related to our CareerBuilder business unit. The company believes that such expenses, charges and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations. Such items vary from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, while the company may incur or recognize these types of expenses, charges and gains in the future, management believes that removing these items for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of the company's ongoing operating performance.

The company also discusses Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance measure that it believes offers a useful view of the overall operation of its businesses. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA before (1) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, (2) interest expense, (3) income taxes, (4) equity income (losses) in unconsolidated investees, net, (5) other non-operating items such as spin-off transaction expenses, investment income and currency gains and losses, (6) severance expense, (7) facility consolidation charges, (8) impairment charges, (9) depreciation and (10) amortization. When Adjusted EBITDA is discussed in reference to performance on a consolidated basis, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Net income from continuing operations attributable to TEGNA. Management does not analyze non-operating items such as interest expense and income taxes on a segment level; therefore, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA when performance is discussed on a segment level is Operating income. Users should consider the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary expenditures, as this measure does not consider certain cash requirements, such as working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual commitments, interest payments, tax payments and other debt service requirements. 

This earnings release also discusses free cash flow, a non-GAAP liquidity measure. Free cash flow is defined as “net cash flow from operating activities” as reported on the statement of cash flows reduced by “purchase of property and equipment”. The company believes that free cash flow is a useful measure 

for management and investors to evaluate the level of cash generated by operations and the ability of its operations to fund investments in new and existing businesses, return cash to shareholders under the company’s capital program, repay indebtedness, add to the company’s cash balance, or use in other discretionary activities. Management uses free cash flow to monitor cash available for repayment of indebtedness and in its discussions with the investment community. Like Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management’s discretionary use.

Tabular reconciliations for all of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the following tables.

Note: Starting in second quarter of 2016, the company revised the method for computing Adjusted EBITDA to no longer treat non-cash rent as a reconciling item. The first quarter 2016 number was updated to conform to this new method that resulted in a $1.6 million reduction to our previously reported first quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA. This change also reduced Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 by $1.6 million.
