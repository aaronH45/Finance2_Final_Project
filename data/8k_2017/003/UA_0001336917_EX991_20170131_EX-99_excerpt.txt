“We are incredibly proud that in 2016, we once again posted record revenue and earnings, however, numerous challenges and disruptions in North American retail tempered our fourth quarter results,” said Kevin Plank, Under Armour Chairman and CEO. “The strength of our Brand, an unparalleled connection with our consumers and the continuation of investments in our fastest growing businesses -- footwear, international and direct-to-consumer -- give us great confidence in our ability to navigate the current retail environment, execute against our long-term growth strategy and create value to our shareholders.”

2017 Outlook

"Looking forward, our successful track record of re-defining performance gives us great confidence that the opportunities for long-term growth at Under Armour have never been greater,” said Plank. “The current environment represents an inflection point to maximize our unique strengths by staying on offense -- investing smartly in innovation, deepening our Brand connection with consumers and amplifying our focus on operational excellence -- positioning Under Armour as a stronger company."

Key points related to Under Armour’s full year 2017 outlook include:

•Net revenues are expected to grow 11 to 12 percent to reach nearly $5.4 billion, up 12 to 13 percent currency neutral. 

•Gross margin is expected to be slightly down compared to the prior year with benefits in product costs being offset by continued pressure from changes in foreign currency and sales mix, as the footwear and international businesses continue to outpace the growth of the higher margin apparel and North American businesses.

•Tempered top line results coupled with strategic investments in the company’s fastest growing businesses are expected to cause a decline in operating income to approximately $320 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). However, this press release refers to “non-GAAP diluted earnings per share” and certain “currency neutral” financial information, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the end of this press release for this reconciliation.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is calculated to exclude the one-time dividend to our Class C stockholders discussed above. Management believes this presentation provides a useful metric to investors because it excludes the effect of this one-time event allowing investors to compare the Company’s results over multiple periods. Currency neutral financial information is calculated to exclude foreign exchange impact. Management uses this information internally to assess sales performance and believes this information is useful both internally and to investors to facilitate a comparison of the Company's results of operations period-over-period. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation and should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company's non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
