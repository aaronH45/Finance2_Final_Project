Explanatory Note  

On February 9, 2017, Expedia, Inc. issued an earnings release announcing its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. A copy of the earnings release was furnished with a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 9, 2017 (the “Original 8-K”). This Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A is being filed to amend Items 2.02 and 9.01 of the Original 8-K, solely for the purpose of correcting an error related to the percentage impacts of acquisitions on non-GAAP expense category growth in the earnings release, as described below.  

 Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On February 9, 2017, Expedia, Inc. (the “Company”) issued an earnings release announcing its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 (the “Original Earnings Release”). Information regarding the percentage impacts of acquisitions on non-GAAP expense category growth for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 was misstated in the Original Earnings Release due to a calculation error. On February 21, 2017, the Company issued a corrected earnings release including such information, as corrected (the “Corrected Earnings Release”). The calculation error did not impact any of the Company’s other earnings release disclosures, including, but not limited to, reported Gross Bookings, Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Net Income, nor was there any impact to the Company’s GAAP financial statements.  

A copy of the Corrected Earnings Release, which indicates the corrected percentages on pages 8 and 9, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A and for convenience the corrected percentages are also excerpted below (with original reported percentage struck and corrected percentage in bold type).

The Corrected Earnings Release makes reference to non-GAAP financial measures and includes a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to General Instruction B.2. to Form 8-K, the information set forth in this Item 2.02 shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
