Item 8.01 Other Events

As previously reported, on February 8, 2017, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the “Company”) delivered an exercise notice (the “Put Notice”) under Section 3.1 of the put option agreement dated as of February 12, 2007 (the “Put Option Agreement”) among the Company, Glen Meadow ABC Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the “ABC Trust”), and Wilmington Trust Company (as successor to LaSalle Bank National Association) (“Wilmington”), as put option calculation agent. Pursuant to the Put Notice, the Company required the ABC Trust to purchase the Company’s junior subordinated notes (the “Notes”) for the designated amount of $500,000,000 on the terms set forth in the junior subordinated indenture, dated as of February 12, 2007, between the Company and Wilmington, as trustee. The settlement of the issuance of the Notes occurred on February 15, 2017.

In connection with the settlement of the transaction described above, the Company entered into a replacement capital covenant (the “RCC”), whereby the Company agreed for the benefit of certain of its debtholders named therein that it will not repay, redeem, defease or repurchase and will cause its subsidiaries not to purchase, as applicable, all or any portion of the Notes at any time prior to February 12, 2047 (or such earlier date on which the RCC terminates by its terms), except to the extent that the principal amount repaid or defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed the applicable percentage set forth in the RCC of the qualifying proceeds from the sale of certain replacement capital securities as set forth in the RCC. The RCC also prohibits the Company from redeeming all or any portion of the Notes on or prior to February 15, 2022. The foregoing description of the material terms of the RCC is qualified in its entirety by reference to the RCC, which is incorporated by reference herein and attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this report.
