2017 Outlook Reflects Durable Economic Recovery 

with Increasing Demand and Solid Pricing  

RALEIGH, North Carolina (February 14, 2017) – Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) today reported record results for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2016. 

For the fourth quarter of 2016, Martin Marietta achieved net sales of $889.0 million compared with $780.8 million in the 2015 fourth quarter; EBITDA was $229.7 million compared with $204.4 million; and earnings per diluted share were $1.55 compared with $1.26.  

For the full year, net sales were $3.58 billion compared with $3.27 billion in 2015; EBITDA was $971.6 million compared with $750.7 million; and earnings per diluted share were $6.63 compared with $4.29, up nearly 55 percent. 

Ward Nye, Chairman, President and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated:  

As demonstrated by our fourth-quarter and full-year results, we continue to capitalize on the economic recovery occurring in virtually all of our segments and geographies. We delivered record net sales, gross profit, net earnings and earnings per diluted share for both the fourth quarter and full year – building on the record results delivered in 2015 and the first three quarters of 2016. Looking ahead, we expect continued and accelerating growth in all three of the Company’s primary construction end-uses, and our leading market positions will allow us to continue benefitting from these opportunities in 2017 and beyond. We are highly confident that a durable, multi-year construction recovery is now underway, consistent with third-party forecasts.  

We are encouraged by the emerging bipartisan dialogue in Washington regarding the need for substantial investment in our nation’s infrastructure. We believe the new Administration and Congress should ensure increased, sustainable infrastructure funding commensurate with the nation’s clear, underlying needs. While the specific terms and timing of any proposed legislation is unclear, we believe momentum is building toward Executive and Congressional action in the near-term. Given the uncertainty associated with any potential infrastructure-related legislation, we have not factored any future benefits that might accrue to Martin Marietta into the guidance we are providing today.

Every business across our enterprise continues to make meaningful contributions to the Company’s enhanced profitability. The Southeast Group and the West Group saw gross profit increase 67 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Notably, the accelerating recovery in North Carolina and South Carolina contributed to the 19 percent gain in the Mid-America Group’s gross profit. These results are reflective of the soundness of our strategic planning together with market-specific execution. 

Our financial results reflect the improving economic environment as well as operational excellence. Our record results, coupled with our significant share price appreciation, led to increased performance-based incentive compensation. As a result, both fourth-quarter and full-year earnings per diluted share reflect increased incentive compensation expense that reduced earnings per share by $0.12 and $0.14, respectively. 

Full-year aggregates product line volume growth of nearly one-and-a-half percent reflects increases in both nonresidential and residential demand. Importantly, these results were achieved despite some notable hindrances during the year, including Texas Department of Transportation project delays, reduced energy-sector shipments, lower railroad ballast demand and the effect of abnormally wet weather leading to challenging operating and market conditions, including the impact of Hurricane Matthew on our fourth-quarter. Our ability to deliver growth, despite external headwinds, highlights and reaffirms that the fundamental drivers of a broad-based construction recovery remain firmly intact. In addition to benefitting from a modest increase in shipments, full-year aggregates product line pricing increased more than 7 percent which, together with disciplined cost control, generated a 26 percent increase in gross profit and a 330-basis-point improvement in consolidated gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues).  

Steady domestic employment growth remains a stimulus for construction activity. For the trailing 12-months ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. added 2.2 million jobs, with more than 12 million jobs added over the last five years. Importantly, many of our top states lead the nation in job growth, including Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Positive employment gains, in addition to substantial contractor backlogs enhanced by historic rainfall during the last 24 months, should continue to fuel broad-based demand growth. With much of our southeastern businesses operating at less than 70 percent of productive capacity, increased demand in these markets will generate operating leverage and further earnings growth. 

We expect infrastructure demand to be meaningfully and positively impacted by the $305 billion Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) as well as multiple state initiatives. Longer term, infrastructure spending is expected to benefit from strong state and local support for increased funding, as evidenced by the significant number of state and local transportation funding-related ballot initiatives that have passed over the previous 24 months. Private-sector construction indicators also signal continued growth for both nonresidential and residential activity. 

We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and cash dividends. Consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we have returned nearly $1.0 billion to our shareholders since announcing our 20 million share buyback authorization in February 2015. As we have consistently demonstrated, Martin Marietta will remain diligent in thoughtfully balancing our capital allocation between investing in the business and returning cash to shareholders.  

By almost any meaningful measure, 2016 was a remarkable year. Record financial performance delivered a 64 percent total shareholder return, the ninth best in the S&P 500. We continue to focus not only on the operations of the Company, but on the best practices needed to make Martin Marietta not just the best aggregates company, but rather one of the world’s best companies. Our Company performance, coupled with the achievement of key strategic goals, not only delivered results in 2016, but established an enhanced solid foundation for continued performance and delivery of shareholder value.

Looking to the year ahead, we expect our key profit drivers – pricing, volume and cost – to remain positive. As a result, we are beginning 2017 with the strongest profitability and cash generation outlook we have ever seen. Our expectation for continued momentum in 2017 and beyond is underpinned by our highly skilled employees, who maintain a relentless commitment to industry-leading safety standards. Our enduring performance is evidence that Martin Marietta is strategically aligned with premier market positions to further increase long-term shareholder value.

QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS (All comparisons are versus the prior-year period unless noted otherwise) 

Aggregates Business  

For the full year, shipments to the infrastructure market comprised 39 percent of aggregates product line volumes. As expected, infrastructure construction activity saw little benefit in 2016 from passage of the FAST Act. This, coupled with project delays, primarily in Texas, and continued significant rainfall during the year, led to a year-over-year decline in infrastructure volume. 

The nonresidential market represented 32 percent of full-year aggregates product line shipments and increased 3.0 percent as compared with 2015. The Mid-America Group led this growth with a 21.2 percent increase, and the Southeast Group achieved a 3.1 percent increase. Steady economic improvement across the southeastern United States is driving gains in office, retail and industrial development in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. The West Group was negatively impacted by weather deferrals and lower energy-sector demand.  

The residential market accounted for 21 percent of aggregates product line shipments for the year. Volumes to this segment increased 21.6 percent, driven by continued strength in housing. The Mid-America Group and West Group achieved growth of 23.8 percent and 23.3 percent, respectively. With 2016 national housing starts of 1.17 million, still well below historical averages, the positive trends in housing construction in the Company’s top states indicate continued growth in 2017. Florida, Georgia and Colorado are ranked in the top 10 states for gains in housing starts. Additionally, on the metro-level, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City, Austin and Colorado Springs all experienced double-digit growth in housing starts and rank in the top 10 for 2016.

February 14, 2017 

The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 8 percent of aggregates product line volumes. The volume decline in this segment for the year principally reflects lower capital and maintenance activity by railroads.  

Overall, aggregates product line shipments increased 0.4 percent and 1.4 percent for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2016, respectively. The full-year increase reflects a 6.5 percent improvement in the Mid-America Group, partially offset by project and weather delays in the Southeast Group and West Group.  

Full-year aggregates product line pricing increased in all reportable groups. The overall price improvement of 7.3 percent was in line with management’s expectations and led by a 10.6 percent increase in the West Group. The Southeast Group and Mid-America Group reported increases of 7.1 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. 

The aggregates product line’s gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) was 26.9 percent, an increase of 230 basis points, driven primarily by broad-based pricing growth and diligent cost control. 

The ready mixed concrete product line benefitted from strong demand, higher pricing and improved operating conditions. Inclusive of the operations acquired during the year, ready mixed concrete volumes increased 26.6 percent and average selling price increased 8.3 percent. The business leveraged sales growth into a 450-basis-point improvement in gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues).  

Cement Business 

The Cement business generated $364.4 million of net sales and $120.1 million of gross profit in 2016. For the full year, gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) was 33.0 percent, compared with 28.0 percent for 2015 (excluding the results of the divested California cement business), an improvement of 500 basis points. Despite the negative impacts from Texas Department of Transportation project delays and reduced construction activity in portions of south Texas, cement volumes increased 1.1 percent (excluding the results of the divested California cement business). The Company sees improving conditions in most Texas markets. The Portland Cement Association, or PCA, forecasts domestic demand in Texas to exceed local supply for the next several years.  

For the full year, cement kiln maintenance costs of $20.9 million were incurred, in line with management’s expectations.  

Magnesia Specialties Business 

Magnesia Specialties delivered record performance during the year and generated net sales of $238.0 million and $89.5 million of gross profit. Net sales increased 4.6 percent, primarily attributable to the chemicals product line. Steel capacity utilization was approximately 71 percent in 2016, relatively flat compared with the prior year, but slightly ahead of the 70 percent utilization level at which the business operates most effectively. Gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) for the full year expanded 300 basis points to 37.6 percent, benefitting from lower natural gas and kiln outage costs. Full-year earnings from operations were $79.1 million compared with $68.9 million in the prior year, an increase of nearly 15 percent. 

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS 

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for full-year 2016 were 6.9 percent of net sales, reflective of the increase in performance-based incentive compensation. Other operating income, net, for full-year 2016 was $8.0 million compared with other operating expenses, net, of $15.7 million in the prior year. The prior year reflects the impact of the divestitures of the California cement business and San Antonio asphalt operations. Earnings from operations for the year were $667.3 million in 2016 compared with $479.4 million in 2015, an increase of 39.2 percent.  

The estimated effective income tax rate was 30 percent, in line with management’s expectations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash provided by operating activities for 2016 was $678.7 million compared with $573.2 million in 2015. The increase is principally attributable to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.  

Property, plant and equipment additions for the year were $404 million, reflecting the acceleration of certain mobile fleet purchases in the fourth quarter. The equipment purchases, which should reduce maintenance and repair costs, were previously planned for 2017. Cash paid during the year for capital additions was $387 million.  

At December 31, 2016, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the Company’s credit agreements, for the trailing-12 months was 1.7 times, in compliance with the Company’s leverage covenant.  

COMMITMENT TO INCREASING SHAREHOLDER VALUE 

The Company is authorized to execute a share repurchase program under which it may acquire up to 20 million shares of its outstanding common stock. Repurchases are expected to be carried out through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated share purchase transactions or any combination of such methods. The Company expects to complete the repurchase program over the next several years, though the actual timing of completion will be based on an ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company’s common stock and general market conditions. Share repurchases will be undertaken based on then-current business and market factors; therefore, the actual return of capital in any single quarter may vary. The repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued by the Company at any time without prior notice.  

In the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 344,300 shares, returning $69.2 million to shareholders. Since announcing its repurchase authorization in February of 2015, the Company has repurchased 4.9 million shares and, including the payment of dividends, returned $992 million to shareholders. As of December 31, 2016, there were 63.6 million shares of Martin Marietta common stock outstanding and 15.1 million shares remaining under the current repurchase authorization.  

FULL-YEAR 2017 OUTLOOK 

The Company is encouraged by positive trends in the markets it serves and its ability to execute its strategic business plans. Notably:   

•  

For the public sector, continued growth is expected in 2017 as new monies begin to flow into the system. FAST Act projects should accelerate through the year, supported by ongoing projects funded through the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA). Additionally, state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects, including the state and local ballot initiatives passed over the past 24 months, are expected to grow and continue to play an expanded role in public-sector activity. 

•  

Nonresidential construction is expected to modestly increase in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors. The Dodge Momentum Index is at its highest level since 2009, which signals continued growth. Additional energy-related economic activity, including follow-on public and private construction activity, will be mixed. While $47 billion of new energy-related projects are scheduled to start in 2017 and 2018, the certainty and timing of commencement will affect nonresidential growth.  

•  

Residential construction is expected to continue growing, driven by employment gains, historically low levels of construction activity over the previous several years, low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption and higher multi-family rental rates.

Based on these trends and expectations, including a return to more normal weather patterns, the Company anticipates the following for the full year:  

•  

Aggregates end-use markets compared with 2016 levels are as follows:  

•Infrastructure market to increase mid-single digits.  

•Nonresidential market to increase in the low- to mid-single digits.  

•Residential market to increase in the mid- to high-single digits. 

•ChemRock/Rail market to remain stable.

RISKS TO OUTLOOK 

The 2017 outlook includes management’s assessment of the likelihood of certain risks and uncertainties that will affect performance, including but not limited to: both price and volume; the United States Congress’ inability to reach agreement among themselves or with the current Administration on policy issues, including the nature, extent and/or timing of infrastructure funding, that impact the federal budget; the termination, capping and/or reduction of state gasoline tax(es) or other state revenue related to infrastructure construction; the volatility in the commencement of infrastructure projects; a reduction in defense spending, and the subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases; a decline in nonresidential construction; a further decline in energy-related construction activity resulting from a sustained period of low global oil prices or changes in oil production patterns in response to this decline and certain regulatory or other economic factors; a slowdown in the residential construction recovery; a reduction in economic activity in the Company’s Midwest states resulting from reduced funding levels provided by the Agricultural Act of 2014 and a sustained reduction in capital investment by the railroads; an increase in the cost of compliance with governmental laws, rules and regulations; construction labor shortages; and unexpected equipment failures, unscheduled maintenance, industrial accident or other prolonged and/or significant disruption to its cement and/or its Magnesia Specialties production facilities. The Magnesia Specialties business essentially runs at capacity; therefore, any unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers introduce volatility to the earnings of this segment. Cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations. 

The Company’s principal business serves customers in aggregates-related construction markets. This concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds normally posted on public projects, together with lien rights on private projects, mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables. The level of aggregates demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the Aggregates business and, therefore, profitability. Production costs in the Aggregates business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly. Diesel fuel and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts. Fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in the Company’s long-haul distribution network. The Cement business is also energy intensive and fluctuation in the price of coal affects costs. The Magnesia Specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas. 

Transportation in the Company’s long-haul network, particularly the supply of rail cars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains, affects the Company’s efficient transportation of aggregate into certain markets, most notably Texas, Colorado, Florida and the Gulf Coast. In addition, availability of rail cars and locomotives affects the Company’s movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals, to both the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan, and customers. The availability of trucks, drivers and railcars to transport the Company’s product, particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand, is also a risk and pressures the associated costs.  

All of the Company’s businesses are also subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability. The first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather. Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters. In fact, in early October 2016, Hurricane Matthew generated winds and significant amounts of rainfall disrupting operations from the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. However, after hurricane-related flood waters recede, management expects an increase in construction activity as roads, homes and businesses are repaired.

Risks to the outlook also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the Company’s control. In addition to the impact on nonresidential and residential construction, the Company is exposed to risk in its estimated outlook from interest cost related to its variable-rate debt. 

The Company’s future performance is also exposed to risks from tax reform at the federal and state levels.
