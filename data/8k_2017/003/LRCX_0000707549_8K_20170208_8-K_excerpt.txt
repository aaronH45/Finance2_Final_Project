Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On February 8, 2017, the Board of Directors of Lam Research Corporation (the “Company”) approved amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) primarily to implement proxy access. Article II, Section 2.16 has been added to the Bylaws to permit a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholders and the nominees satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws. Proxy access will first be available to stockholders in connection with the Company’s 2017 annual meeting. 

The Bylaws were also amended to make certain clarifications and refinements to the advance notice bylaw for nominations, contained in Article II, Sections 2.2 and 2.3, and to make certain other conforming, technical and administrative changes. 

The foregoing description of the Company’s Bylaws is qualified in all respects by reference to the text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
