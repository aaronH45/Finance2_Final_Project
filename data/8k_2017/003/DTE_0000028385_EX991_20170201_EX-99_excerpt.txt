Summary of DTE Electric Company Rate Order (Case U-18014)1 

February 1, 2017

On January 31, 2017, the Michigan Public Service Commission (“Commission” or “MPSC”) issued an order in DTE Electric’s (“DTE Electric”) rate case. This document provides a summary of the Commission’s order. The Commission’s full order is available on the MPSC’s website (http://efile.mpsc.state.mi.us/efile/) under case number U-18014.

The MPSC order authorized DTE Electric to raise base rates by $184.3 million and approved a return on equity (“ROE”) of 10.1%. The Commission directed DTE Electric to implement rate changes for service rendered on and after February 7, 2017.  

DTE Electric filed an application on February 1, 2016 with supporting direct testimony and exhibits initially seeking a general rate increase of approximately $344 million based on a projected twelve month test period ending July 31, 2017. The need for the rate increase was driven primarily by the Company’s capital investment of more than $900 million since the last general rate case to replace aging distribution system infrastructure and to invest in the Company’s long-term generation assets, lower sales, inflation and working capital increases due primarily to changes in retiree benefit costs.

Effective August 1, 2016, DTE Electric self-implemented a base rate increase of $245 million.
