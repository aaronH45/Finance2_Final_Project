Exhibit 99.1  

McKESSON REPORTS FISCAL 2017 THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS  

   •   Revenues of $50.1 billion for the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year.  

   •   Third-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.86, up 6% year-over-year.  

   •   Excluding Cost Alignment Plan charges of two cents from Adjusted Earnings, third-quarter results per diluted share of $3.05, down 4% compared to $3.18 in the prior year.  

   •   Fiscal 2017 Outlook: GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $9.80 to $10.30.  

   •   Fiscal 2017 Outlook: $12.60 to $12.90 per diluted share, which excludes approximately $1.28 to $1.30 in charges to Adjusted Earnings related to a goodwill impairment and the Cost Alignment Plan, up from previous outlook of $12.35 to $12.85.  

   •   Announced definitive agreement to acquire CoverMyMeds to strengthen our technology offerings to pharmaceutical manufacturers, clinicians and payers.  

SAN FRANCISCO, January 25, 2017 – McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the third quarter ended December 31, 2016, were $50.1 billion, up 5% compared to $47.9 billion a year ago. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), third-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.86, compared to $2.71 a year ago.  

Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings were $3.03 per diluted share. Third-quarter results included pre-tax charges totaling $4 million, or approximately two cents per diluted share, related to the company’s cost alignment plan disclosed in March 2016 (the “Cost Alignment Plan”). Third-quarter results primarily benefited from a lower tax rate, partially offset by a softer pricing environment in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions compared to the prior year.  

For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $3.3 billion, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion. Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson paid $4.2 billion for acquisitions, repurchased $2.0 billion of its common stock, repaid approximately $390 million in long-term debt, invested  

1  

 $369 million internally and paid $192 million in dividends. And our expectation for full-year cash flow from operations remains consistent with our original guidance.  

On January 24, 2017, McKesson entered into an agreement to acquire CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion, or $0.9 billion net of incremental cash tax benefits. The agreement also includes a maximum $0.3 billion of consideration contingent upon CoverMyMeds’ financial performance through the fiscal year ending 2019. CoverMyMeds is a privately-owned company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, that provides electronic prior authorization solutions to pharmacies, providers, payers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review, and is expected to close in the first half of Fiscal 2018.  

“I am pleased with our strong cash flow generation and our ability to deploy capital in meaningful and productive ways, particularly strategic acquisitions and share repurchases,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our announced acquisition of CoverMyMeds supports McKesson’s commitment to provide a comprehensive set of services and solutions that drive value across the healthcare continuum and secure patients’ access to their prescribed drugs. McKesson continues to further enhance its diverse suite of pharmaceutical technology solutions to support the very best in patient care.”  

Segment Results  

Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.4 billion for the quarter, up 5% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis.  

North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of $41.7 billion for the quarter were up 5% both on a reported and constant currency basis, primarily reflecting market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.  

International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.2 billion for the quarter, up 3% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis, driven by acquisitions and market growth.  

2  

Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 1% compared to the prior year both on a reported and constant currency basis.  

In the third quarter, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $813 million and GAAP operating margin was 1.64%. On a constant currency basis, third-quarter adjusted operating profit was $809 million, down 24% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 1.62%.  

Technology Solutions revenues of $0.7 billion were flat both on a reported and constant currency basis in the third quarter, primarily driven by an anticipated year-over-year decline in our hospital software business, offset by growth in our other technology businesses.  

Technology Solutions GAAP operating profit was $132 million for the third quarter and GAAP operating margin was 19.02%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was $168 million for the third quarter, up 26% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 24.24%.  

“Although we were unfavorably impacted in the third quarter by weaker branded pharmaceutical pricing than anticipated, we are updating our Fiscal 2017 outlook to reflect McKesson’s lower full-year effective tax rate,” continued Hammergren. “As a result, we now expect Adjusted Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $12.60 to $12.90 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017,” concluded Hammergren.  

Fiscal 2017 Outlook  

McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share between $9.80 to $10.30 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. Adjusted Earnings per diluted share excludes the following items:  

   •   Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $1.30 to $1.45 per diluted share;  

   •   Acquisition expenses and related adjustments of 65 cents to 75 cents per diluted share;  

   •   LIFO inventory-related credits of 60 to 70 cents per diluted share; and  

3  

   •   Claim and litigation reserve credits of one cent per diluted share for average wholesale price litigation matters.  

Excluding the second-quarter EIS goodwill impairment charge and an anticipated 2 to 4 cents in expected Cost Alignment Plan charges from Adjusted Earnings, McKesson expects $12.60 to $12.90 per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.  

The Fiscal 2017 guidance ranges do not include any potential claim or litigation reserve adjustments, or the impact of any potential new acquisitions and divestitures, or impairments and material restructurings beyond those previously publicly disclosed.  

Adjusted Earnings  

McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments reflecting the company’s reserves for controlled substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation matters, and Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.  

Constant Currency  

McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis. The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant

 currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company’s financial results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), McKesson Corporation (the “Company” or “we”) also presents the following non-GAAP measures in this press release. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company’s non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with business acquisitions by the Company.  

Acquisition expenses and related adjustments - Transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to business acquisitions and the proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange by the Company. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments, employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency contracts, and gains or losses on business combinations.  

Claim and litigation reserve adjustments - Adjustments to the Company’s reserves, including accrued interest, for estimated probable losses for its Controlled Substance Distribution Claims and the Average Wholesale Price litigation matters, as such terms are defined in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  

LIFO-related adjustments - Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments.  

Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Income Taxes,” which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company internally uses non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business worldwide in local currencies, including Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
