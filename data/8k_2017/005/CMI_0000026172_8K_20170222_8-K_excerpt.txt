The Ward 10b5-1 Plan allows for the exercise of options to purchase a maximum of 14,050 shares of Common Stock if the Common Stock reaches a specified market price during the period commencing sixty days after adoption of the Ward 10b5-1 Plan and continuing until the options to purchase all 14,050 shares have been exercised and the acquired shares sold, or February 22, 2018, whichever occurs first.

The Plans were designed to comply with the Company’s insider trading policies and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which permit an officer or director to enter into a pre-arranged plan for buying or selling Company stock at a time when the officer or director is not in possession of material, nonpublic information about the Company. Messrs. Ward, Freeland, Chapman, Linebarger and Satterthwaite will continue to be subject to the Company’s stock ownership guidelines, and the sales contemplated by the Plans will not reduce Messrs. Ward’s, Freeland’s, Chapman’s, Linebarger’s or Satterthwaite’s ownership of Common Stock below the levels required by the guidelines. 

All sales of Common Stock under the Plans will be disclosed publicly in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations through appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
