2017 Guidance

•Consolidated reported revenue growth of 1 to 2 percent;

◦IFS reported growth of 3 to 4 percent; and

◦GFS reported growth of 3 to 4 percent.

•Consolidated organic revenue growth of 2 to 3 percent;

◦IFS organic growth of 3 to 4 percent; and

◦GFS organic growth of 4 to 5 percent.

•Adjusted EPS of $4.15 to $4.30, an increase of 9 to 13 percent compared to $3.82 per share in 2016

FIS has not provided a reconciliation of the foregoing forward-looking guidance to the most comparable GAAP measures for Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EPS because such measures are not available at this time without unreasonable efforts. The significant impact of the SunGard acquisition, including among other things, the timing and amount of integration and severance costs, and the transition of systems, facilities and personnel, make it difficult to provide meaningful and comparable GAAP guidance.

Webcast

FIS will announce fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results on Tues., Feb. 7, prior to market open. The company will sponsor a live webcast of its earnings conference call with the investment community beginning at 8:30 a.m. (EST) Tues., Feb. 7. To access the webcast, go to the Investor Relations section of FIS’ homepage, www.fisglobal.com. A replay will be available after the conclusion of the live webcast.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures.

These non-GAAP measures include adjusted revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted combined revenue, adjusted combined EBITDA, adjusted combined EBITDA margin, constant currency revenue, organic revenue growth, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (including per share amounts), adjusted cash flow from operations, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures may be used in this release and/or in the attached supplemental financial information.

We believe these non-GAAP measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals of our business. As further described below, the non-GAAP revenue and earnings measures presented eliminate items management believes are not indicative of FIS’s core operating performance. The “adjusted combined” revenue and earnings measures additionally provide information that adjusts for our acquisition of SunGard in November 2015, to improve comparability across reporting periods. The “constant currency” and “organic revenue” measures adjust for the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, while organic revenue also adjusts for acquisitions and divestitures, giving investors further insight into our core performance. Finally, the non-GAAP cash flow measures provide further information about the ability of our business to generate cash. For these reasons, management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its assessment and management of FIS’s performance.

Adjusted revenue consists of reported revenue, increased to reverse the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment made upon the acquisition of SunGard. The deferred revenue adjustment represents revenue that would have been recognized in the normal course of business by SunGard under GAAP but was not recognized due to GAAP purchase accounting adjustments. The deferred revenue adjustment in purchase accounting was made entirely in the Corporate and Other segment; reported GAAP results for the IFS and GFS segments are not affected by this adjustment and, therefore, no adjusted revenue is presented for these segments.

EBITDA reflects earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 

Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods. This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.

Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted revenue.

Adjusted combined revenue includes reported revenue for FIS and SunGard combined for pre-acquisition periods in 2015 and excludes the impacts of SunGard businesses that were divested prior to SunGard being purchased by FIS. 

Adjusted combined EBITDA includes EBITDA for FIS and SunGard combined for pre-acquisition periods in 2015 and excludes certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, such as purchase accounting amortization, acquisition, integration and severance costs and restructuring costs, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods.

Adjusted combined EBITDA margin reflects adjusted combined EBITDA divided by adjusted combined revenue.

Constant currency revenue represents (i) adjusted revenue in respect of the consolidated results and the corporate and other segment and (ii) reported revenue in respect of the IFS and GFS segments, in each case excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the current period.

Organic revenue growth is constant currency revenue, as defined above, for the current period compared to an adjusted revenue base for the prior period which consists of adjusted combined revenue, further adjusted to exclude revenue of any divestitures by FIS and include pre-acquisition revenue for companies acquired by FIS, in addition to SunGard, during the applicable reporting period.

Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations excludes the impact of certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods. It also excludes the impact of acquisition-related purchase accounting amortization, which is recurring.

Adjusted net earnings per diluted share, or Adjusted EPS, reflects adjusted net earnings from continuing operations divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

Adjusted cash flow from operations reflects GAAP cash flow from operations as adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations, and excludes certain transactions that are closely associated with non-operating activities or are otherwise non-operational in nature and not indicative of future operating cash flows.

Free cash flow reflects adjusted cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure.

Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Further, FIS’ non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures, including footnotes describing the specific adjustments, are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS web site, www.fisglobal.com

SUPPLEMENTAL GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION — UNAUDITED

(In millions)

Notes to Unaudited - Supplemental GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

The adjustments are as follows:

(1)This item represents purchase price amortization expense on all intangible assets acquired through various Company acquisitions, including customer relationships, contract value, trademarks and tradenames, and non-compete agreements. Beginning with the November 2015 acquisition of SunGard, this column also includes the amortization associated with purchase price adjustments to technology assets acquired. As of December 31, 2016, the allocation of purchase price for SunGard to assets and liabilities is final and no adjustment in future periods is expected.

(2)This item represents certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational primarily related to integration and severance activity from the SunGard acquisition.

(3)This item represents the impact of the purchase accounting adjustment to reduce SunGard's deferred revenues to estimated fair value, determined as fulfillment cost plus a normal profit margin. The deferred revenue adjustment represents revenue that would have been recognized in the normal course of business by SunGard under GAAP if the acquisition had not occurred, but was not recognized due to GAAP purchase accounting requirements. 

(4)Global Restructure represents severance costs incurred during the first quarter of 2015 in connection with the reorganization and streamlining of operations in our Global Financial Solutions segment.

(5)This item represents the write-off of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs and the payment associated with the early termination of certain interest rate swaps resulting from the repayment of amounts due under our credit facilities during the third quarter of 2016.

(6)This item represents the gain on the sale of check warranty contracts and other assets in the gaming industry. The sale did not meet the standard necessary to be reported as discontinued operations and, therefore, the gain and related prior period earnings remain reported within earnings from continuing operations. 

(7)The adjusted financial information of SunGard excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets, as well as the impact from the acquisition deferred revenue adjustment arising from the SunGard Acquisition as those impacts would be eliminated in the preparation of adjusted combined information. It also excludes (i) revenues and cost of revenues from businesses disposed of by SunGard in 2015 and (ii) SunGard's historical expense prior to its acquisition by FIS for amortization of purchased intangibles acquired by SunGard.
