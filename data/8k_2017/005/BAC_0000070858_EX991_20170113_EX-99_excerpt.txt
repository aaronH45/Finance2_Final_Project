Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, risk-weighted assets (RWA) and CET1 ratio as shown on a fully phased-in basis are non- GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of CET1 to fully phased-in, see page 13 of this press release. 4 Bank of America reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, which is the Advanced approaches for the periods presented. 5 Basel 3 fully phased-in Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As of December 31, 2016, BAC did not have regulatory approval for the IMM model. Common Stock Repurchase Program Increased In June 2016, Bank of America announced it would increase its common stock dividend by 50% to $0.075 per share and repurchase up to $5 billion of common stock in the period between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017 as part of its 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) submission. Today, the company announced plans to repurchase an additional $1.8 billion in common stock by June 30, 2017. The repurchase program, which covers both common stock and warrants, will be subject to various factors, including the company's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The common stock or warrant repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The company's authorized repurchases are net of shares awarded under its equity-based compensation plans.  

9 Endnotes A B C D E F G H The Corporation also measures net interest income on an FTE basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. FTE basis is a performance measure used in operating the business that management believes provides investors with a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. The Corporation believes that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $10.5 billion and $9.9 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. NII for the fourth quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted by $612 million related to adjustments for certain trust securities. NII excluding this impact represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 17-18 of this press release. Fully phased-in estimates are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to page 13 of this press release. Basel 3 fully phased-in Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As of December 31, 2016, BAC did not have regulatory approval for the IMM model. Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, limited to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions. Prior to the third quarter of 2016, GLS were referred to as “Global Excess Liquidity Sources. Time to required funding (TTF) is a debt coverage measure and is expressed as the number of months unsecured holding company obligations of Bank of America Corporation can be met using only the Global Liquidity Sources held at the BAC parent company and NB Holdings without the BAC parent company issuing debt or sourcing additional liquidity. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. Prior to the third quarter of 2016, the TTF metric incorporated only the GLS of the BAC parent company. Effective September 30, 2016, the TTF metric was expanded to include the GLS of NB Holdings, following changes in the Corporation’s liquidity management practices, initiated in connection with the Corporation’s resolution planning activities, that include maintaining at NB Holdings GLS previously held at the BAC parent company. For the period shown in 2015, we have included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations the liability, including estimated costs, for the previously announced BNY Mellon private-label securitization settlement. In Q1-16, settlement payment was made for $8.5B. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 17-18 of this press release. Rankings per Dealogic as of January 1, 2017 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, excluding self-led deals. U.S. municipal bonds ranking per Thomson Reuters. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital calculated on a fully phased-in basis. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Off-balance sheet exposures primarily include undrawn lending commitments, letters of credit, potential future derivative exposures and repo-style transactions. Global Markets revenue, excluding net debit valuation adjustments (DVA), and sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, are non-GAAP financial measures. Net DVA losses were $101 million, $127 million and $198 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. FICC net DVA losses were $98 million and $190 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Equities net DVA losses were $3 million and $8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Pretax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) is a non-GAAP financial measure. PPNR is total revenue, net of interest expense (on an FTE basis), less noninterest expense. Consumer Banking total revenue, net of interest expense (on an FTE basis) was $8.1 billion and $8.0 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Noninterest expense was $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on pages 17-18. (2) Period-end loan balances for Q4-16 exclude $9.2 billion of non-U.S. consumer credit card loans, which are included in assets of business held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet. (3) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation. (4) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by agreements (fully-insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate; purchased credit-impaired loans even though the customer may be contractually past due; nonperforming loans held-for-sale or accounted for under the fair value option. (5) Excluding non-U.S. consumer credit card allowance of $243 million and loans of $9.2 billion, Q4-16 allowance for loan and lease losses is $11.2 billion and allowance as a percentage of ending loans is 1.25%. (6) Regulatory capital ratios are preliminary. Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, risk-weighted assets (RWA) and CET1 ratio as shown on a fully phased-in basis are non-GAAP financial measures. (7) Bank of America reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, which is the Advanced approaches for the periods presented. (8) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders' equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders' equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible shareholders' equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on pages 17-18. (9) Fully phased-in estimates are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, see above. (10) Basel 3 fully phased-in Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As of December 31, 2016, the Corporation did not have regulatory approval for the IMM model. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

The Corporation presents related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, the Corporation uses the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds. The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. See the tables below and on page 18 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to financial measures defined by GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the three months ended December 31, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.
