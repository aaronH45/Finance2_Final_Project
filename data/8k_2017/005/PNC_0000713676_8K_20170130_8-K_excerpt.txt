On January 30, 2017, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) issued a press release announcing a $300 million increase in its common stock share repurchase programs for the four-quarter period ending June 30, 2017. This amount is in addition to the share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion during this period authorized as part of PNC’s 2016 capital plan under the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which included up to $200 million related to employee benefit plans. PNC’s board of directors authorized the increase and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System did not object to the additional amount of share repurchases.  

PNC’s common share repurchases may be executed through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and exact amount of repurchases will be based on market conditions and other factors.
