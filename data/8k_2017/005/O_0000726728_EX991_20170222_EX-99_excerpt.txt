CEO Comments 

“We are pleased with another year of solid results as our company continues to execute across all areas of the business,” said John P. Case, Realty Income’s Chief Executive Officer. “In 2016, we surpassed $1 billion in rental revenue by completing a record-high volume of property acquisitions and actively managing our portfolio to maximize value. These activities contributed to healthy AFFO per share growth of 5.1% to $2.88, which supported the payment of multiple dividend increases throughout 2016. Given the strong momentum we are seeing in our business, we increased the dividend at the beginning of 2017 by 6% compared to one year ago. For 2017, we are introducing AFFO per share guidance of $3.00 - $3.06, representing earnings growth of 4.2% - 6.3%.” 

“During 2016, we completed $1.86 billion in acquisitions, of which $786 million was completed during the fourth quarter, representing our most active year and quarter for property acquisitions in our company’s history. We achieved this volume while maintaining investment spreads well above our historical average. Our portfolio occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 98.3%, unchanged from the end of the prior quarter. We maintained this high level of occupancy while recapturing approximately 105% of expiring rent on 186 properties re-leased to existing or new tenants in 2016.” 

“Our balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape with approximately 72% of our market capitalization represented by equity. Additionally, our credit rating remains the highest in the net lease industry, providing us with outstanding financial flexibility and contributing to our distinct cost of capital advantage.”

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders 

Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $85.7 million, as compared to $76.2 million for the same quarter in 2015. Net income per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $0.33, as compared to $0.31 for the same quarter in 2015.

The calculation to determine net income for a real estate company includes impairments, gains on property sales and/or fair value adjustments on interest rate swaps. These items can vary from quarter to quarter and can significantly impact net income and period to period comparisons. 

Funds From Operations Available to Common Stockholders (FFO) 

FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 increased 12.3% to $199.8 million, as compared to $177.9 million for the same quarter in 2015. FFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 increased 8.5% to $0.77, as compared to $0.71 for the same quarter in 2015. 

FFO for 2016 increased 12.7% to $735.4 million, as compared to $652.4 million for 2015. FFO per share for 2016 increased 4.0% to $2.88, as compared to $2.77 for 2015. 

Adjusted Funds From Operations Available to Common Stockholders (AFFO) 

AFFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 increased 13.5% to $193.0 million, as compared to $170.0 million for the same quarter in 2015. AFFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 increased 10.3% to $0.75, as compared to $0.68 for the same quarter in 2015. 

AFFO for 2016 increased 13.8% to $736.4 million, as compared to $647.0 million for 2015. AFFO per share for 2016 increased 5.1% to $2.88, as compared to $2.74 for 2015. 

The company considers FFO and AFFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of a Real Estate Investment Trust’s (REIT’s) operating performance. Realty Income defines FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ (NAREIT’s) definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairments of real estate assets, and reduced by gains on property sales. AFFO further adjusts FFO for unique revenue and expense items, which the company believes are not as pertinent to the measurement of the company’s ongoing operating performance. Presentation of the information regarding FFO and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO in the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. In addition, FFO and AFFO should not be considered as measures of liquidity, our ability to make cash distributions, or our ability to pay interest payments. See the reconciliations of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and AFFO on pages six and seven of this press release.
