Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

Southwest Airlines Co. (the “Company”) is providing guidance regarding its financial and operational trends in conjunction with the presentation by Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, at the Stifel 2017 Transportation & Logistics Conference on February 15, 2017.

•Based on current bookings and revenue trends, the Company's forecast for its first quarter 2017 operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) continues to fall slightly below year ago levels; therefore its guidance for first quarter 2017 RASM to fall in the flat to down one percent range, as compared with first quarter 2016, remains unchanged. This represents a continued and sequential improvement from the 2.9 percent RASM year-over-year decline in fourth quarter 2016, which is an encouraging start to the year.

•Based on current cost trends and excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing expense, the Company continues to expect its first quarter 2017 unit costs to increase in the six to seven percent range1, year-over-year, and its annual 2017 unit costs to increase approximately three percent, year-over-year. Wage rate increases from amended union contracts are estimated to drive approximately four points of the first quarter 2017 unit cost outlook, and approximately three points, or substantially all, of this annual 2017 unit cost outlook. 

•Based on the Company’s fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of February 10, 2017, first quarter 2017 economic fuel costs are estimated to be approximately $2.00 per gallon2.

•The Company continues to expect its full year 2017 available seat miles (capacity) to increase approximately 3.5 percent, year-over-year, with approximately 2.5 points of the increase relating to its domestic growth.

•The Company continues to estimate its 2017 capital expenditures will be approximately $2.3 billion, and expects capital expenditures in 2018 to fall below this year's level. 

•The Company paid $62 million in dividends to Shareholders in January 2017 and expects to complete the fourth quarter 2016 $300 million accelerated share repurchase program by the end of this week.

The information furnished in this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

1Year-over-year projections do not reflect the potential impact of fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items in both years because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate those items or expenses or their impact to its financial statements in future periods, especially considering the significant volatility of the Fuel and oil expense line item. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort.

2Economic fuel cost projections do not reflect the potential impact of special items because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate the hedge accounting impact associated with the volatility of the energy markets or the impact to its financial statements in future periods. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort.
