Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)

(in millions, except as noted and per share amounts)

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of First Niagara Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company” or "First Niagara"), including its wholly owned subsidiary First Niagara Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), have been prepared using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information.

These consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for a full year presentation and certain disclosures have been condensed or omitted in accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In our opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in First Niagara's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 do not necessarily reflect the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. We reviewed subsequent events and determined that no further disclosures or adjustments were required. Amounts in prior period financial statements are reclassified whenever necessary to conform to the current period presentation. First Niagara and the Bank are referred to collectively as “we” or “us” or “our.”

Note 1. Business Combination

On August 1, 2016 (the "Acquisition Date"), KeyCorp acquired all of the outstanding common shares of the Company for total consideration of approximately $4.0 billion and thereby acquired First Niagara Bank N.A.'s approximately 390 branch locations across New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Massachusetts (the "Merger"). On October 7, 2016, First Niagara Bank, N.A. merged with and into KeyBank, with KeyBank as the surviving entity.

Each outstanding share of Company common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.680 KeyCorp common shares and $2.30 in cash, for a total per share value of $10.26, based on the $11.70 closing price of KeyCorp’s stock on July 29, 2016. In the aggregate, Company stockholders received 240 million shares of KeyCorp common stock. Also under the terms of the merger agreement, First Niagara employee stock options and restricted stock awards converted into options to purchase and receive KeyCorp common stock. These options and restricted stock awards had a fair value of $26 million on the date of acquisition. 

In addition, at the time of the Merger, each share of Company preferred stock was converted into the right to receive a share of KeyCorp preferred stock.

Direct costs related to the Merger were expensed as incurred and amounted to $38 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. These costs were primarily comprised of professional services fees, employee retention expenses, classification of compensation of certain personnel dedicated to merger integration efforts, as well as costs related to securing shareholder approval for the pending Merger.

Note 2. Investment Securities 

The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of our investment securities at the dates indicated are summarized as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The table below details certain information regarding our investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position at the dates indicated by the length of time those securities were in a continuous loss position:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

11

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We have assessed the securities in an unrealized loss position at June 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015 and determined that the declines in fair value below amortized cost were temporary. 

The Volcker Rule provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act restrict the ability of affiliates of insured depository institutions to sponsor or invest in private funds or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading. Although the Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012 and the final rules became effective April 1, 2014, in connection with the adoption of the final rules on December 10, 2013 by the responsible agencies, the Federal Reserve issued an order extending the period during which institutions have to conform their activities and investments to the requirements of the Volcker Rule to July 21, 2015. 

In connection with conforming our activities to the Volcker Rule, including the establishment of a compliance program by July 21, 2015, we engaged in an enterprise wide review and established a cross functional working group. Our Volcker Rule conformance efforts included the establishment of a corporate-wide compliance program, required for banks with assets over $10 billion, which reviews and monitors Volcker Rule compliance on an on-going basis.

A significant portion of our Volcker Rule conformance efforts included confirming that our activities are either excluded or exempted from the Volcker Rule. In areas where the Volcker Rule applies to our activities, including in connection with capital markets (e.g., risk mitigating hedging), residential lending (e.g., secondary mortgage originations) and certain other activities, Volcker Rule conformance is not anticipated to have a material impact. 

The Volcker Rule's potential impact on us is most significant in connection with Collateralized Loan Obligations ("CLOs") held in our investment securities portfolio. The issuance of the final Volcker Rule restricts our ability to hold debt securities issued by CLOs where our investment in these debt securities is deemed to be an ownership interest in a CLO and the CLO itself does not qualify for an exclusion in the final rule for loan securitizations. On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve Board announced it would give banking entities until July 21, 2016 to conform investments in covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 ("legacy covered funds"). The Board also announced its intention to act in 2016 to grant banking entities an additional one-year extension of the 

12

conformance period for legacy covered funds which together would extend until July 21, 2017 the time period for institutions to conform their ownership interests to the stated provisions of the final Volcker Rule.

For our CLOs subject to the Volcker Rule in an unrealized loss position, we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to hold these securities to recovery, which could be maturity as the Federal Reserve announcement extends the conformance period to July 2017 and we believe that other structural remedies are available to us to allow us to continue holding the bonds after the conformance period. 

In making the determination that the declines in fair value below amortized cost for the remainder of the portfolio were temporary, we considered some or all of the following factors: the period of time the securities were in an unrealized loss position, the percentage decline in comparison to the securities’ amortized cost, credit rating, the financial condition of the issuer and guarantor, where applicable, the delinquency or default rates of underlying collateral, projected collateral losses, projected cash flows and credit enhancement. If the level of credit enhancement is sufficient based on our expectations of future collateral losses, we conclude that we will receive all of the originally scheduled cash flows. If the present value of the cash flows indicates that we should not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security, we would consider the security to be other than temporarily impaired and write down the credit component of the unrealized loss through a charge to current period earnings. We do not intend to sell these securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity. 

Realized gains and losses related to our securities available for sale were as follows for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Scheduled contractual maturities of our investment securities at June 30, 2016 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

While the contractual maturities of our mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, asset-backed securities, and other securities generally exceed ten years, we expect the effective lives to be significantly shorter due to prepayments of the underlying loans and the nature of these securities. The duration of our investment securities portfolio increased to 3.6 years at June 30, 2016 from 3.3 years at December 31, 2015.

Note 3. Loans and Leases 

Overall Portfolio

Our loan portfolio is made up of two segments, commercial loans and consumer loans. Those segments are further segregated between our loans initially accounted for under the amortized cost method (referred to as “originated” loans) and loans acquired (referred to as “acquired” loans). Our commercial loan portfolio segment includes both business and commercial real estate loans. Our consumer portfolio segment includes residential real estate, home equity, indirect auto, credit cards, and other consumer loans.

Our loans and leases receivable consisted of the following at the dates indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a liability for unfunded loan commitments of $16 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we did not recognize a provision for credit losses related to our unfunded loan commitments. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized a release of provision for credit losses related to our unfunded commitments of $1 million. 

At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our home equity portfolio totaled $3.1 billion, of which $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion was in the first lien position as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We hold or service the first lien loan for approximately 10% of the remainder of the home equity portfolio that was in a second lien position as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

As of June 30, 2016, commitments to extend credit to related parties amounted to $41 million, and the outstanding balance of loans to related parties was $42 million.

Acquired loan portfolios

We have acquired loans in four acquisitions since January 1, 2009. All acquired loans were initially measured at fair value and subsequently accounted for under either Accounting Standards Codification Topic (“ASC”) 310-30 (Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality) or ASC 310-20 (Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs.) 

14

The outstanding principal balance and the related carrying amount of our acquired loans included in our Consolidated Statements of Condition were as follows at the dates indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following table presents changes in the accretable yield, which includes income recognized from contractual interest cash flows, for the dates indicated. Acquired lines of credit accounted for under ASC 310-20 are not included in this table. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Allowance for loan losses

We establish our allowance for loan losses through a provision for credit losses based on our evaluation of the credit quality of our loan portfolio. We segregate our loans between loans we originated which are accounted for under the amortized cost method (referred to as “originated” loans) and loans acquired (referred to as “acquired” loans), as acquired loans were originally recorded at fair value, which included an estimate of lifetime credit losses, resulting in no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. We continue to monitor and modify the level of our allowance for loan losses to ensure it is adequate to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio.

We determined our allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment as defined above. For our originated loans, the allowance for loan losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers pools of loans for which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for pools of loans is based on net historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar inherent risk characteristics and performance trends adjusted, as appropriate, for quantitative and qualitative risk factors specific to respective loan types. The second component covers loans that have been identified as impaired or are nonperforming as well as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”.)

We also maintain an allowance for loan losses on acquired loans when: (i) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, there is deterioration in credit quality subsequent to acquisition, and (ii) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-20, the inherent losses in the loans exceed the remaining credit discount recorded at the time of acquisition.

Our threshold for evaluating commercial loans individually for impairment is $1 million. Impaired loans to commercial borrowers with outstandings less than $1 million are pooled and measured for impairment collectively. 

15

Additionally, all loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"), regardless of dollar size, are considered impaired.

The following table presents the activity in our allowance for loan losses on originated loans and related recorded investment of the associated loans in our originated loan portfolio segment for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

16

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

17

The following table presents the activity in our allowance for loan losses and related recorded investment of the associated loans in our acquired loan portfolio for the periods indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

18

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Credit Quality

We monitor credit quality as indicated by various factors and utilize such information in our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The following sections discuss the various credit quality indicators that we consider.

Nonperforming loans

Our nonperforming loans consisted of the following at the dates indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The table below provides information about the interest income that would have been recognized if our nonperforming loans had performed in accordance with terms for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

19

Impaired loans

The following table provides information about our impaired originated loans including ending recorded investment, principal balance, and related allowance amount at the dates indicated. Loans with no related allowance for loan losses have adequate collateral securing their carrying value and in some circumstances have been charged down to their current carrying value based on the fair value of the collateral. The recorded investment of our impaired loans, less any related allowance for loan losses, was 70% and 64% of the loans’ unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

20

The following table provides information about our impaired acquired loans with no related allowance at the dates indicated. There were no impaired acquired loans with a related allowance at the dates indicated. The remaining credit mark is considered adequate to cover any loss on these balances. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes nonperforming purchased credit impaired loans.

21

The following table provides information about our impaired originated loans including the average recorded investment and interest income recognized on impaired loans for the periods indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

22

The following table provides information about our impaired acquired loans including the average recorded investment and interest income recognized on impaired loans for the periods indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes nonperforming purchased credit impaired loans.

Period end nonperforming loans differed from the amount of total impaired loans as certain TDRs, which are considered impaired loans, were accruing interest because the borrower demonstrated a consistent repayment record. Also contributing to the difference are nonperforming commercial loans less than $1 million and nonperforming consumer loans, which are not considered impaired unless they have been modified in a TDR as they are evaluated collectively when determining the allowance for loan losses. 

The following table is a reconciliation between nonperforming loans and impaired loans at the dates indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Includes nonperforming purchased credit impaired loans.

23

Credit Quality Indicators

The primary indicators of credit quality are delinquency status and our internal loan gradings for our commercial loan portfolio segment and delinquency status and current FICO scores for our consumer loan portfolio segment. 

The following tables contain an aging analysis of our loans by class at the dates indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

24

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Includes credit card loans, loans that have matured and are in the process of collection, and acquired loans that were originally recorded at fair value upon acquisition. Acquired loans are considered to be accruing as we can reasonably estimate future cash flows on these acquired loans and we expect to fully collect the carrying value of these loans net of the allowance for acquired loan losses. Therefore, we are accreting the difference between the carrying value of these loans and their expected cash flows into interest income. 

25

Our internal loan risk assessment provides information about the financial health of our commercial borrowers and our risk of potential loss. The following tables present information about the credit quality of our commercial loan portfolio at the dates indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Includes special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss, which are consistent with regulatory definitions, and as described in Item 1, “Business,” under “Asset Quality Review” in First Niagara's Annual Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

26

Borrower FICO scores provide information about the credit quality of our consumer loan portfolio as they provide an indication as to the likelihood that a debtor will repay their debts. The scores are obtained from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency and are presented in the table below at the dates indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Primarily includes loans that are serviced by others for which refreshed FICO scores were not available as of the date indicated.

27

Troubled Debt Restructures

The following table details additional information about our TDRs at the dates indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The modifications made to loans classified as TDRs typically consist of an extension of the payment terms, providing for a period with interest-only payments with deferred principal payments, rate reduction, or loans restructured in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. We generally do not forgive principal when restructuring loans. 

The financial effects of our modifications are as follows for the periods indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

28

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Postmodification balances approximate premodification balances. The aggregate amount of charge-offs as a result of the restructurings was $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and was $2 million six months ended June 30, 2015.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

29

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The recorded investment in loans modified as TDRs within 12 months of the balance sheet date and for which there was a payment default was not significant for the six months ended June 30, 2016 or the six months ended June 30, 2015.

Residential Mortgage Banking

The following table provides information about our residential mortgage banking activities at the dates indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note 4. Derivative Financial Instruments

We are a party to derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to meet the needs of our customers. These financial instruments have been limited to interest rate swap agreements, which are entered into with counterparties that meet established credit standards and, where appropriate, contain master netting and collateral provisions protecting the party at risk. We believe that the credit risk inherent in all of our derivative contracts is minimal based on our credit standards and the netting and collateral provisions of the interest rate swap agreements.

Our derivative positions include both instruments that are designated as hedging instruments and instruments that are customer related and not designated in hedging relationships. The following table presents information regarding our derivative financial instruments at the dates indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Represents gross amounts, included in Other Assets in our Consolidated Statements of Condition.

(2) Represents gross amounts, included in Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Condition.

All of our interest rate swaps for which we had master netting positions with the counterparty were in a liability position at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Accordingly, there was no offsetting in our Consolidated Statements of Condition at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We posted collateral for liability positions with a fair value of $322 million and $195 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Derivatives designated in hedging relationships

We designate interest rate swap agreements used to manage changes in the fair value of loans due to interest rate changes as fair value hedges. We have designated the risk of changes in the fair value of loans attributable to changes in the benchmark rate as the hedged risk. Accordingly, changes to the fair value of the hedged items attributable to a change in credit risk are excluded from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The change in fair value of the derivatives, including both the effective and ineffective portions, is recognized in earnings and, so long as our fair value hedging relationships remain highly effective, such change is offset by the gain or loss due to the change in fair value of the loans attributable to the hedged risk. The net impact of the fair value hedging relationships on net income was not significant for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

31

We have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to variability in interest-related cash outflows attributable to changes in forecasted LIBOR based borrowings. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. We have designated the risk of changes in the amount of interest payment cash flows to be made during the term of the borrowings attributable to changes in the benchmark rate as the hedged risk. Accordingly, changes to the amount of interest payment cash flows for the hedged transactions attributable to a change in credit risk are excluded from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. Our interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges have maturities that correspond to the maturity of the forecasted hedged borrowing. Any gain or loss associated with the effective portion of our cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged forecasted transactions affects earnings. Any gain or loss associated with the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges, including ineffectiveness, is recognized immediately in earnings. At June 30, 2016, there was a $4 million loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these swaps.

At June 30, 2016, there was a $4 million loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income related to borrowings that were previously hedged using interest rate swaps that were classified as cash flow hedges. This amount will be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged borrowings as an adjustment of yield.

The following table presents certain information about amounts recognized for our derivative financial instruments designated in cash flow hedging relationships for the periods indicated. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Recognized in interest expense on borrowings in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivatives not designated in hedging relationships

In addition to our derivatives designated in hedging relationships, we act as an interest rate swap counterparty for certain commercial borrowers in the normal course of servicing our customers, which are accounted for at fair value. We manage our exposure to such interest rate swaps by entering into corresponding and offsetting interest rate swaps with third parties that mirror the terms of the interest rate swaps we have with the commercial borrowers. These positions (referred to as “customer swaps”) directly offset each other and our exposure is the positive fair value of the derivatives due to changes in credit risk of our commercial borrowers and third parties. We recognized revenue for this service that we provide our customers of $5 million and $14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, included in Capital Markets income in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

32

Note 6. Other Comprehensive Income

The following table presents the activity in our Other Comprehensive Income for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Included in Noninterest income in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

(2)  Included in Interest income on investment securities and other in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

34

(3) Included in Interest expense on borrowings our Consolidated Statements of Income.

The following table presents the activity in our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the next twelve months, we expect to reclassify $1 million of pre-tax net loss on previous cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings.

35

Note 7. Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Current accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the transparency of inputs participants use to price an asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes these inputs into the following three levels:

Level 1 Inputs—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are available at the measurement date.

Level 2 Inputs—Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.), or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data through correlation or other means.

Level 3 Inputs—Unobservable inputs for determining the fair value of the asset or liability and are based on the entity’s own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below.

Our valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While we believe our valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Securities Available for Sale

The fair value estimates of available for sale securities are based on quoted market prices of identical securities, where available (Level 1). However, as quoted prices of identical securities are not often available, the fair value estimate for almost our entire investment portfolio is based on quoted market prices of similar securities, adjusted for differences between the securities (Level 2). Adjustments may include amounts to reflect differences in underlying collateral, interest rates, estimated prepayment speeds, and counterparty credit quality. Where sufficient information is not available from the pricing services to produce a reliable valuation, we estimate fair value based on either broker quotes or internally developed models. We determine the fair value using third party pricing services, including brokers. As of June 30, 2016, none of our investment securities were priced utilizing broker quotes. For details regarding our pricing process and sources, refer to Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Income-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in First Niagara's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Loans held for sale

We have elected the fair value option for certain residential real estate loans held for sale as we believe the fair value measurement of such loans reduces certain timing differences in our Statement of Income and better aligns with our management of the portfolio from a business perspective. This election is made at the time of origination, on a loan by loan basis, and is irrevocable. The secondary market for securities backed by similar loan types is actively traded, which provides readily observable market pricing to be used as input for the estimate for the fair value of our loans. Accordingly, we have classified this fair value measurement as Level 2. Interest income on these loans is recognized in Interest Income—Loans and Leases in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

36

The table below presents information about our loans held for sale for which we elected the fair value option at the dates indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Additionally, included in loans held for sale on our Consolidated Statements of Condition are $3 million of commercial loans held for sale that are carried at the lower of cost or market at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Derivatives

We obtain fair value measurements of our interest rate swaps from a third party. The fair value measurements are determined using a market standard methodology of netting discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). Variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves. Credit valuation adjustments are incorporated to appropriately reflect our nonperformance risk as well as the counterparty’s nonperformance risk. The impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as bilateral collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees are also considered in the fair value measurement.

The fair value of our interest rate swaps was estimated using primarily Level 2 inputs. However, Level 3 inputs were used to determine credit valuation adjustments, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default. We have determined that the impact of these credit valuation adjustments was not significant to the overall valuation of our interest rate swaps. Therefore, we have classified the entire fair value of our interest rate swaps in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

37

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following tables summarize our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated:

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

The following table summarizes our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Collateral Dependent Impaired Loans

We record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to the carrying value of collateral dependent impaired loans when establishing the allowance for loan losses. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan less estimated costs to sell the collateral. When the fair value of such collateral, less costs to sell, is less than the carrying value of the loan, a specific allowance or charge off is recorded through a provision for credit losses. Real estate collateral is typically valued using independent appraisals that we review for acceptability, or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable in the marketplace and the related nonrecurring fair value measurements have been classified as Level 2. Under certain circumstances significant adjustments may be made to the appraised value due to the lack of direct marketplace information. Such adjustments are made as determined necessary in the judgment of our experienced senior credit officers to reflect current market conditions and current operating results for the specific collateral. When the fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans is based on appraisals containing significant adjustments, such collateral dependent impaired loans are classified as Level 3. We obtain new appraisals from an approved appraiser, in accordance with Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines and internal policy. Appraisals or evaluations for assets securing substandard rated loans are usually completed within 90 days of the downgrade. An appraisal may be obtained more frequently when volatile or unusual market conditions exist that could affect the ultimate realization of the value of the real estate collateral.

During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a decrease of $0.1 million to our specific allowance as a result of adjusting the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent impaired loans to $8 million at June 30, 2016, which is included in our provision for credit losses. During the six months ended June 30, 2015 we recorded an increase of $1 million to our specific allowance as a result of adjusting the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent impaired loans to $11 million at June 30, 2015, which is included in our provision for credit losses.

Level 3 Assets

Due to the lack of observable market data, we have classified our trust preferred securities, which are included in corporate debt securities and amounted to $4 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no changes in our trust preferred securities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair values of our trust preferred securities are based upon third party pricing without adjustment.

(1) For a detailed breakout of our investment securities available for sale, refer to our table of recurring fair value measurements.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our fair value estimates are based on our existing on and off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of any anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on our fair value estimates and have not been considered in these estimates.

Our fair value estimates are made as of the dates indicated, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments, including our judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in our assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Our fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set forth below for each type of financial instrument. The method of estimating the fair value of the financial instruments disclosed in the table above does not necessarily incorporate the exit price concept used to record financial instruments at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Condition or when measuring goodwill for impairment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because these instruments have original maturities of three months or less.

Investment Securities

The fair value estimates of securities are based on quoted market prices of identical securities, where available. However, as quoted prices of identical securities are not often available, the fair value estimate for almost our entire 

41

investment portfolio is based on quoted market prices of similar securities, adjusted for differences between the securities. Adjustments may include amounts to reflect differences in underlying collateral, interest rates, estimated prepayment speeds, and counterparty credit quality.

Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Common Stock

The carrying value of our Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank common stock, which are non-marketable equity investments, approximates fair value.

Loans and Leases

Our variable rate loans reprice as the associated rate index changes. The calculation of fair value for our variable rate loans is driven by the comparison between the loan’s margin and the prevailing margin observed in the market at the time of the valuation. Any caps and floors embedded in the loan’s pricing structure are also incorporated into the fair value. We calculated the fair value of our fixed-rate loans and leases by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using credit adjusted period end origination rates. Our estimate of maturity is based on the contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayment estimates based on current economic and lending conditions.

Accrued Interest Receivable and Accrued Interest Payable

The carrying value of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximates fair value.

Deposits

The fair value of our deposits with no stated maturity, such as savings and checking, as well as mortgagors’ payments held in escrow, is equal to the amount payable on demand. The fair value of our certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows, using the period end rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Borrowings

The fair value of our borrowings is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using period end market rates for borrowings of similar remaining maturities.

Commitments

The fair value of our commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees are not included in the above table as the carrying value generally approximates fair value. These instruments generate fees that approximate those currently charged to originate similar commitments.
