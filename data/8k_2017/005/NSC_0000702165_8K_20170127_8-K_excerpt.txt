 Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On January 23, 2017, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Norfolk Southern Corporation (“NS”) approved a retention award for Marta R. Stewart, the Company’s Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.

The award was granted in the form of time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), with Ms. Stewart receiving a grant of 2,080 RSUs. In general, the RSUs have a three-year restriction period that expires on January 26, 2020, and require that Ms. Stewart remain in active employment until September 30, 2018 (subject to earlier vesting in the event of death) to avoid forfeiture of the award.

The award was granted pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Restricted Stock Unit Award (“RSU Award Agreement”) which was approved by the Committee on January 23, 2017.

The foregoing is not a complete description of the RSU Award Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the RSU Award Agreement, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
