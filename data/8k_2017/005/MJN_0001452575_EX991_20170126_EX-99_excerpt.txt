•Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 19% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter as a result of the company's Fuel for Growth program.

"In the fourth quarter we continued to make progress with a series of important strategic transitions in key markets. Our imported products again grew strongly in China - and we doubled our sales volume via e-commerce out of Hong Kong over the prior quarter. Though it will take some time for us to complete the transition phase we are currently in, we are encouraged by early signs our plans are working", said Kasper Jakobsen, Chief Executive Officer.

(1) Constant dollar figures exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are reconciled in the tables in the body of this earnings release and in the schedules titled “Reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP Results.” Non-GAAP results exclude Specified Items.

Outlook 

For 2017, the company expects full year net sales to be in the range of -3% to 0% compared to 2016 on a reported basis, and in the range of -1% to +2% compared to 2016 on a constant dollar basis. Based upon recent spot rates, the estimated adverse foreign exchange impact is approximately 2%. Sales on a reported basis will be impacted by future foreign exchange changes which cannot be estimated. 

The company expects 2017 GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.20. GAAP EPS guidance includes estimated adverse foreign exchange impacts of approximately $0.20, based on recent spot rates. GAAP EPS will be impacted by future foreign exchange changes and potentially significant future specified mark-to-market pension adjustments which cannot be estimated. Specified Items such as charges related to Fuel for Growth and other items are estimated to be $0.10 in 2017. The company expects non-GAAP EPS of $3.35 to $3.50 on a constant dollar basis. 

Kasper Jakobsen continued, "2017 will see us complete our strategic transition program. We expect some pressure on both topline and costs in the beginning of the year, and the impact of currency and rising dairy costs will likely weigh on results. The impact will be partially offset by momentum behind productivity initiatives in both cost of goods and operating expenses. As previously stated, we expect only very modest growth in both Sales and EPS on a constant dollar basis - with performance strengthening through the second half of the year."

Financial Information (UNAUDITED)

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Results

This news release contains non-GAAP financial measures, each of which is listed in the tables below. The items included in GAAP measures, but excluded for the purpose of determining the non-GAAP financial measures, include significant income/expenses not indicative of underlying operating results, including the related tax effect and, at times, the impact of foreign exchange. The non-GAAP measures represent an indication of the company’s underlying operating results and are intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the company’s financial performance and ability to compare the company’s performance to that of its peer companies. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators the company uses as a basis for evaluating company performance, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting of future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that reconcile non-GAAP to GAAP disclosure follow below.

Constant Dollar 

Certain measures in this release are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange (constant dollar). To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. The company believes that these constant dollar measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-to-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. The primary currencies which impact the company are: the Argentine peso, the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, the Mexican peso and the Philippine peso. 

Specified Items

Non-GAAP measures presented within this release exclude Specified Items. The company considers Specified Items to be significant income/expense items as not indicative of underlying operating results, including the related tax effect. See below for a description of Specified Items and the related tax effect.

(a) Pension Remeasurement: When incurred, gains and losses related to the remeasurement of defined benefit pension and post-employment benefit plans are classified as Specified Items and excluded from non-GAAP performance measures. Pension remeasurement reflects changes in the pension assets and liabilities above what was estimated and included in periodic costs. Factors beyond our control such as changes in discount rates, market volatility and mortality assumptions drive the remeasurement amount. The majority of our pension and post-employment plans are frozen, and therefore the benefit provided to such employees is not related to our underlying operations. 

(b) Fuel for Growth: The Company approved a plan to implement a business productivity program referred to as “Fuel for Growth,” during the third quarter of 2015, which is anticipated to be implemented over a three-year period. Fuel for Growth is designed to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs. Fuel for Growth is expected to improve profitability and create additional investments behind brand building and growth initiatives. Fuel for Growth focuses on the optimization of resources within various operating functions and certain third party costs across the business.

(c) Investigation Accrual:  An accrual made in connection with the SEC settlement disclosed by the company in July 2015.

(d) Venezuela:  Foreign exchange losses, long-lived asset impairments and other asset write-offs in Venezuela.

(e) All Other: Primarily includes restructuring costs in 2016 and a marketable securities gain in 2015.
