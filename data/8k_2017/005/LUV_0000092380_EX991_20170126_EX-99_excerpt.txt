Gary C. Kelly, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are delighted to report record annual profits for 2016, our 44th consecutive year of profitability. Our total operating revenues reached a record $20.4 billion, with sustained demand for our legendary low fares and superior Customer Service. Our profit margins were very strong, and our ROIC was a near-record 30.0 percent. Our record profits and balance sheet discipline generated record free cash flow, allowing us to return significant value to our Shareholders. Operationally, our performance was also very solid. We carried a record number of Customers while improving our ontime performance, baggage delivery rate, and net 

promoter score. My thanks and congratulations to the superb People of Southwest for these outstanding results, which earned them $586 million in profitsharing during 2016.

"We ended the year with a solid fourth quarter 2016 performance. Total operating revenues grew 2.0 percent, year-over-year, to a fourth quarter record $5.1 billion, exceeding our expectations as of the beginning of the fourth quarter. Travel demand and close-in yields improved post-election. In addition, December business travel was stronger than anticipated leading up to the holiday period. Based on current bookings and revenue trends, we estimate first quarter 2017 operating unit revenues will be flat to down one percent, year-over-year. This represents a continued and sequential improvement from the 2.9 percent operating unit revenue year-over-year decline in fourth quarter 2016, which is an encouraging start to the year.

"As expected, our fourth quarter unit costs increased, year-over-year, due to higher fuel costs, pay increases from amended union contracts, and additional depreciation expense associated with the accelerated retirement of our Boeing 737-300 aircraft. While inflationary cost pressures are expected in 2017 due to the union contract pay increases, we are continuing our efforts to drive offsetting cost efficiencies through fleet modernization and ongoing technology investments in our operations.

"During fourth quarter 2016, we began service to Cuba with daily flights to Varadero, Havana, and Santa Clara. We also launched international flights from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, and Los Cabos, Mexico. In commencing this LAX service, we were the first U.S. carrier to launch new service between the United States and Mexico under the recently approved Air Transport Agreement. Earlier this month, we filed an application with the U.S. Department of Transportation to serve Owen Roberts International Airport in Grand Cayman4, and announced plans to launch service to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in June 2017.

"We are excited about our strategic technology investments, especially our new reservation system. In December, we began selling domestic itineraries in the new Amadeus platform. We remain on track to move to a single reservation system on May 9, 2017, with significant incremental profits expected to begin in 2018. The first release deployed in December, providing booking capabilities for travel on and after May 9, was virtually flawless. As this is the largest technology project in our history, I commend our People on their tremendous efforts to deliver these critical new capabilities. 

“As we close out a year of record results, we begin 2017 with momentum and enthusiasm. We are on track to open a new international terminal in Fort Lauderdale, along with the launch of new service, this June. We are on track to launch the new Boeing 737-8 in the fall. And, we are encouraged by recent revenue trends, as well as the prospects for continued economic growth and moderate fuel prices. We are excited about our current outlook for another strong year with opportunities to win more Customers and reward our People and our Shareholders."

Revenue Results and Outlook

The Company's fourth quarter 2016 total operating revenues were a record $5.1 billion, driven largely by record fourth quarter passenger revenues of $4.6 billion. As compared with fourth quarter 2015, total operating revenues increased 2.0 percent on a 5.0 percent increase in available seat miles, resulting in a 2.9 percent decline in operating unit revenues (RASM). Strong demand for low fares resulted in a fourth quarter record 84.4 percent load factor, and a 3.8 percent year-over-year decline in fourth quarter passenger revenue yield. Based on revenue and booking trends thus far in January, the Company expects its first quarter 2017 RASM to be flat to down one percent, as compared with first quarter 2016.

Annual 2016 total operating revenues increased 3.1 percent, year-over-year, to a record $20.4 billion. Annual operating revenues for 2015 included a one-time special revenue adjustment of $172 million recorded as a result of the July 2015 amendment of the Company’s co-branded credit card agreement with Chase Bank USA, N.A. and a resulting required change in accounting methodology. Excluding this special item, annual 2016 total operating revenues increased 4.0 percent, year-over-year. 

Cost Performance and Outlook

Fourth quarter 2016 total operating expenses increased 7.1 percent to $4.2 billion, and increased 2.0 percent on a unit basis, as compared with fourth quarter 2015. Excluding special items in both periods, which primarily related to the Company's fuel hedge derivative contracts, total operating expenses increased 8.1 percent to $4.3 billion, and increased 2.9 percent on a unit basis, year-over-year. 

Fourth quarter 2016 economic fuel costs1 were $2.07 per gallon, including $.50 per gallon in unfavorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts, compared with $2.03 per gallon in fourth quarter 2015, including $.52 per gallon in unfavorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts. Annual 2016 economic fuel costs per gallon declined 7.2 percent, as compared with 2015. Based on the Company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of January 20, 2017, first quarter economic fuel costs are estimated to be in the $1.95 to $2.00 per gallon range6. As of January 20, 

2017, the fair market value of the Company's fuel derivative contracts settling in first quarter 2017 was a net liability of approximately $136 million, and was a net liability of approximately $354 million for those settling over the remainder of 2017 beyond first quarter. In addition, the fair market value of the hedge portfolio settling in 2018 and 2019, combined, was a net asset of $109 million. Additional information regarding the Company's fuel derivative contracts is included in the accompanying tables.

Excluding fuel and oil expense and special items in both periods, fourth quarter 2016 operating expenses increased 8.8 percent, as compared with fourth quarter 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 profitsharing expense was $123 million, compared with $136 million in fourth quarter 2015. Excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing expense, fourth quarter 2016 operating expenses increased 9.7 percent from fourth quarter 2015, and increased 4.4 percent on a unit basis, both year-over-year, driven largely by additional depreciation expense associated with the accelerated retirement of the Company’s Boeing 737-300 fleet and the impact of amended union contracts in 2016. The Company currently expects its year-over-year unit cost inflation in 2017 to ease substantially by fourth quarter 2017. This is attributed largely to the wage rate increases that became effective in fourth quarter 2016 from the ratification of the Flight Attendant and Pilot contracts, which became amendable June 2013 and September 2012, respectively. Based on current cost trends and the significant snap-up in wage rates in year one of these new agreements, first quarter 2017 unit costs, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing expense, are estimated to increase in the six to seven percent range7, year-over-year, while annual 2017 unit costs, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing expense, are estimated to increase approximately three percent, year-over-year. Wage rate increases from amended union contracts are estimated to drive approximately four points of this first quarter 2017 unit cost outlook, and approximately three points, or substantially all, of this annual 2017 unit cost outlook.

Annual 2016 total operating expenses increased 6.1 percent to $16.7 billion, and increased 0.4 percent on a unit basis, year-over-year. Excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing expense, annual 2016 total operating expenses increased 8.1 percent, and increased 2.3 percent on a unit basis, year-over-year, primarily due to additional depreciation expense associated with the accelerated retirement of the Company’s Boeing 737-300 fleet and the impact of amended union contracts in 2016. 

Fourth Quarter and Annual Results

Fourth quarter 2016 operating income was $846 million, compared with $1.0 billion in fourth quarter 2015. Excluding special items, operating income was $768 million, compared with $992 million in fourth quarter 2015.

Other expenses in fourth quarter 2016 were $37 million, compared with $179 million in fourth quarter 2015. This $142 million decrease resulted primarily from $26 million in other losses recognized in fourth quarter 2016, compared with $164 million in other losses recognized in fourth quarter 2015. In both periods, these losses included ineffectiveness and unrealized mark-to-market amounts associated with a portion of the Company's fuel hedge portfolio, which are special items. Excluding these special items, fourth quarter 2016 had $43 million in other losses, compared with $44 million in fourth quarter 2015, primarily attributable to the premium costs associated with the Company's fuel derivative contracts. First quarter and annual 2017 premium costs related to fuel derivative contracts are currently estimated to be approximately $35 million and $135 million, respectively. Net interest expense in fourth quarter 2016 was $11 million, compared with $15 million in fourth quarter 2015.

Annual 2016 operating income was $3.76 billion, compared with $4.12 billion in 2015. Excluding special items, annual 2016 and 2015 operating income was approximately $3.96 billion in both periods. Annual 2016 net income was a record $2.24 billion, or $3.55 per diluted share, compared with annual 2015 net income of $2.18 billion, or $3.27 per diluted share. Excluding special items, annual 2016 net income was a record $2.37 billion, or $3.75 per diluted share, compared with $2.36 billion, or $3.52 per diluted share in 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Deployment

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $3.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, and a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $1 billion. For 2016, net cash provided by operations was a record $4.29 billion, capital expenditures were $2.04 billion, and assets constructed for others, net of reimbursements, were $2 million, resulting in record free cash flow of $2.25 billion. The Company currently estimates its 2017 capital expenditures will be approximately $2.3 billion. The Company repaid $591 million in debt, convertible notes, and capital lease obligations during 2016, and is currently scheduled to repay approximately $560 million in debt and capital lease 

obligations during 2017. During fourth quarter 2016, the Company issued $300 million of unsecured notes due in 2026, and entered into a $215 million secured term loan maturing in 2026.

In 2016, the Company returned $1.97 billion to its Shareholders through the payment of $222 million in dividends and the repurchase of approximately 40 million shares in common stock for $1.75 billion. This compares with $1.36 billion returned to Shareholders in 2015. During fourth quarter 2016, the Company received the remaining 1.7 million shares pursuant to the $250 million third quarter 2016 accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program, bringing the total shares repurchased under that ASR program to 6.7 million. The Company also received approximately 4.7 million shares pursuant to the $300 million fourth quarter 2016 ASR program representing an estimated 75 percent of the shares expected to be repurchased under that ASR program. The Company has $950 million remaining under its May 2016 $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization.

Fleet and Capacity

The Company ended 2016 with 723 aircraft in its fleet. This reflects the delivery of 38 new Boeing 737-800s and 23 pre-owned Boeing 737-700s, as well as the retirement of 42 Boeing 737-300/500 aircraft during the year. By the end of third quarter 2017, the Company intends to retire the 87 Boeing 737-300s that remained in its fleet at December 31, 2016, as previously announced. After taking into account scheduled deliveries for new and pre-owned aircraft in 2017, this accelerated retirement schedule is expected to decrease the Company's fleet to 703 aircraft by year-end 2017. For 2018, the Company's current firm aircraft commitments would result in 743 aircraft by year-end 2018, including nine Boeing 737-800 options exercised during 2016, and two Boeing 737-800 options exercised in January 2017. The Company increased its available seat miles (capacity) by 5.7 percent in 2016, as compared with 2015, and currently intends to grow its 2017 capacity, year-over-year, by approximately 3.5 percent, with approximately 2.5 points of the increase relating to its domestic growth. Additional information regarding the Company's aircraft delivery schedule is included in the accompanying tables.

6Economic fuel cost projections do not reflect the potential impact of special items because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate the hedge accounting impact associated with the volatility of the energy markets or the impact to its financial statements in future periods. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort.

7Year-over-year projections do not reflect the potential impact of fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items in both years because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate those items or expenses or their impact to its financial statements in future periods, especially considering the significant volatility of the Fuel and oil expense line item. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort.

NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These GAAP financial statements include (i) unrealized non-cash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii) other charges the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operational performance.

As a result, the Company also provides financial information in this release that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial information, including results that it refers to as "economic," which the Company's management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides additional insight to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The non-GAAP measures provided that reflect the Company’s performance on an economic fuel cost basis include Fuel and oil expense, non-GAAP; Total operating expenses, non-GAAP; Operating expenses, non-GAAP, excluding fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP, excluding profitsharing and fuel and oil expense; Operating income, non-GAAP; Operating margin, excluding special items; Other (gains) losses, net, non-GAAP; Net income, non-GAAP; and Net income per share, diluted, non-GAAP. The Company's economic Fuel and oil expense results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts - all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an “economic” basis has historically been utilized by the Company, as well as some of the other airlines that utilize fuel hedging, as it reflects the Company’s actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net, for both GAAP and non-GAAP (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. The Company believes these economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the Company's fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, non-cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Company's management, as well as investors and analysts, to consistently assess the Company's operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations, and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Further information on (i) the Company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

In addition, the Company’s GAAP results in the applicable periods include other charges or benefits that are deemed “special items” that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations and make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or to its competitors’ results. Financial measures identified as non-GAAP (or as excluding special items) have been adjusted to exclude special items. Special items include:

1.A one-time $172 million Special revenue adjustment in July 2015 as a result of the July 2015 amendment of the Company’s co-branded credit card agreement with Chase Bank USA, N.A. and a resulting required change in accounting methodology. This increase to revenue represented a nonrecurring required acceleration of revenues associated with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2009-13;

2.Union contract bonuses recorded for certain workgroups. As the bonuses would only be paid at ratification of the associated tentative agreement and would not represent an ongoing expense to the Company, management believes its results for the associated periods are more usefully compared if the impacts of ratification bonus amounts are excluded from results. Generally, union contract agreements cover a specified three- to five- year period, although such contracts officially never expire, and the agreed upon terms remain in place until a revised agreement is reached, which can be several years following the amendable date;

3.Expenses associated with the Company’s acquisition and integration of AirTran. Such expenses were primarily incurred during the acquisition and integration period of the two companies from 2011 through 2015 as a result of the Company’s acquisition of AirTran, which closed on May 2, 2011. The exclusion of these expenses provides investors with a more applicable basis with which to compare results in future periods now that the integration process has been completed;

4.A gain resulting from a litigation settlement received in January 2015. This cash settlement meaningfully lowered Other operating expenses during the applicable period and the Company does not expect a similar impact on its cost structure in the future;

5.A noncash impairment charge related to leased slots at Newark Liberty International Airport as a result of the FAA announcement in April 2016 that this airport was being changed to a Level 2 schedule-facilitated airport from its previous designation as Level 3; and

6.Lease termination costs recorded during 2016 as a result of the Company acquiring five of its Boeing 737-300 aircraft off operating leases, as part of the Company’s strategic effort to phase out its Classic aircraft from operations by the end of third quarter 2017 in the most economically advantageous manner possible. The Company had not budgeted for these early lease termination costs, as they were subject to negotiations being concluded with the third party lessors. The Company recorded the fair value of the aircraft, as well as any associated remaining obligations to the balance sheet as debt.

Because management believes each of these items can distort the trends associated with the Company’s ongoing performance as an airline, the Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a supplemental presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis for evaluating operating results in future periods. The following measures are often provided, excluding special items, and utilized by the Company’s management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to compare results to other airlines: Operating revenues, non-GAAP; Total operating expenses, non-GAAP; Operating expenses, non-GAAP, excluding fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP, excluding profitsharing and fuel and oil expense; Operating income, non-GAAP; Operating margin, excluding special items; Other (gains) losses, net, non-GAAP; Net income, non-GAAP; Net income per share, diluted, non-GAAP.

The Company has also provided free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes free cash flow is a meaningful measure because it demonstrates the Company's ability to service its debt, pay dividends, and make investments to enhance Shareholder value. Although free cash flow is commonly used as a measure of liquidity, definitions of free cash flow may differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for free cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow, calculated as operating cash flows of $4.3 billion less capital expenditures of $2.0 billion less assets constructed for others of $109 million plus reimbursements for assets constructed for others of $107 million.

The Company has also provided ROIC, which is calculated, in part, using non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how well the Company generates operating income relative to the capital it has invested in its business. Although ROIC is commonly used as a measure of capital efficiency, definitions of ROIC differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for ROIC (before taxes and excluding special items) in the accompanying reconciliation tables (see Return on Invested Capital).
