Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure  

DaVita Inc. (the “Company”) had a lawsuit pending in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the federal government, which was originally filed in May 2011 and previously disclosed by the Company. The lawsuit related to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) underpayment of dialysis services the Company provided from 2005 through 2011 to patients pursuant to VA regulations. The Company and the government amicably reached a resolution of the Company’s claims for $538 million, which will be subject to taxes and consideration of non-controlling interests. This one time settlement is expected to be recognized in the financial statements that will be included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter 2017.  

The information contained in Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section and shall not be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
