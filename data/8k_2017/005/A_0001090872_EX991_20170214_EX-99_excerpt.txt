SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 14, 2017 

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported revenue of $1.07 billion, up 3.8 percent year over year (up 4.8 percent on a core basis(2)) for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2017.

First-quarter GAAP net income was $168 million, or $0.52 per share. Last year’s first-quarter GAAP net income was $121 million, or $0.36 per share. 

During the first quarter, Agilent had intangible amortization of $31 million, acquisition and integration costs of $16 million, transformation costs of $2 million and $2 million of other costs. Excluding these items, a pension settlement gain of $32 million and a tax benefit of $15 million, Agilent reported first-quarter non-GAAP net income of $172 million, or $0.53 per share(1).

“The Agilent team started 2017 with another strong quarter, despite currency headwinds,” said Mike McMullen, Agilent president and CEO. “Our first-quarter revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share(1) exceeded the high end of November’s guidance.

“Our strong revenue results were driven by a return to growth in our Chemical & Energy business and higher-than-expected China growth. Overall, we are confident in the company’s prospects, and we are raising our full-year core revenue growth expectations,” McMullen added.

First-quarter revenue of $540 million from Agilent’s Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (LSAG) grew 3 percent year over year (up 4 percent on a core basis(2)), with strength in pharma, food, chemical and energy. LSAG’s Q1 operating margin for the quarter was 23.4 percent.

First-quarter revenue of $363 million from the Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) grew 6 percent year over year (up 7 percent on a core basis(2)). Both services and consumables experienced healthy growth across all geographies. ACG’s operating margin for the quarter was 20.3 percent.

First-quarter revenue of $164 million from Agilent’s Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) grew 4 percent year over year (also up 4 percent on a core basis(2)), led by strength in Dako-branded products and nucleic acid solutions. DGG’s operating margin for the quarter was 14.3 percent.

(1)Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share primarily excludes the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, transformation initiatives, business exit and divestiture costs, non-cash intangibles amortization, and pension settlement and curtailment gains. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or is not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

(2)Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency, the NMR business and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation between Q1 FY17 GAAP revenue and core revenue is set forth on page 7 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. Core revenue growth as projected for full fiscal year 2017 excludes the impact of currency, the NMR business and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Most of these exclude amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided.

(3)Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q2 FY17 and full fiscal year 2017 excludes primarily the future impact of acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or is not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. Most of these excluded amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $32 million per quarter.

(a) The adjustment for taxes excludes tax benefits that management believes are not directly related to on-going operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. For the three months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19.0% and 20.0%, respectively. 

We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to amortization of intangibles, business exit and divestiture costs, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension curtailment gain and pension settlement gain.

Business exit and divestiture costs include costs associated with the exit of the NMR business and the divestiture of the XRD business. 

Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, small site consolidations, reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. 

Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. 

Pension curtailment gain resulted from certain retirement plans benefit reductions.

Pension settlement gain resulted from transfer of the substitutional portion of our Japanese pension plan to the government.

Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments.

Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.

Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.

Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.

(a) We compare the year-over-year change in revenue excluding the effect of the NMR business, recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency rate fluctuations to assess the performance of our underlying business. To determine the impact of currency fluctuations, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the actual exchange rate in effect during the respective prior periods.

The preliminary reconciliation of GAAP revenue adjusted for the NMR business, recent acquisitions and divestitures and impact of currency is estimated based on our current information.
