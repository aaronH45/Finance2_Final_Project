Ryder Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Results, and Provides 2017 Forecast [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Full-Year GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations Down 14% to $4.94[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

MIAMI, February 2, 2017 – Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a leader in commercial fleet management, dedicated transportation, and supply chain solutions, today reported fourth quarter and full-year earnings and revenue. Results for the three months ended December 31 were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company reported record fourth quarter total revenue and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation). Total revenue increased due to higher operating revenue as well as increased purchased transportation passed through to customers, partially offset by negative impacts from foreign exchange. Operating revenue increased due to higher contractual revenue in all three business segments, partially offset by lower transactional rental revenue and negative impacts from foreign exchange. Total and operating revenue for the three months ended December 31 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commenting on the Company’s results, Ryder Chairman and CEO Robert Sanchez said, “In the fourth quarter, the used vehicle environment proved even more challenging than expected, and we now anticipate these conditions to continue over the next 18 months. As we indicated was a possibility, we increased wholesaling activity during the quarter to reduce our inventory. Additionally, we adjusted used vehicle inventory valuations based on fourth quarter pricing and further declines anticipated in 2017. We also accelerated depreciation to reflect lower pricing on vehicles in operation we expect to make available for sale through June 2018. These valuation and depreciation actions totaled $0.35 in the quarter and better position these vehicles for sale. Commercial rental results were in line with expectations and improved from the first half of the year. This improvement was due to the actions we took earlier in 2016 to quickly align the fleet with reduced market demand. Despite difficult conditions in our transactional businesses, Ryder continued to make progress on our long-term strategy to profitably grow our contractual businesses. Full service lease delivered improved earnings with revenue growth of 5%, and both our dedicated transportation and supply chain businesses showed solid growth in revenue and pre-tax earnings.

"For the full year, GAAP EPS are down 14%, reflecting headwinds in our used vehicle sales and rental businesses that reduced EPS by 33%, or nearly $2.00 per share. Growth in our contractual businesses and cost-savings initiatives offset more than half of this decline. Despite a more challenging truck and freight environment, Ryder's contractual product offerings showed solid revenue increases and continued to benefit from both secular outsourcing trends and our growth initiatives. An increasing percentage of new business is coming from companies that are new to outsourcing, accounting for more than 40% of new lease business and over 50% of new dedicated transportation business. We delivered our fifth consecutive year of lease fleet growth, despite a more difficult business environment, by adding 4,100 more vehicles in 2016, which represents the second highest organic growth in more than a decade. This helped us achieve record highs for the Company in both total revenue and operating revenue for the full-year 2016. We also continued to innovate in order to drive additional long-term growth. We introduced new, more flexible products and configurations, including ChoiceLease and SelectCare, which make it easier for do-it-yourselfers to start doing business with Ryder.

"Finally, our financial position remains solid. We delivered $1.6 billion of operating cash flow and free cash flow of approximately $200 million, enabling us to resume anti-dilutive share repurchases early in the year while continuing to grow our dividend.”

Fourth Quarter Business Segment Operating Results

Fleet Management Solutions

In the Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment, total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.15 billion, consistent with the same period of 2015 (and up 2% excluding foreign exchange), as increased purchased fuel passed through to customers was offset by lower operating revenue. Operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel) was $992 million, down 1% (or up 1% excluding foreign exchange), as lower transactional rental revenue was partially offset by higher contractual revenue. Full service lease revenue increased 5% (or 6% excluding foreign exchange), reflecting a larger average fleet size and higher prices on replacement vehicles. The number of full service lease vehicles (excluding U.K. trailers) increased by 5,300 partly due to a higher number of vehicles being prepared for sale. Adjusting for these units, the lease fleet grew by 4,100 units over the same period, and grew by 400 vehicles sequentially from the third quarter of 2016. Commercial rental revenue decreased 14% due to lower demand. Fuel services revenue increased 5%, reflecting higher fuel prices passed through to customers. 

FMS earnings before tax were $64.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, down 48% compared with $123.5 million in the same period of 2015. Decreased earnings primarily reflect lower used vehicle sales results ($49.7 million), commercial rental performance, and accelerated depreciation ($9.6 million) on vehicles in operation that are expected to be made available for sale through June 2018. These impacts were partially offset by higher full service lease performance and lower overhead spending. Used vehicle sales results decreased due to lower pricing and increased used vehicle inventory valuation reserves. Lower pricing, in part, reflects increased wholesaling to bring used vehicle inventory levels closer to the Company's target range. The valuation and depreciation adjustments reflect current and anticipated market pricing, better positioning the fleet for sale. Commercial rental performance declined reflecting lower demand. Global rental power fleet utilization was 77.3% for the fourth quarter, down 30 basis points. Utilization comparisons were greatly improved from the first half of the year, reflecting fleet right-sizing actions that resulted in a 13% smaller average global rental fleet consistent with the drop in rental demand. Full service lease results benefited from fleet growth. FMS earnings before tax as a percentage of FMS total

Exhibit 99.1

revenue and FMS operating revenue were 5.6% and 6.5%, respectively, down 510 and 590 basis points, driven primarily by lower used vehicle sales results.

Dedicated Transportation Solutions

In the Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS) business segment, fourth quarter 2016 total revenue was up 11% to $257 million and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation), was up 3% to $193.1 million, compared with the year-earlier period. DTS total revenue growth reflected increased purchased transportation passed through to customers and higher operating revenue. DTS operating revenue grew as a result of increased volumes, as well as new business and higher pricing. 

DTS earnings before tax of $15.3 million increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $11.1 million in 2015, due to revenue growth, improved operating performance, and prior-year customer bankruptcy charges of $1.5 million. DTS earnings before tax as a percentage of DTS total revenue and DTS operating revenue were 6.0% and 7.9%, respectively, up 120 and 200 basis points. 

Supply Chain Solutions

In the Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment, fourth quarter 2016 total revenue was up 10% (or 12% excluding foreign exchange) to $430 million and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) was up 9% (or 11% excluding foreign exchange) to $352.7 million, compared with the year-earlier period. SCS total revenue and operating revenue grew as a result of new business and increased volumes.

SCS earnings before tax of $26.4 million increased 11% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $23.8 million in 2015. SCS fourth quarter 2016 earnings results reflect the impact of operating revenue growth. SCS earnings before tax as a percentage of SCS total revenue and SCS operating revenue were 6.1% and 7.5%, respectively, unchanged and up 10 basis points from the prior period.

Corporate Financial Information

Central Support Services

Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Most CSS costs are allocated to the business segments. In the fourth quarter of 2016, unallocated CSS costs were $11 million, compared with $16 million reported in the year-earlier period. Unallocated CSS 

4

Exhibit 99.1

costs decreased due to a $2.8 million prior-year charge related to settlement of a customer-extended insurance claim and lower compensation-related costs in 2016.

Items Excluded from Comparable Earnings 

Comparable fourth quarter 2016 results excluded pre-tax restructuring and other charges of $5.1 million ($3.5 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, related to workforce reductions of approximately 250 employees. The Company expects the workforce reduction and other cost savings initiatives to produce annual savings of $0.32 per diluted share beginning in early 2017. 

Non-operating components of pension costs are excluded from both comparable earnings and segment earnings before tax in order to more accurately reflect the operating performance of the business. Non-operating pension costs totaled $8.0 million ($4.7 million after tax) or $0.09 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016, up from $4.8 million ($2.8 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share in the year-earlier period. This increase was largely due to lower asset returns.

Income Taxes

The Company’s effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 28.8% of pre-tax earnings compared with 32.0% in the year-earlier period. The comparable effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 30.1% of earnings before tax, compared with 32.1% in the year-earlier period. The fourth quarter 2016 effective income tax rate and comparable income tax rate decreased by 460 and 380 basis points, respectively, reflecting lower non-deductible items, as well as the excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation awards. The fourth quarter of 2015 reflects a $2.0 million benefit arising from a favorable Canadian income tax settlement.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures from continuing operations were $1.76 billion for 2016, compared with $2.70 billion in 2015. The decrease in capital expenditures primarily reflects lower planned investments in full service lease and commercial rental. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) from continuing operations were $1.34 billion in 2016, down from $2.27 billion in 2015. Proceeds, primarily from used vehicle sales, of $421 million decreased 1% from $427 million, due to lower vehicle pricing, partially offset by increased volumes.

5

Exhibit 99.1

Cash Flow 

Operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2016 was $1.60 billion, up from $1.44 billion in 2015. Total cash generated from continuing operations (including proceeds from used vehicle sales) in 2016 was $2.10 billion, up $159 million from 2015. Free cash flow from continuing operations in 2016 was positive $194 million, compared with negative $728 million in 2015, reflecting decreased net capital expenditures.

Leverage

Total debt as of December 31, 2016 decreased by $111 million compared with year-end 2015. Debt to equity as of December 31, 2016 was 263% compared with 277% at year-end 2015. Total debt to equity was within Ryder’s long-term target range of 225% to 275%. 

 2017 Earnings Forecast

Commenting on the Company’s outlook, Mr. Sanchez said, “Based on an assumption of continued slow to moderate economic growth, we're forecasting flat to lower earnings per share due to expected challenges in the used vehicle sales environment. We now anticipate that the used vehicle downturn will continue through mid-2018. While future pricing will be determined by the market, our forecast assumes average used vehicle pricing will decline by double digits year-over-year. We have accelerated depreciation on vehicles in operation, which we expect to make available for sale through mid-2018, to reflect this lower outlook.

"Our contractual products across all three business segments are forecasted to continue growing, but at a slower pace than in 2016. We are forecasting lease fleet growth of 3,500 vehicles, as growth from new outsourcing activity more than offset the impact of reduced OEM production. This forecast represents our sixth consecutive year of organic lease fleet growth, as we continue to attract customers that are new to outsourcing.

"Having right-sized our commercial rental fleet earlier in 2016, we expect improved utilization and better rental results for 2017. In addition to earnings growth from our contractual products and improved rental performance, we also anticipate earnings to benefit from workforce reductions taken in late 2016 and other cost-savings actions. 

"We are planning modestly higher capital expenditures this year due to increased investments to refresh our rental fleet. We expect to deliver operating cash flow of $1.7 billion and free cash flow of $250 million, up 

6

Exhibit 99.1

by approximately $85 million and $60 million, respectively, from 2016. The free cash flow is anticipated to reduce our leverage to the middle of our target range, supporting our ability to continue share repurchases under our anti-dilutive program."

Ryder forecasts full-year 2017 GAAP earnings of $4.78 to $5.08 per diluted share, compared with $4.94 per diluted share in 2016. Ryder forecasts full-year 2017 comparable earnings from continuing operations of $5.10 to $5.40 per diluted share, compared with $5.42 per diluted share in 2016. Full-year earnings exclude non-operating pension costs of $0.32 per diluted share in 2017, and exclude non-operating pension, restructuring and other net charges of $0.48 in 2016. Total revenue for the full-year 2017 is forecast to be up 4% to approximately $7 billion. Operating revenue for the full-year 2017 is forecast to be up 3% to approximately $6 billion. Ryder is establishing a first quarter 2017 GAAP earnings forecast of $0.74 to $0.84 per diluted share, compared with $1.05 in the first quarter of 2016. The Company is also establishing a first quarter 2017 comparable earnings forecast of $0.82 to $0.92 per diluted share, compared with $1.12 in the first quarter of 2016. The first quarter presents the most challenging quarter for year-over-year comparisons. The first quarter reflects negative impacts in the used vehicle sales and commercial rental product lines, as well as accelerated depreciation on vehicles in operation, partially offset by earnings growth across Ryder's contractual products and cost savings initiatives. First quarter earnings comparisons exclude pension costs of $0.08 per diluted share in 2017.

Notations

Earnings Before Tax (EBT): Ryder’s primary measurement of business segment financial performance, earnings before tax (EBT), allocates Central Support Services to each business segment and excludes restructuring and other items, as well as non-operating pension costs.

Capital Expenditures: In Ryder’s business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder’s FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in ongoing revenues and cash flows to Ryder, typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company’s fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
