The Company reached a settlement agreement with the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City related to a previously disclosed contractual dispute regarding HCA’s obligation to fund certain capital expenditures in connection with HCA’s purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The settlement agreement enabled the Company to reduce the accrual for this claim by $290 million and resulted in the recognition of legal claim benefits of $279 million and $246 million, respectively, related to this litigation for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.  

Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 3.6 percent to $2.206 billion compared to $2.131 billion in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on Adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA is included in this release.  

Fourth quarter same facility revenue growth of 3.4 percent (reported revenues grew 3.8 percent) was driven by an increase of 1.5 percent in same facility equivalent admissions and an increase of 1.9 percent in same facility revenue per equivalent admission in the fourth quarter of 2016. Same facility admissions increased 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.

2017 Guidance  

Today, HCA issued the following estimated guidance for 2017:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company’s 2017 guidance contains a number of assumptions, including:  

   •   2017 guidance includes full-year earnings for the Company’s Oklahoma facilities which are under agreement to be sold. The Company cannot at this time estimate a closing date.  

   •   2017 guidance excludes the impact of items such as, but not limited to, gains or losses on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs and impairments of long-lived assets.  

   •   2017 guidance for EPS (diluted) includes an estimated $150 million income tax benefit, or $0.40 per diluted share, related to the accounting standard adopted during 2016 which requires the recording of excess tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements as a component of the provision for income taxes. The timing and amounts related to employee equity award settlements are difficult to project and may vary from this estimate.  

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table reconciling net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA is included in this release.  

The Company’s guidance is based on current plans and expectations and is subject to a number of known and unknown uncertainties and risks, including those set forth below in the Company’s “Forward-Looking Statements.”

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs (benefits), and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We believe net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs (benefits), and Adjusted EBITDA are important measures that supplement discussions and analysis of our results of operations. We believe it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our results of operations on the same basis used by management. Management relies upon net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs (benefits), and Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measures to review and assess operating performance of its health care facilities and their management teams.  

Management and investors review both the overall performance (including net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs (benefits), and GAAP net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc.) and operating performance (Adjusted EBITDA) of our health care facilities. Adjusted EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues) are utilized by management and investors to compare our current operating results with the corresponding periods during the previous year and to compare our operating results with other companies in the health care industry. It is reasonable to expect that losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs (benefits) will occur in future periods, but the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our health care facilities and complicate period comparisons of our results of operations and operations comparisons with other health care companies.  

Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs (benefits), and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. as a measure of operating performance or cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Because net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs (benefits), and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs (benefits), and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

2017 Operating Results Forecast  

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company’s forecasted guidance range is based on current plans and expectations and is subject to a number of known and unknown uncertainties and risks.  

 (a) The Company does not forecast the impact of items such as, but not limited to, losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs (benefits) and impairments of long-lived assets because the Company does not believe that it can forecast these items with sufficient accuracy since these items are indeterminable at the time the 2017 forecast is provided.  

 (b) Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that supplements discussions and analysis of our results of operations. We believe it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our results of operations on the same basis used by management. Management relies upon Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess operating performance of its health care facilities and their management teams.  

Management and investors review both the overall performance (including net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc.) and operating performance (Adjusted EBITDA) of our health care facilities. Adjusted EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues) are utilized by management and investors to compare our current operating results with the corresponding periods during the previous year and to compare our operating results with other companies in the health care industry.  

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. as a measure of operating performance or cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
