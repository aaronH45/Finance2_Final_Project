 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

During the period beginning February 1, 2017, and ending February 3, 2017, each of the following executives of Discover Financial Services (the “Company”) adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan (“Plan”) providing for the sale of previously issued shares of common stock of the Company: David W. Nelms, Carlos Minetti, Kathryn McNamara Corley, Roger C. Hochschild and Diane E. Offereins.  

Each Plan was established under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Company’s policies regarding transactions by Company executives in the Company’s securities. Sales of shares under each Plan are executed through a broker and occur on a monthly basis for one year beginning on May 1, 2017, subject to a minimum price threshold. The executive retains no discretion over purchases or sales under the Plan.  

Each executive currently holds shares of common stock of the Company well in excess of the Company’s executive stock ownership guidelines, which require each executive to hold shares equivalent to a certain number of times their base salaries. Assuming all shares under each Plan are sold, each executive’s holdings would continue to remain well in excess of the Company’s executive stock ownership guidelines. The transactions will be disclosed publicly in Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
