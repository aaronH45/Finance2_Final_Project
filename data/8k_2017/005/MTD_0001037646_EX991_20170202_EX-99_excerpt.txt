Fourth Quarter Results

Olivier Filliol, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Sales growth in the quarter was better than expected driven by very good results in Europe and Asia / Rest of the World.

Outlook 

The Company said that based on its assessment of market conditions today, management anticipates local currency sales growth in 2017 will be approximately 5.5%. This sales growth is expected to result in Adjusted EPS in the range of 

-1-

$16.55 to $16.75, an increase of 12% to 13%. Our guidance incorporates the impact of the new accounting regulations related to the tax impact of stock option deductions. 

For the first quarter 2017, local currency sales growth is expected to be approximately 8% and Adjusted EPS in the range of $3.05 to $3.10, an increase of 24% to 26%. 

Adjusted EPS excludes purchased intangible amortization, discrete tax items, restructuring charges and other one-time items. While the Company has provided an outlook for Adjusted EPS, it has not provided an outlook for EPS as it would require an estimate of non-recurring items, which are not yet known. 

Conclusion 

Filliol concluded, "We remain cautious in our outlook on the global economy. While demand in our markets remains solid, we recognize risks exist in many geographic regions. We will monitor closely and adapt our planning as necessary. Assuming our end markets remain stable, we believe the momentum from our initiatives positions us well for sales and earnings growth in 2017 and beyond. Our investments in Field Turbos, Spinnaker sales and marketing programs and new products are yielding tangible results and helping to drive share gains. Equally important, our productivity initiatives provide us with capacity to make further investments for growth."
