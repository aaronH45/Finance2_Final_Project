ALLIANT ENERGY ANNOUNCES 2016 RESULTS AND 2017 EARNINGS GUIDANCE

Updates forecasted 2017-2020 capital expenditures

MADISON, Wis. - February 23, 2017 - Alliant Energy Corporation (NYSE: LNT) today announced U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP consolidated unaudited earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for 2016 and 2015 as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“In 2016, we once again delivered solid financial and operational results,” said Patricia Kampling, Alliant Energy Chairman, President and CEO. “Consistent with our long-term earnings growth goal, our temperature normalized non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 5% over calendar year 2015. We will continue to balance operational and financial discipline, cost impact to customers and capital investments while earning our authorized returns.”

Utilities, ATC and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy’s Utilities, American Transmission Company LLC (ATC) and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $1.85 per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2016, which was $0.19 per share higher than 2015. The primary drivers of higher EPS were higher electric and gas margins, higher allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) related to the Marshalltown Generating Station, and losses on sales of IPL’s Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets in 2015.

Non-regulated and Parent - Alliant Energy’s Non-regulated and Parent operations generated ($0.20) per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2016, which was $0.23 per share lower than 2015. The primary driver of lower EPS was asset valuation charges of $0.23 per share related to the Franklin County wind farm in 2016.

Earnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for 2016 excludes asset valuation charges of $0.23 per share related to the Franklin County wind farm. Non-GAAP EPS for 2015 excludes $0.04 per share of losses on sales of IPL’s Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets and $0.02 per share of voluntary employee separation charges. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.

Temperature impacts to Non-GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations - Temperature did not affect Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for fiscal year 2016. Temperature impacts to 2015 Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations was a $0.04 per share loss, which represents Alliant Energy’s estimate of the negative impact of temperatures on electric and gas margins. The Temperature normalized Non-GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations for fiscal year 2015 is $1.79.

Common Stock Split - In April 2016, Alliant Energy’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one common stock split and a proportionate increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock of Alliant Energy from 240 million shares to 480 million shares to implement the stock split. Alliant Energy shareowners of record at the close of business on May 4, 2016 received one additional share of Alliant Energy common stock for each share held on that date. The proportionate interest that a shareowner owns in Alliant Energy did not change as a result of the stock split. The additional shares were distributed on May 19, 2016 and post-split trading began on May 20, 2016. All share and per share amounts in this release have been reflected on a post-split basis.

Details regarding GAAP EPS from continuing operations variances between 2016 and 2015 for Alliant Energy are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Lower retail electric customer billing credits at IPL - IPL provided customer billing credits to its Iowa retail electric customers of $105 million in aggregate over the 2014-2016 period in connection with its approved Iowa retail electric base rate freeze through 2016. In 2016, IPL credited customer bills by $9 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million.

Losses on sales of Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets in 2015 at IPL - In 2015, IPL completed the sales of its Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets and received aggregate proceeds of approximately $140 million and a $2 million promissory note. The premium received over the book value of the property, plant and equipment sold was more than offset by tax-related regulatory assets associated with the Minnesota distribution assets, resulting in a $0.04 per share non-recurring charge recorded in 2015.

Voluntary employee separation charges - Alliant Energy’s continued focus on cost management for its customers led to voluntary separation offers in 2015 to reshape the organization to be leaner. Approximately 2% of total Alliant Energy employees accepted voluntary separation packages, which resulted in charges of $0.02 per share recorded in 2015.

Asset valuation charges for Franklin County wind farm in 2016 - Based on an evaluation of the strategic options for the Franklin County wind farm performed in 2016, Alliant Energy concluded it was probable the Franklin County wind farm will be transferred to IPL. As a result, an impairment analysis was performed to evaluate the value of the assets and a reasonable estimate of the amount of costs associated with the Franklin County wind farm that would be allowed for recovery for IPL’s electric rate-making purposes. Based on various analyses, including discounted cash flows projected from the Franklin County wind farm, recently executed power purchase agreements associated with wind generating facilities located near the Franklin County wind farm and the cost of new wind farms identified through IPL’s proposed wind expansion, the value of the Franklin County wind farm assets was determined to be approximately $33 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Alliant Energy concluded the value of the Franklin County wind farm assets represents a reasonable estimate of the amount IPL will be allowed for recovery for IPL’s electric rate-making purposes. As a result, the carrying amount of the Franklin County wind farm was reduced to such value resulting in non-cash pre-tax asset valuation charges of $86 million in 2016, or after-tax charges of $51 million, or $0.23 per share.

In November 2016, IPL requested approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to transfer the Franklin County wind farm to IPL and expects to complete such transfer in 2017. The final amount to be recovered for IPL’s electric rate-making purposes is expected to be determined by the Iowa Utilities Board as part of IPL’s 2016 Test Year Iowa retail electric rate case, anticipated to be filed in the second quarter of 2017, and therefore the final asset valuation charge is subject to change.

The transfer of the Franklin County wind farm to IPL is in addition to IPL’s request approved by the Iowa Utilities Board to own and operate up to 500 megawatts of additional wind generation.

2017 Earnings Guidance

Alliant Energy is issuing the following EPS guidance for 2017:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Drivers for Alliant Energy’s 2017 earnings guidance include, but are not limited to:

•Ability of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of return

•Anticipated interim retail electric base rate increase to be implemented by IPL

•Stable economy and resulting implications on utility sales

•Normal temperatures in its utility service territories

•Continuing cost controls and operational efficiencies

•Execution of IPL’s and WPL’s capital expenditure and financing plans

•Consolidated effective tax rate of 18%

The 2017 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, discontinued operations, further impacts from anticipated changes to ATC’s authorized return on equity, future changes in laws or regulations including potential tax reform, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities from valuation allowances and organizational structure changes, pending lawsuits and disputes, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings, or changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy.

“The 6% earnings growth between non-GAAP 2016 and the midpoint of 2017 earnings guidance is consistent with our projected long-term annual earnings growth rate of 5 to 7%,” said Kampling. “The increase in utility investments is a major driver of the earnings growth, and was incorporated in WPL’s approved 2017 retail electric and gas base rates and is forecasted to be in IPL’s estimated interim 2017 retail electric base rates.”

Projected Capital Expenditures

Alliant Energy has updated its projected capital expenditures for 2017 through 2020 primarily to reflect changes in the timing of capital expenditures for renewable projects. The projected capital expenditures exclude AFUDC and capitalized interest, if applicable. Cost estimates represent Alliant Energy’s estimated portion of total escalated construction expenditures.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy’s financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include the use of (1) income from continuing operations and EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 excluding asset valuation charges related to the Franklin County wind farm; and (2) income from continuing operations and EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 excluding losses from the sales of IPL’s Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets and voluntary employee separation charges. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy’s management also uses income from continuing operations, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation.

In addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL; AE Transco Investments, LLC and Corporate Services; utilities, ATC and Corporate Services; and non-regulated and parent EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends and provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.

This press release also includes temperature normalized non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because the measure facilitates period-to-period comparison of Alliant Energy’s operating performance and provides investors with information on a basis consistent with measures that management uses to assess Alliant Energy’s earnings growth rate.

The tax impact adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the estimated consolidated statutory tax rate.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings summaries that follow, and in the case of temperature normalized non-GAAP earnings per share, in the press release above.

Note: Unless otherwise noted, all “per share” references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.
