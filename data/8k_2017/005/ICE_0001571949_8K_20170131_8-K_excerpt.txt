The Bylaws were previously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on December 9, 2016. As the owner of registered national securities exchanges (including the New York Stock Exchange), the Company is required to obtain approval from the Commission for any amendments to its governing documents. The Bylaws are effective as of January 31, 2017, which is the closing date for the acquisition of the National Stock Exchange. 

The Bylaws include changes to Sections 3.15, 8.1 and 11.3 to include NYSE National, Inc. and remove NYSE Market (DE), Inc. and NYSE Regulation, Inc. from the list of specified subsidiaries of the Company in the applicable provisions. The Bylaws also include new Sections 12.1 and 12.2 that specify the voting and ownership limitations placed on the Company in connection with its ownership of NYSE National, Inc. 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
