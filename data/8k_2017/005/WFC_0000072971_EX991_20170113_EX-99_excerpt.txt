Selected Financial Information

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity investments but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the "Tangible Common Equity" tables on page 35.

(b)The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).

Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported diluted earnings per common share of $3.99 for 2016, compared with $4.12 for 2015. Full year net income in 2016 was $21.9 billion, compared with $22.9 billion in 2015. For fourth quarter 2016, net income was $5.3 billion, or $0.96 per share, compared with $5.6 billion, or $1.00 per share, for fourth quarter 2015, and $5.6 billion, or $1.03 per share, for third quarter 2016.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said, "We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders. I am pleased with the progress we have made in customer remediation, the ongoing review of sales practices across the company and fulfilling our regulatory requirements for sales practices matters. As planned, we launched our new Retail Bank compensation program this month, which is based on building lifelong relationships with our customers. While we have more work to do, I am proud of the effort of our entire team to make things right for our customers and team members and to continue building a better Wells Fargo for the future.”

Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said, “Wells Fargo had solid underlying performance in the fourth quarter as we continued to benefit from our diversified business model. Net interest income increased from the prior quarter, largely driven by growth in loans and investments, as well as higher interest rates. Noninterest income declined from the prior quarter due to net hedge accounting ineffectiveness associated with our hedging of long-term debt as part of our asset/liability management program, as well as lower market-sensitive revenue. Other sources of noninterest income were diversified and stable with the prior quarter. Credit quality remained solid in the quarter, and we returned $3.0 billion to shareholders in the quarter, with a full year 2016 net payout ratio2 of 61 percent."

2 Net payout ratio means the ratio of (i) common stock dividends and share repurchases less issuances and stock compensation-related items, divided by (ii) net income applicable to common stock.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income in fourth quarter 2016 increased $450 million from third quarter 2016 to $12.4 billion, primarily due to growth in loans and investment securities, higher interest income on trading assets, higher variable income including periodic dividends and fees, and a modest benefit from higher interest rates in the quarter. 

Net interest margin was 2.87 percent, up 5 basis points from third quarter 2016, driven by growth in loans, investment securities and trading assets, and the impact from higher interest rates. Income from variable sources contributed approximately two basis points in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by growth in funding balances, primarily long-term debt and deposits.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $9.2 billion, compared with $10.4 billion in third quarter 2016. Fee income in many of the businesses in the quarter was stable compared with the prior quarter; however, linked-quarter results included a $592 million loss due to the impact of higher interest rates and currency movements on hedging results (net hedge ineffectiveness accounting loss) reflected in Other income. The linked-quarter decline also reflected decreases in trading income and mortgage banking fees, partially offset by higher equity gains and stronger investment banking fees.

Net loss from trading activities was $109 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a net gain of $415 million in the third quarter. Of the total linked-quarter decline of $524 million, $223 million resulted from a decrease in secondary trading, reflecting lower client volumes compared with a strong third quarter, as well as seasonality and fewer trading days in the quarter. Market-driven changes in credit spreads and higher swap rates resulted in a $61 million decline from credit valuation adjustments (CVA) in the quarter. Additionally, $204 million of the decline was associated with items that were offset in other areas, and were therefore neutral to net income:

•$98 million of losses resulted from certain hedged trading positions in our equity and residential mortgage-backed security books in which dividend and interest payments were recognized in net interest income and corresponding declines in the value of associated hedges were reflected in trading losses.

•Deferred compensation trading gains, which were largely offset in employee benefits expense, declined $106 million from the third quarter.

Mortgage banking noninterest income was $1.4 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in third quarter 2016. Residential mortgage loan originations were $72 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $70 billion in the third quarter. The production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage loan originations3 was 1.68 percent, down from 1.81 percent in the third quarter. Mortgage servicing income declined to $196 million in the fourth quarter from $359 million in the third quarter, primarily due to higher unreimbursed servicing costs.

Other income was $(382) million, compared with $315 million in third quarter, and included $592 million in hedge ineffectiveness losses, net of related economic hedges, resulting from certain key interest rate and foreign currency

fluctuations. Full year 2016 net hedge ineffectiveness losses were $15 million, as prior quarters included net gains. Substantially all of the ineffectiveness related to hedges of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar long-term debt. 

Background on Hedge Ineffectiveness

As part of Wells Fargo's ongoing funding strategy, the Company is a regular issuer of long-term debt, which typically is fixed rate in order to meet the demands of debt investors. As part of the Company’s asset/liability management program, however, this fixed rate is typically swapped to floating rate in order to balance the Company's deposit-oriented liability structure to better align with the interest rate sensitivity characteristics of the Company's assets. While the majority of long-term debt is issued in U.S. dollars, non-U.S. dollar issuances are also used to diversify funding sources. Any non-U.S. dollar issuance is either swapped to U.S. dollars or is identified to be directly funding non-U.S. dollar assets. While the Company believes this hedging strategy is prudent from an asset/liability management perspective, it is generally not possible to achieve a perfect accounting hedge due to differences in the required valuation measurement of the hedging instrument, such as an interest rate swap, and the hedged risk component of the Company's long-term debt.

From an accounting standpoint, the measurement of the “effectiveness” of the hedge occurs throughout the quarter up to and including the last day of the quarter and results, therefore, can be affected by that point-in time calculation. While the hedge ineffectiveness recognized over the life of hedging relationships is expected to be zero as long as hedge accounting is maintained and the hedges are held to maturity, periodic ineffectiveness is recognized in other noninterest income as interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations occur. In first quarter 2016, for example, a sharp decline in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations drove a net hedge accounting gain of $379 million in the Company’s other noninterest income. Conversely, the net hedge accounting losses in fourth quarter 2016 were driven by a sharp increase in certain interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. Reported results in any quarter can also be affected by a related but separate economic hedging strategy the Company employs, also utilizing interest rate swaps, to partially offset the periodic volatility caused by the required effectiveness measurement.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an exposure draft on hedge accounting guidelines and is expected to issue new guidance in 2017. If issued in its current form, the interest rate-related ineffectiveness associated with the Company's long-term debt hedges would be significantly reduced.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter declined $53 million from the prior quarter to $13.2 billion, primarily due to lower operating losses, charitable donations, which were elevated in the third quarter due to a $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation, and deferred compensation expense (included in employee benefits expense and largely offset in revenue). Fourth quarter expenses included typically higher outside professional services, equipment, and advertising. Fourth quarter foreclosed asset expense increased from the third quarter which included an elevated level of commercial real estate recoveries. The efficiency ratio increased to 61.2 percent in fourth quarter 2016, compared with 59.4 percent in the prior quarter, primarily due to the impact of hedge ineffectiveness losses on revenue. The efficiency ratio for full year 2016 was 59.3 percent. The Company expects the efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level.

Loans

Total loans were $967.6 billion at December 31, 2016, up $6.3 billion from September 30, 2016. Loan growth in the quarter was affected by the deconsolidation of certain previously sold reverse mortgage loans, which resulted from the sale of the related servicing, and reduced real estate 1-4 family first mortgages by $3.8 billion (offset in long-term debt). Commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, credit card and lease financing all grew in the quarter, while real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage and automobile declined. Total average loans were $964.1 billion in the fourth quarter, up $6.7 billion from the prior quarter.

Period-End Loan Balances

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investment Securities

Investment securities were $407.9 billion at December 31, 2016, up $17.1 billion from third quarter, as approximately $44 billion of purchases, predominantly federal agency mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, were partially offset by run-off.

Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities were $1.8 billion at December 31, 2016, compared with net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities of $4.5 billion at September 30, 2016, as the impact from higher interest rates was partially offset by tighter credit spreads. 

Deposits

Total average deposits for fourth quarter 2016 were $1.3 trillion, up 2 percent from the prior quarter, driven by both commercial and consumer growth. The average deposit cost for fourth quarter 2016 was 12 basis points, up 1 basis point from the prior quarter.

Capital

Capital levels remained strong in the fourth quarter, with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (fully phased-in) of 10.7 percent1. While flat from the prior quarter, Common Equity Tier 1 experienced a decline due to changes in unrealized gains/losses recognized in Other comprehensive income (OCI) resulting from higher interest rates experienced in the fourth quarter, which were largely offset by a decline in standardized risk-weighted assets, primarily due to a decrease in the Company's exposure to counterparty risk. In fourth quarter 2016, the Company repurchased 24.9 million shares of its common stock and entered into a $750 million forward repurchase transaction, which settled on January 12, 2017, for 14.7 million shares. The Company paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.38 per share, up from $0.375 per share a year ago.

Credit Quality

“Credit results were stable in the fourth quarter and overall credit quality continued to be driven by strong performance in the commercial and consumer real estate portfolios," said Chief Risk Officer Mike Loughlin. "Continued improvement in residential real estate and stabilization in oil and gas industry conditions drove a $100 million reserve release4 in the fourth quarter."

Net Loan Charge-offs

The quarterly loss rate of 0.37 percent (annualized) reflected commercial losses of 0.20 percent and consumer losses of 0.56 percent. Credit losses were $905 million in fourth quarter 2016, up $100 million, from third quarter 2016. Consumer losses increased $64 million, driven by losses in the credit card, automobile and other revolving credit and installment portfolios. Commercial losses were up $36 million, driven by $32 million in lower recoveries. 

Net Loan Charge-Offs

(a)Quarterly net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans are annualized. See explanation on page 31 of the accounting for purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans and the impact on selected financial ratios.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets decreased $644 million from third quarter 2016 to $11.4 billion. Nonaccrual loans decreased $602 million from third quarter to $10.4 billion reflecting lower consumer real estate, commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate nonaccruals.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12.5 billion at December 31, 2016, which was down $154 million from September 30, 2016. The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.30 percent, compared with 1.32 percent in third quarter 2016. The allowance covered 3.5 times annualized fourth quarter net charge-offs, compared with 4.0 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage for nonaccrual loans was 121 percent at December 31, 2016, compared with 116 percent at September 30, 2016. “We believe the allowance was appropriate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2016,” said Loughlin.

Business Segment Performance

Wells Fargo defines its operating segments by product type and customer segment. Effective fourth quarter 2016, we realigned some personnel and business activities from Wholesale Banking to Community Banking, as a result of the formation of the new Payments, Virtual Solutions, and Innovation Group. Results for these operating segments reflect the shift prospectively from November 1, 2016. Segment net income for each of the three business segments was:

Selected Financial Information

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Community Banking reported net income of $2.7 billion, down $494 million, or 15 percent, from third quarter 2016. Revenue of $11.7 billion decreased $726 million, or 6 percent, from third quarter 2016 due to lower other income (hedge ineffectiveness), mortgage banking revenue, and deposit service charges, partially offset by higher net interest income, market sensitive revenue, primarily higher gains on sales of debt securities and equity investments, and other fees. Noninterest expense increased $32 million, compared with third quarter 2016, due to higher equipment, project-related, and advertising expense, which are typically elevated in the fourth quarter, as well as higher legal expense. The increase in noninterest expense was partially offset by lower operating losses and a donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation in the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses decreased $20 million from the prior quarter.

Net income was down $436 million, or 14 percent, from fourth quarter 2015. Revenue decreased $669 million, or 5 percent, compared with a year ago due to lower other income (hedge ineffectiveness), mortgage banking revenue, and gains on equity investments, partially offset by higher net interest income and other fees. Noninterest expense increased $92 million, or 1 percent, from a year ago driven by higher personnel, legal, project-related, and FDIC expense, partially offset by lower operating losses. The provision for credit losses decreased $73 million from a year ago due to improvement in the consumer real estate portfolios.

Retail Banking and Consumer Payments

•We recently launched a new compensation plan in our Retail Bank focused on customer service, growth in primary customers, household relationship growth and risk management. These measures are consistent with other success metrics we have introduced in the recent past and, as part of this evolution, the cross-sell metric will not be included going forward.

•Branch customer experience survey scores continued to improve throughout the fourth quarter, with many metrics reaching close to pre-settlement ranges by the end of December; loyalty, which has also shown a strong improvement trajectory, will require a longer period to recover previous highs.

•Primary consumer checking customers5 up 3.5 percent year-over-year6

•Primary consumer checking customers5 in December up 3.0 percent year-over-year

Selected Financial Information

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Wholesale Banking reported net income of $2.2 billion, up $147 million, or 7 percent, from third quarter 2016. Revenue of $7.2 billion increased $6 million as higher net interest income, investment banking fees, equity investment gains and commercial real estate brokerage fees were partially offset by lower sales and trading results, and lower mortgage banking fees in multi-family capital and structured real estate. Noninterest expense decreased $118 million, or 3 percent, from the prior quarter primarily due to lower personnel expense and operating losses. The provision for credit losses increased $11 million from the prior quarter on lower recoveries.

Net income was up $90 million, or 4 percent, from fourth quarter 2015. Revenue increased $594 million, or 9 percent, from fourth quarter 2015, on increased net interest income driven by strong loan growth, including the 

7 Combined consumer and business debit card purchase volume dollars.

8 Credit card penetration defined as the percentage of Retail Banking households that have a credit card with Wells Fargo. Effective second

quarter 2016, Retail Banking households reflect only those households that maintain a retail checking account, which we believe provides the

foundation for long-term retail banking relationships. Prior period metrics have been revised to conform with the updated definition of Retail Banking households. Credit card household penetration rates have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of the approximately 565,000 potentially unauthorized accounts identified by an independent consulting firm because the maximum impact in any one quarter was not greater than 86 basis points, or approximately 2 percent.

9 Primarily includes retail banking, consumer lending, small business and business banking customers.

GE Capital portfolio acquisitions, and higher trading and other earning assets. Noninterest income was down 1 percent from the prior year due to lower insurance fees driven by the sale of our crop insurance business in first quarter 2016, lower gains from trading activities, and lower gains on debt securities, partially offset by higher leasing income related to the GE Capital portfolio acquisitions and strong investment banking fees. Noninterest expense increased $511 million, or 15 percent, from a year ago primarily due to the GE Capital portfolio acquisitions and higher expenses related to growth initiatives, compliance, and regulatory requirements. The provision for credit losses increased $42 million from a year ago primarily due to higher oil and gas net charge-offs.

•Average loans increased 11 percent from fourth quarter 2015, on broad-based growth, including asset-backed finance, commercial real estate, corporate banking, equipment finance, government and institutional banking, international, and structured real estate as well as the GE Capital portfolio acquisitions

Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries

SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity investments but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the "Tangible Common Equity" tables on page 35.

(2)The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).

(3)Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.

(4)Consumer and small business banking deposits are total deposits excluding mortgage escrow and wholesale deposits.

(5)Book value per common share is common stockholders' equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding.

CHANGES IN ACCRETABLE YIELD RELATED TO PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS

Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired. PCI loans predominantly represent loans acquired from Wachovia that were deemed to be credit impaired. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, recent borrower credit scores and recent LTV percentages. PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the associated allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date.

As a result of PCI loan accounting, certain credit-related ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.

The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated lives of the PCI loans using the effective yield method. The accretable yield is affected by:

•Changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans - Expected future cash flows are based on the variable rates in effect at the time of the quarterly assessment of expected cash flows;

•Changes in prepayment assumptions - Prepayments affect the estimated life of PCI loans which may change the amount of interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be collected; and

•Changes in the expected principal and interest payments over the estimated life - Updates to changes in expected cash flows are driven by the credit outlook and actions taken with borrowers. Changes in expected future cash flows from loan modifications are included in the regular evaluations of cash flows expected to be collected.

The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans since the merger with Wachovia is presented in the following table.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes accretable yield released as a result of settlements with borrowers, which is included in interest income.

(2)Includes accretable yield released as a result of sales to third parties, which is included in noninterest income.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(4)Represents changes in cash flows expected to be collected due to the impact of modifications, changes in prepayment assumptions, changes in interest rates on variable rate PCI loans and sales to third parties.

PICK-A-PAY PORTFOLIO (1)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The individual states shown in this table represent the top five states based on the total net carrying value of the Pick-a-Pay loans at the beginning of 2016.

(2)Adjusted unpaid principal balance includes write-downs taken on loans where severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower financial stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan.

(3)The current LTV ratio is calculated as the adjusted unpaid principal balance divided by the collateral value. Collateral values are generally determined using automated valuation models (AVM) and are updated quarterly. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate market values of homes based on processing large volumes of market data including market comparables and price trends for local market areas.

(4)Carrying value, which does not reflect the allowance for loan losses, includes remaining purchase accounting adjustments, which, for PCI loans may include the nonaccretable difference and the accretable yield and, for all other loans, an adjustment to mark the loans to a market yield at date of merger less any subsequent charge-offs.

(5)The ratio of carrying value to current value is calculated as the carrying value divided by the collateral value.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (1)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity investments but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity.

(2)Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity investments, which are included in other assets.

(3)Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end.

COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 UNDER BASEL III (FULLY PHASED-IN) (1) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Basel III capital rules, adopted by the Federal Reserve Board on July 2, 2013, revised the definition of capital, increased minimum capital ratios, and introduced a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. These rules established a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that implements the Basel III capital framework and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules are being phased in through the end of 2021. Fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules. Fully phased-in regulatory capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are considered non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management, bank regulatory agencies, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Company’s capital position.

(2)Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity investments, which are included in other assets.

(3)Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end.

(4)The final Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks: the Standardized Approach, which replaced Basel I, and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions. Under the final rules, we are subject to the lower of our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy. Because the final determination of our CET1 ratio and which approach will produce the lower CET1 ratio as of December 31, 2016, is subject to detailed analysis of considerable data, our CET1 ratio at that date has been estimated using the Basel III definition of capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. The capital ratio for September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, was calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs.

(5)The Company’s December 31, 2016, RWAs and capital ratio are preliminary estimates.

(1)The management accounting process measures the performance of the operating segments based on our management structure and is not necessarily comparable with other similar information for other financial services companies. We define our operating segments by product type and customer segment. Effective fourth quarter 2016, we realigned some personnel and business activities from Wholesale Banking to Community Banking, as a result of the formation of the new Payments, Virtual Solutions, and Innovation Group. Results for these operating segments reflect the shift prospectively from November 1, 2016.

(2)Includes the elimination of certain items that are included in more than one business segment, substantially all of which represents products and services for Wealth and Investment Management customers served through Community Banking distribution channels.

(3)Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of liabilities to fund those assets. Interest earned includes actual interest earned on segment assets and, if the segment has excess liabilities, interest credits for providing funding to other segments. The cost of liabilities includes interest expense on segment liabilities and, if the segment does not have enough liabilities to fund its assets, a funding charge based on the cost of excess liabilities from another segment.
