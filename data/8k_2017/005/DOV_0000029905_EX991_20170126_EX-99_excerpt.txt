Downers Grove, Illinois, January 26, 2017 — Dover (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year. The increase in the quarter was driven by acquisition growth of 11%, offset by an organic revenue decline of 2%, a 3% impact from dispositions, and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 1%. Earnings from continuing operations were $161.2 million, an increase of 18% as compared to $136.6 million for the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations ("EPS") for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, were $1.03, compared to $0.87 EPS in the prior year period, representing an increase of 18%. EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 included a gain on a disposition of $0.36, a charge of $0.09 for a voluntary product recall, and $0.05 of discrete tax benefits. EPS from continuing operations for the prior year period include discrete tax benefits of $0.06 EPS. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.71, a decrease of 12% from an adjusted EPS of $0.81 in the prior year period. EPS for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 include restructuring costs of $0.04 EPS and $0.08 EPS, respectively.

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $6.8 billion, a decrease of 2% from the prior year, reflecting an organic revenue decline of 5%, a 3% impact from dispositions, and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 1%, offset by acquisition growth of 7%. Earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, were $508.9 million, a decrease of 15% as compared to $595.9 million for the prior year period. Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $3.25, compared to $3.74 EPS in the prior year period, representing a decrease of 13%. EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, includes gains on dispositions of $0.44, a charge of $0.09 for a voluntary product recall, and discrete tax benefits of $0.09. EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, includes discrete tax benefits of $0.11. Excluding these items adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased 22% to $2.82 from a comparable EPS of $3.63 in the prior year period. EPS 

for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 also include restructuring costs of $0.18 EPS and $0.25 EPS, respectively.

Dover’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, “I was pleased with our fourth quarter business activity and results. And, I was especially pleased we were able to close the Wayne transaction earlier than previously expected.

“Among the highlights in the quarter were a continued recovery in our shorter cycle drilling and artificial lift markets, along with strong results in our Printing & Identification platform. We also saw solid activity in our Bearings & Compression and Petrochemical & Polymer markets. These positive developments helped mitigate continued soft conditions in longer cycle oil & gas markets, especially within transport, and challenges in retail refrigeration.

“With regard to 2017, we confirm our guidance for full year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60. Within this guidance, revenue growth is expected to be 10% to 12%, including organic growth of 3% to 5% and acquisition growth of approximately 10%, partially offset by a 1% impact from dispositions and a 2% headwind from FX.”

Net earnings for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, were $161.2 million, or $1.03 EPS, compared to net earnings of $141.8 million, or $0.91 EPS, for the same period of 2015, which included earnings from discontinued operations of $5.3 million. 

Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016, were $508.9 million, or $3.25 EPS, compared to net earnings of $869.8 million, or $5.46 EPS, for the same period of 2015, which included earnings from discontinued operations of $273.9 million, or $1.72 EPS. 2015 earnings from discontinued operations included gains of $265.6 million, or $1.67 EPS, resulting from the disposition of two businesses.

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2016

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Acquisitions

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company completed the acquisitions of Ravaglioli S.p.A. Group, a provider of automotive service equipment, and Wayne Fueling Systems Ltd., a provider of fuel dispensing, payment, systems and aftermarket services for retail and commercial fuel stations. These acquisitions were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Engineered Systems and Fluids segments, respectively. For the full year 2016, Dover made a total of six acquisitions for a net cash consideration totaling $1,561.7 million. 

Disposed Businesses

For the full year 2016, the Company completed the sale of Texas Hydraulics, a custom manufacturer of fluid power components, during the first quarter of 2016 as well as Tipper Tie, a global supplier of processing and clip packaging machines, during the fourth quarter of 2016. These disposals did not represent strategic shifts in operations and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. Upon disposal of these businesses, the Company recognized total proceeds of $47.3 million and $158.9 million, which resulted in an after-tax gain on sale of $11.2 million and $57.0 million, respectively.

Restructuring

During the quarter, the Company took actions to adjust our costs and streamline our businesses, resulting in $8.8 million, or $0.04 EPS, of restructuring charges. These charges were incurred primarily within our Fluids segment with costs incurred of $7.8 million. For full year, restructuring costs totaled $40.2 million, or $0.18 EPS, of which primarily $18.5 million was incurred in Energy and $16.9 million in Fluids. 

Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 25.4% and 19.4% for the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. On a full year basis, the effective tax rates on continuing operations for 2016 and 2015 were 26.2% and 25.6%, respectively. The 2016 and 2015 rates were favorably impacted by discrete and other items, as shown in the reconciliation for quarterly earnings per share included herein. After adjusting for discrete and other items, the fourth quarter effective tax rates were 29.0% and 25.0% for 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the full year rates were 28.1% and 27.8% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate year over year is principally due to adjustments of the tax accounts to the U.S. tax return filed.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, Management also discloses non-GAAP information that Management believes provides useful information to investors. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations, adjusted diluted earnings per common share, net debt, net capitalization, net debt to net capitalization ratio, free cash flow, organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for earnings from continuing operations, diluted earnings per common share, debt or equity, cash flows from operating activities, or revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations represents earnings from continuing operations adjusted for gains or losses from discrete and other tax items, gain on disposition of businesses, and a product recall charge. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share represents adjusted earnings from continuing operations divided by average diluted shares. Management believes this information is useful to investors to better understand the company’s ongoing profitability and facilitates easier comparisons of the company’s profitability to prior and future periods and to its peers. Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. Management believes the net debt to net capitalization ratio is useful to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.
