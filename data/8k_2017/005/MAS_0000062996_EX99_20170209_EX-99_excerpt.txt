2016 Fourth Quarter Operating Segment Highlights

•Decorative Architectural Products’ net sales increased 5 percent with strong volume growth partially offset by promotional activity

•Windows and Other Specialty Products’ net sales decreased 2 percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 2 percent, led by both our international and North American windows businesses

“We finished the year with good fourth quarter results,” said Keith Allman, Masco’s President and CEO. “Our Plumbing Products segment had another record quarter on both the top and bottom lines, demonstrating the strength of our brands and our innovative products. Our Decorative Architectural Products segment posted solid 5 percent growth in the quarter, and we executed our planned investment to drive future profitable growth. Our Cabinetry Products segment continued its strategy of exiting certain direct-to-builder business, introducing new products, and driving growth with our market-leading Merillat® and KraftMaid® brands. We began to see improvements in the operations of our U.S. window business, and we continued our disciplined capital allocation by returning approximately $240 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter.”
