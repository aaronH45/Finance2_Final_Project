        "Mead Johnson Nutrition Company Financial Information (UNAUDITED) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Results This news release contains non-GAAP financial measures, each of which is listed in the tables below. The items included in GAAP measures, but excluded for the purpose of determining the non-GAAP financial measure, include significant income/expenses not indicative of underlying operating results, including the related tax effect and, at times, the impact of foreign exchange. The non-GAAP measures represent an indication of the company’s underlying operating results and are intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the company’s financial performance and ability to compare the company’s performance to that of its peer companies. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that reconcile non-GAAP to GAAP disclosure follow below. Non-GAAP EBITDA Year Ended December 31, 2016 EBIT $ 818.7 Pension Remeasurement (a) (7.4 ) Fuel for Growth (b) 29.2 Venezuela (c) 81.8 All Other (d) 4.5 Depreciation and Amortization 99.6 Non-GAAP EBITDA 1,026.4 Consolidated Net Debt December 31, 2016 Short-term borrowings $ 3.9 Long-Term Debt 2,976.2 Total Debt 2,980.1 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 1,795.4 Ned debt $ 1,184.7 (a) Pension Remeasurement: When incurred, gains and losses related to the remeasurement of defined benefit pension and post-employment benefit plans are classified as Specified Items and excluded from non-GAAP performance measures. Pension remeasurement reflects changes in the pension assets and liabilities above what was estimated and included in periodic costs. Factors beyond our control such as changes in discount rates, market volatility and mortality assumptions drive the remeasurement amount. The majority of our pension and post-employment plans are frozen, and therefore the benefit provided to such employees is not related to our underlying operations. (b) Fuel for Growth: The Company approved a plan to implement a business productivity program referred to as “Fuel for Growth,” during the third quarter of 2015, which is anticipated to be implemented over a three-year period. Fuel for Growth is designed to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs. Fuel for Growth is expected to improve profitability and create additional investments behind brand building and growth initiatives. Fuel for Growth focuses on the optimization of resources within various operating functions and certain third party costs across the business. (c) Venezuela: Foreign exchange losses, long-lived asset impairments and other asset write-offs in Venezuela. (d) All Other: Primarily includes restructuring costs in 2016. Page 4"
