On January 5, 2017, Mr. Crusa notified the Company that his retirement date from the Company is expected to be December 31, 2017. As part of Mr. Crusa’s retirement transition, he will continue to receive his current annual base salary of $380,000 until April 2, 2017 when such rate will be reduced to $190,000. His salary rate is expected to be further reduced to $152,000 on July 9, 2017.

At Mr. Crusa’s request, he will not receive a 2017 grant of either Performance Stock Units or Growth Performance Stock Units under the Company’s Profitable Growth Incentive Program.
