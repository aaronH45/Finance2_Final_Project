CHICAGO, January 25, 2017 - Grainger (NYSE: GWW) today reported results for the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales of $10.1 billion were up 2 percent versus $10 billion in 2015. Reported net earnings of $606 million declined 21 percent versus $769 million in 2015. Reported earnings per share of $9.87 were down 15 percent versus $11.58 in 2015. 

“In 2016 we faced a challenging demand environment compounded by a lack of inflation, which put pressure on revenue and gross margins. In the face of this pressure, we effectively managed expenses while making moves to improve our long-term competitiveness,” said DG Macpherson, Chief Executive Officer. “Our core businesses performed in line with guidance, and we continue to be pleased with our progress on key initiatives including sales force effectiveness and the vertical alignment of the sales force in the United States, the medium-sized customer acquisition and penetration strategy in the United States and the growth of the online model globally. In 2017, we remain focused on creating value for customers, delivering an effortless customer experience and reducing costs.

“The fourth quarter and the year contained adjustments from our previously announced restructuring plans as well as several accounting actions that affected our reported results. The largest of these was a goodwill impairment for Fabory. Since we acquired Fabory, the business has struggled with growth and profitability. During the last few years, we’ve returned the business to solid footing by reducing the cost base and stabilizing revenue. Unfortunately, this progress is not enough to justify the current valuation. As a result, we’ve recognized an

impairment charge on the business. We still believe Fabory can deliver profitable growth for Grainger going forward,” he concluded.

The years 2016 and 2015 contained the following items that the company believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and have been adjusted out to provide better comparability with prior periods. Excluding these items in the tables below, net earnings decreased 10 percent and earnings per share decreased 3 percent. Details regarding these adjustments are provided in the analysis of the fourth quarter.

The company reiterated its 2017 sales and earnings per share guidance issued on November 11, 2016, and continues to expect 2 to 6 percent sales growth and earnings per share of $11.30 to $12.40 for 2017. Further information on 2017 guidance assumptions can be found in the earnings release supplement available on the company’s website. 

For the full year, the company generated $1.0 billion in operating cash flow versus $990 million in 2015. Gross capital expenditures for the year were $284 million versus $374 million in 2015. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $774 million versus $631 million in 2015, up 23 percent. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations minus net capital expenditures. Grainger repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares of stock for $790 million in 2016 as part of the expanded share buyback program announced in April 2015. Dividends paid in 2016 totaled $303 million. For the year, Grainger returned $1.1 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.

The company also had a $4 million, or $0.06 per share, charge from discrete tax items. In total there were $1.44 per share of charges in the 2016 quarter versus $0.19 per share in the 2015 quarter. 

Company 

Company sales in the 2016 fourth quarter were flat versus the prior year. There were 63 selling days in the 2016 fourth quarter, one fewer than in the 2015 quarter. On a daily basis, total company sales were up 1 percent for the quarter. The 1 percent daily sales increase consisted of a 1 percentage point increase from volume and a 1 percentage point increase from the timing of the holidays in December, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price.

Company operating earnings of $174 million for the 2016 fourth quarter declined 31 percent versus the 2015 quarter. This decrease was driven by the flat sales, restructuring costs, other charges and a lower gross profit margin. The company’s gross profit margin for the quarter declined 0.4 percentage point, primarily driven by price deflation exceeding cost deflation and unfavorable customer mix. Operating expenses increased 9 percent. Excluding the items noted above in the fourth quarter table, adjusted operating expenses were down 1 percent and adjusted operating earnings in the quarter were down 3 percent. 

The company has two reportable business segments, the United States and Canada, which represented approximately 80 percent of company sales for the quarter. The remaining operating businesses are located in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The single channel online businesses are included in Other Businesses and are not reportable segments. 

United States

Sales in the United States segment declined 1 percent in the 2016 fourth quarter versus the prior year and were flat on a daily basis. The daily sales performance was composed of a 1 percentage point increase from higher intercompany sales to Zoro and 1 percentage point from the timing of the holidays, offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price and a 1 percentage point decline from volume. Government, Retail and Light Manufacturing customers had the strongest sales performance in the quarter. 

Operating earnings for the United States segment declined 11 percent in the quarter driven by the restructuring costs, other charges, lower sales and lower gross profit margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter decreased 0.3 percentage point driven by price deflation exceeding cost

deflation and better relative growth with lower margin customers. Operating expenses increased 3 percent due to the restructuring costs and charges. Excluding the items noted above, adjusted operating expenses were down 1 percent and adjusted operating earnings for the U.S. segment in the quarter were down 3 percent versus the prior year.

Canada

Sales in the 2016 fourth quarter at Acklands-Grainger declined 11 percent in U.S. dollars. On a daily basis, sales declined 9 percent in U.S. and local currency. The 9 percent daily sales decline consisted of a 7 percentage point decrease from volume and a 4 percentage point decrease from price, partially offset by a 1 percentage point contribution from higher sales of seasonal products and 1 percentage point from the timing of the holidays. Sales to all customer end markets were down versus the prior year.

The business in Canada posted a $10 million operating loss in the 2016 fourth quarter. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 6.7 percentage points versus the prior year, primarily due to price deflation versus cost inflation and higher freight costs from the increase in shipping direct to customers. Operating expenses in Canada were down 7 percent in the quarter. 

Other Businesses

Sales for the Other Businesses increased 11 percent for the 2016 fourth quarter versus the prior year and 13 percent on a daily basis, composed of volume and price. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was primarily driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States. 

The Other Businesses posted an operating loss of $36 million in the 2016 fourth quarter versus $9 million of operating earnings in the 2015 fourth quarter. The decline versus the prior year was driven by the impairment for Fabory and Colombia, partially offset by strong operating performance from MonotaRO and Zoro U.S. Excluding the items noted above, adjusted operating expenses were up 14 percent and adjusted operating earnings were up 63 percent versus the prior year.

Other 

Other income and expense was a net expense of $29 million in the 2016 fourth quarter versus a net expense of $17 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. This increase was primarily due to additional interest expense from the $400 million of debt issued in May 2016 used to buy back stock and higher losses from the company’s clean energy investments.

The effective tax rate in 2016 was 53.0 percent for the quarter and 37.9 percent for the full year. Excluding the effect of the items detailed in the tables above, the adjusted tax rate was 37.1 percent for the quarter and 36.7 percent for the full year, compared to 39.2 percent for the 2015 quarter and 37.6 percent for full year 2015. The company’s clean energy investment generated $0.15 per share of earnings for the year. The company is currently projecting a tax rate of 36.0 to 37.0 percent for 2017, unchanged from the prior projection on November 11, 2016. 

Cash Flow

Operating cash flow was $333 million in the 2016 fourth quarter versus $254 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. The company used the cash generated during the quarter and proceeds from the May 2016 debt offering to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures were $71 million in the 2016 fourth quarter versus $121 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Unaudited)

(In thousands of dollars)

The company supplemented the reporting of financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including free cash flow and "adjusted" measures, including adjusted operating earnings, adjusted segment operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Free cash flow is not defined under GAAP. The company defines free cash flow as net cash flow provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of assets. The company believes free cash flow is meaningful to investors as a useful measure of performance and the company uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. Adjusted measures exclude items that may not be indicative of core operating results. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance. Management believes adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share are important indicators of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported results. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of operations that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of the business. The company strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review company financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

The reconciliations provided below reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted operating earnings, adjusted segment operating earnings and free cash flow with GAAP financial measures:
