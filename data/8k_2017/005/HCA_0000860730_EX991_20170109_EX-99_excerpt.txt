Supplemental Non-GAAP Disclosures  

2016 Operating Results Forecast  

(Dollars in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company’s forecasted operating results are based on current expectations and are subject to finalization of the Company’s fourth quarter financial and accounting procedures.  

 (a) Income before income taxes, excluding gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We believe income before income taxes, excluding gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, and Adjusted EBITDA are important measures that supplement discussions and analysis of our results of operations. We believe it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our results of operations on the same basis used by management. Management relies upon income before income taxes, excluding gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, and Adjusted EBITDA as primary measures to review and assess operating performance of its health care facilities and their management teams.  

Management and investors review both the overall performance (including income before income taxes, excluding gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, and GAAP income before income taxes) and operating performance (Adjusted EBITDA) of our health care facilities. Adjusted EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues) are utilized by management and investors to compare our current operating results with the corresponding periods during the previous year and to compare our operating results with other companies in the health care industry. Gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs are very difficult to predict, can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our health care facilities and complicate period comparisons of our results of operations and operations comparisons with other health care companies.  

Income before income taxes, excluding gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to income before income taxes or net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., as a measure of operating performance, or cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as a measure of liquidity. Because income before income taxes, excluding gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, income before income taxes, excluding gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
