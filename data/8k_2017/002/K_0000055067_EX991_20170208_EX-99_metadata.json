        "As a result of our decision to change the exchange rate that we use to remeasure our Venezuela subsidiary from DIPRO (formerly CENCOEX) to the DICOM (formerly SIMADI) exchange rate beginning mid-2015, the methodology we use to calculate the impact of foreign currency translation, as described above, results in certain key performance metrics that are difficult to interpret when Venezuela is included in the financial results. The impact of this change in Venezuela exchange rates on year-over-year performance metrics is anticipated to be most significant for the four quarters ended July 2, 2016. To provide additional visibility to our business performance, we have also included key performance metrics excluding our Venezuela business. We believe the use of our standard currency-neutral methodology in combination with the additional visibility provided by excluding Venezuela from our key performance metrics provides important information to more fully understand currency-neutral operating results during this four-quarter transition."
