Financial Summary  

All comparative percentages are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.  

All revenue, non-GAAP, and geographic financial information in the “Q2 FY 2017 Highlights” section is presented excluding the SP Video CPE Business for prior periods as it was divested during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 on November 20, 2015.  

Q2 FY 2017 Highlights  

Revenue — Total revenue was $11.6 billion, down 2%, with product revenue down 4% and service revenue up 5%. Revenue by geographic segment was: Americas down 3%, EMEA flat, and APJC down 3%. Product revenue performance was led by Security which increased 14%. Collaboration and Wireless product revenue increased by 4% and 3%, respectively. NGN Routing, Switching and Data Center product revenue decreased by 10%, 5% and 4%, respectively. Service Provider Video product revenue decreased by 41%.  

Gross Margin — On a GAAP basis, total gross margin and product gross margin were 62.8% and 61.1%, respectively. The decrease in the product gross margin compared with 61.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was primarily due to pricing and to a lesser extent product mix, partially offset by continued productivity improvements and the divestiture of the SP Video CPE Business.  

Non-GAAP total gross margin and product gross margin were 64.1% and 62.4%, respectively. The decrease in non-GAAP product gross margin compared with 63.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was primarily due to pricing and to a lesser extent product mix, partially offset by continued productivity improvements.  

GAAP service gross margin was 67.7% and non-GAAP service gross margin was 68.8%.  

Total gross margins by geographic segment were: 64.4% for the Americas, 65.6% for EMEA and 60.4% for APJC.

Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.8 billion, down 2%, and were 33.0% of revenue. Headcount compared with the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased by 426 to 71,959, driven by our fiscal 2017 restructuring actions that began in the first quarter, offset by additional headcount primarily in our investments in key growth areas.  

Operating Income — GAAP operating income was $2.9 billion, down 12%, with GAAP operating margin of 25.0%. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.6 billion, down 3%, with non-GAAP operating margin at 31.0%.

Announced Acquisition of AppDynamics — On January 24, 2017, Cisco announced its intent to acquire AppDynamics, Inc., a privately held application intelligence software company. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The third quarter of fiscal 2016 included an extra week which resulted in higher revenue of $265 million and higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million resulting in $115 million of non-GAAP operating income in that quarter.

(1) GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 included two supplier component related items as follows: 1) a pre-tax charge to product cost of sales of $125 million related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widely-used clock-signal component sourced from a third party which is included in several of the Company’s products, and 2) a pre-tax adjustment (reduction to product cost of sales) of $141 million to a liability originally recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, related to lower than expected defects and future costs of remediation of issues with products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier.  

(2) The sale of the SP Video CPE Business resulted in a pre-tax gain of $286 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The gain on this transaction was excluded from non-GAAP net income for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2016.

Forward Looking Statements, Non-GAAP Information and Additional Information  

This release may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding future events (such as our continued customer momentum, our ability to accelerate innovation across our portfolio, our ability to successfully close the acquisition of AppDynamics and to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition, growth in key business areas of collaboration, security and services, the transformation of our business to software and recurring revenues, and our ability to execute well and return value to our shareholders) that involve risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results due to a variety of factors, including: business and economic conditions and growth trends in the networking industry, our customer markets and various geographic regions; global economic conditions and uncertainties in the geopolitical environment; overall information technology spending; the growth and evolution of the Internet and levels of capital spending on Internet-based systems; variations in customer demand for products and services, including sales to the service provider market and other customer markets; the return on our investments in certain priorities, key growth areas, and in certain geographical locations, as well as maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services; the timing of orders and manufacturing and customer lead times; changes in customer order patterns or customer mix; insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; variability of component costs; variations in sales channels, product costs or mix of products sold; our ability to successfully acquire businesses and technologies and to successfully integrate and operate these acquired businesses and technologies; our ability to achieve expected benefits of our partnerships; increased competition in our product and service markets, including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid technological and market change; manufacturing and sourcing risks; product defects and returns; litigation involving patents, intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters, and governmental investigations; our ability to achieve the benefits of the announced restructuring and possible changes in the size and timing of the related charges; man-made problems such as cyber-attacks, data protection breaches, computer viruses or terrorism; natural catastrophic events; a pandemic or epidemic; our ability to achieve the benefits anticipated from our investments in sales, engineering, service, marketing and manufacturing activities; our ability to recruit and retain key personnel; our ability to manage financial risk, and to manage expenses during economic downturns; risks related to the global nature of our operations, including our operations in emerging markets; currency fluctuations and other international factors; changes in provision for income taxes, including changes in tax laws and regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our income tax returns; potential volatility in operating results; and other factors listed in Cisco’s most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed on November 22, 2016 and September 8, 2016, respectively. The financial information contained in this release should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Cisco’s most recent report on Form 10-K as it may be amended from time to time. Cisco’s results of operations for the three and six months ended January 28, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of Cisco’s operating results for any future periods. Any projections in this release are based on limited information currently available to Cisco, which is subject to change. Although any such projections and the factors influencing them will likely change, Cisco will not necessarily update the information, since Cisco will only provide guidance at certain points during the year. Such information speaks only as of the date of this release.  

This release includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP net income per share data, and free cash flow for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis.  

These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.  

Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. Cisco believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which it defines as the net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment, to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of its intent to return a stated  

13  

 percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Cisco further regards free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in its business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock and pay dividends on its common stock, after deducting capital investments.  

For its internal budgeting process, Cisco’s management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation and other contingencies, significant gains and losses on investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing and significant tax matters. Cisco’s management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. For additional information on the items excluded by Cisco from one or more of its non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the Form 8-K regarding this release furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Cisco divested the Customer Premises Equipment portion of the Service Provider Video Connected Devices business (“SP Video CPE Business”) during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 on November 20, 2015. This release includes, where indicated, financial measures that exclude the SP Video CPE Business. Cisco believes that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations because the SP Video CPE Business is no longer part of Cisco and will not be part of Cisco on a go forward basis. Cisco’s management also uses the financial measures excluding the SP Video CPE Business in reviewing the financial results of Cisco.
