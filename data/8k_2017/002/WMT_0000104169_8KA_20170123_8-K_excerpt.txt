 As previously reported by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment to the Initial Form 8-K to provide information regarding Mr. Furner’s compensation in connection with his new position.

On January 23, 2017, the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the “CMDC”) of the Company’s Board of Directors approved the terms of Mr. Furner’s compensation for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”). For fiscal 2018, Mr. Furner will receive an annual salary of $780,000, subject to annual adjustment. Mr. Furner will also be eligible for an annual cash incentive under the Company’s Management Incentive Plan (the “MIP”), based on performance criteria to be established by the CMDC. For fiscal 2018, Mr. Furner’s target cash incentive payment under the MIP will be 180% of his base salary, with a maximum possible payout of 225% of his base salary.

As part of Mr. Furner’s annual equity award, on January 23, 2017, the CMDC approved an annual award of 22,506 restricted shares of Company common stock, par value $0.10 per share (“Common Stock”), which will vest on approximately the third anniversary of the date of grant, provided that Mr. Furner continues to be employed by the Company through that vesting date. Also on January 23, 2017, as the remainder of Mr. Furner’s annual equity award, the CMDC approved an award of 76,519 performance-based restricted stock units, which provide the right to receive shares of Common Stock if certain performance goals to be established by the CMDC are achieved, provided also that Mr. Furner remains employed by the Company through January 31, 2020. On January 23, 2017, Mr. Furner also received an additional award of 70,945 performance-based restricted stock units in connection with his promotion, which award will vest on January 31, 2018, provided that certain performance goals to be established by the CMDC are achieved, and provided that Mr. Furner remains employed by the Company through January 31, 2018.
