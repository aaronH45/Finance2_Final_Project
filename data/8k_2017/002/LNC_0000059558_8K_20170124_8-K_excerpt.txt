Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year 

Effective January 24, 2017, the Board of Directors of Lincoln National Corporation ("LNC" or the "Company"), on recommendation of the Company's Corporate Governance Committee, approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), to implement proxy access as a means for the Company's shareholders to include shareholder-nominated director candidates in the Company's proxy materials for its annual meeting of shareholders. The approved proxy access will first be available to shareholders in connection with the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 

The Bylaws include new sections 14 and 15 in Article 1 that permit a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least three percent of the Company's outstanding stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company's annual meeting proxy materials, director nominees constituting up to the greater of two directors or twenty percent of the Board, provided that the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the eligibility, procedural and other requirements specified in the Bylaws. Certain of the eligibility requirements, including completion of a customary director questionnaire and a representation agreement disclosing voting commitments and outside compensation, also apply to director nominations made pursuant to Section 11. 

This description of the amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amendment, which is attached as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
