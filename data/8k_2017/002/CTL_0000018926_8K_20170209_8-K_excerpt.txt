On February 9, 2017, the preliminary marketing term sheet attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (the “Term Sheet”) was distributed to certain potential institutional loan investors in connection with the debt financing for CenturyLink, Inc.’s previously announced acquisition of Level 3 Communications, Inc.  

While the Term Sheet was distributed for marketing purposes, it does not represent the final terms of the senior credit facilities described therein, which will only be determined when definitive documentation for such facilities is entered into, and which terms will reflect the outcome of negotiations and market developments. Any changes to the terms set forth in the Term Sheet may be material.  

The information contained in the Term Sheet has been prepared solely for informational purposes and is not an offer to sell or purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase any securities.  

The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, nor shall it be deemed subject to the requirements of amended Item 10 of Regulation S-K, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing of CenturyLink, Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing. The furnishing of this information hereby shall not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any such information.
