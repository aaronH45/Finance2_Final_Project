Thanks in part to the all-new Super Duty, which raised the bar with its all-new chassis and high-strength military grade aluminum alloy body, updated powertrains and up to 20 segment-exclusive features. Lincoln had a strong 2016, with sales up 24 percent globally, 17 percent in the U.S. and nearly triple in China. The company sold 159,000 vehicles while also receiving third–party recognition for product appeal, quality and customer satisfaction. San Francisco-based Chariot, an app-based, crowd-sourced ride-sharing service, was expanded to Austin, Texas in the fourth quarter. Chariot will expand to eight cities by the end of 2017, including at least one global city. Chariot Ride-Sharing Service In December, Ford launched the next-generation Fusion Hybrid Autonomous Development Vehicle, bringing its test fleet size to 30 vehicles making it one of the largest in the auto industry. In 2017, the company plans to triple the size of the fleet for a total of about 90 vehicles. “We achieved a solid 2016 net income of $4.6 billion, as well as an adjusted pre-tax company profit of $10.4 billion, which was our second best ever – building on the all-time record we had set the year before. This underscores the substantial progress we are making in expanding our business to be an auto and a mobility company. This year, we’re focused on building on our strengths, transforming underperforming parts of our business and investing in the emerging opportunities that will provide even more profitable growth in the future.” Mark Fields, President & CEO Adjusted Pre-Tax Profit Automotive Segment Automotive Segment Net Income (Non-GAAP) Revenue Wholesales Operating Margin Operating Cash Flow $4.6B $10.4B $151.8B 6,651K 6.7% $6.4B $(2.8)B $(0.4)B $2.2B 16K (0.1) ppts $(0.9)B $(0.8)B $2.1B $38.7B 1,707K 5.7% $1.5B $(2.7)B $(0.5)B $(1.6)B (68)K (0.4) ppts $(0.6)B  Full-year net income $4.6B, down $2.8B from a year ago due to $3.0B 4Q pre-tax pension remeasurement; full-year total company adjusted pre-tax profit $10.4B, down slightly from a year ago  Full-year earnings per share $1.15, down $0.69 from a year ago; adjusted earnings per share $1.76, down $0.17  Second-best profit sharing payments to more than 56,000 eligible hourly UAW-represented employees; approximately $9,000 for employees on a full-year basis  Full-year global market share of 7.3 percent, down one-tenth of a percentage point from a year ago  Full-year Automotive segment pre-tax profit $9.4B, down $0.1B; Automotive segment operating margin 6.7 percent, down 0.1 ppts; both close to the record results in 2015  North America full-year operating margin 9.7 percent, including record 4Q operating margin of 8.5 percent  Record full-year performance in Europe; $1.2 billion pre-tax profit and operating margin of 4.2 percent; Asia Pacific, second-best full-year pre-tax profit of $627M  Automotive operations outside North America delivered a full-year profit of $421 million, nearly double 2015  Strong cash and liquidity including Automotive cash of $27.5B; cash net of debt $11.6B  Full-Year Automotive segment operating cash flow $6.4B, down $0.9B from a year ago  Ford Credit full-year pre-tax profit of $1.9B  Launched 11 global products in 2016, including first all-new F-Series Super Duty in 18 years, the flagship Lincoln Continental and Focus RS  Rewarded shareholders by distributing $3.5 billion, including first supplemental dividend of $1 billion  2017 guidance: Consistent with previous guidance, 2017 company outlook generally lower than 2016, driven by investments in emerging opportunities

The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends, and a means to assess our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. Total Company Adjusted Pre-tax Profit (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net income attributable to Ford) – The non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our pre-tax results excluding pre-tax special items. Pre-tax special items consist of (i) pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses that are not reflective of our underlying business results, (ii) significant restructuring actions related to our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, and (iii) other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings Per Share) – Measure of Company’s diluted net earnings per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), and tax special items. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of underlying run rate of our business. The following slides provide reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to most comparable GAAP measures. * The fourth quarter calculation of Earnings Per Share – Diluted (GAAP) excludes the 26 million shares of net dilutive options and unvested restricted stock units due to their antidilutive effect 2016 4Q FY Diluted After-Tax Results (Mils) Diluted After-tax results (GAAP) $ (783) $ 4,596 Less: Impact of Pre-tax and tax special items (2,001) (2,458) Adjust N t Income – Diluted (Non-GAAP) $ 1,218 $ 7,054 B s a d Diluted Shares (Mils) B ic h res (Average shares outstanding) $ 3,974 $ 3,973 Net dilutive options and unvested restricted stock units 26 26 Diluted Shares $ 4,000 $ 3,999 Earnings Per Share – Diluted (GAAP)* $ (0.20) $ 1.15 Less: Net impact of adjustments (0.50) (0.61) Adjusted Earnings Per Share – Diluted (Non-GAAP) $ 0.30 $ 1.76
