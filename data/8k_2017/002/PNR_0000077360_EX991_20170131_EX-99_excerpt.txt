LONDON, United Kingdom — January 31, 2017— Pentair plc (NYSE: PNR) today announced fourth quarter 2016 sales of $1.2 billion. Sales were down 8 percent compared to sales for the same period last year. Excluding currency translation ("FX"), core sales declined 7 percent in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations ("EPS") were $0.60 compared to $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2015. On an adjusted basis, the company reported EPS of $0.78 compared to $0.88 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Segment income, adjusted net income, free cash flow, and adjusted EPS are described in the attached schedules.

Fourth quarter 2016 operating income was $162 million, down 6 percent compared to operating income for fourth quarter of 2015, and return on sales ("ROS") was 13.6 percent, an increase of 30 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. On an adjusted basis, the company reported segment income of $204 million for the fourth quarter, down 11 percent compared to segment income for the fourth quarter of 2015, and ROS was 17.2 percent, a decrease of 50 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.

Full year net cash provided by operating activities was $861 million and total free cash flow was $770 million. Full year net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $702 million and free cash flow from continuing operations was $609 million. The company delivered full year free cash flow of 109 percent of adjusted net income.

Pentair paid dividends of $0.34 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Pentair previously announced on December 8, 2016 that its Board of Directors approved a 3 percent increase in the company's regular annual cash dividend rate for 2017 to $1.38 from $1.34. 2017 marks the 41st consecutive year that Pentair has increased its dividend.

"Including the ERICO acquisition we were able to deliver 6 percent sales growth, 11 percent segment income growth, and free cash flow from continuing operations of $609 million, or 109 percent conversion of adjusted net income despite the challenges that we faced from an uncertain global economic environment in 2016," said Randall J. Hogan, Pentair Chairman and CEO. “We still believe the sale of our Valves & Controls business will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017, at which point we will have a dramatically improved balance sheet and be positioned to allocate resources in a disciplined manner. We have also issued 2017 guidance that calls for adjusted EPS growth of 15 percent as we continue to position Pentair to deliver more consistent, predictable results.”
