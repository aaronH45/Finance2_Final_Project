PRINCETON, NJ - February 28, 2017 - NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG) today reported full year 2016 net loss of $891 million, or $2.22 per diluted common share. The loss and resulting loss per share were driven by a $1.2 billion impairment of goodwill and fixed assets as forecasted gas and power prices continue to decline. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2016 was $3.3 billion, cash from operations was $2.1 billion and FCFbG was $1.2 billion. Additionally, NRG realized its second best safety year in company history with a full year top decile recordable rate of 0.624. 

“Our business delivered a year of strong results, both EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, driven by Retail, which had a record 2016 adjusted EBITDA and its third consecutive year of EBITDA growth,” said Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our focus on strategic priorities and strong execution in 2016 sets the foundation for 2017, allowing us to seize market opportunities while continuing to streamline the business, strengthen the balance sheet and deliver value to shareholders.”

Consolidated Financial Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 $100 million savings driven by reduction of debt since 3rd quarter of 2015, preferred stock redemption and extension of maturities at lower interest rates

Segment Results 

As part of its streamlining strategy, NRG has realigned its reporting segments to more clearly report Generation and Retail activities. Accordingly, customer-facing businesses will now reside in the Retail segment. The Company's Retail segment will now include Business Solutions which includes Commercial & Industrial (C&I) previously in Generation, and the Generation segment now includes BETM. The results of the Company have been recast to reflect these changes.

d.See Appendices A-1 through A-4 for Operating Segment Reg G results.

Generation: Full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion, $254 million lower than 2015 primarily driven by:

•Gulf Coast Region: $93 million decrease due to lower average realized energy margins in Texas from the decline in power prices, offset by lower operating costs. 

•East Region: $365 million decrease from lower dispatch and capacity prices, partially offset by the monetization of forward hedges and lower operating costs on decreased run times, deactivations and plant sales. 

•West Region: $122 million increase due to gains from sale of real property at Potrero site, emission credit sales and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower capacity revenues.

•Other Generation: $82 million increase driven by favorable trading results at BETM.

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $160 million, $140 million lower than the fourth quarter 2015 primarily driven by:

•Gulf Coast Region: $22 million decrease due to lower realized energy margins in Texas.

•East Region: $128 million lower due to lower realized energy margins and lower capacity prices. 

5 Total impairments of $5.1 billion net of taxes of $1.8 billion

2

•West Region: $11 million increase due to higher capacity revenues and lower operating costs. 

Retail: Full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA was $811 million, $18 million higher than 2015 driven by lower costs, increased retail margins and favorable settlement of a Texas sales tax audit, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from selling back excess supply due to milder weather conditions in 2016 as compared to 2015 and lower volumes driven by lower average customer usage.

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $134 million, $15 million lower than the fourth quarter 2015 due primarily to an increase in spend associated with customer growth initiatives.

Renewables:  Full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA was $187 million, $29 million higher than 2015 due mainly to increased generation at Ivanpah and Mountain Wind and lower operating expenses while fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $1 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased generation at Ivanpah.

NRG Yield: Full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA was $899 million, $141 million higher than 2015 due primarily to increased wind production from Renewables, full year contributions from the acquisitions of Desert Sunlight and Spring Canyon which closed in 2015, and a receipt of insurance proceeds from a 2014 wind outage claim.

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $207 million, $18 million higher than the fourth quarter 2015 due primarily to increased production in the Renewables segment and a receipt of insurance proceeds from a 2014 wind outage claim.

Corporate: Full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA was $(145) million, $157 million better than 2015 due to reduced operating expenses at Residential Solar and other expense reductions, also driving the fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA which was $48 million favorable to 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Table 3: Corporate Liquidity

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

a.December 31, 2016, balance includes $247 million of unrestricted cash held at Midwest Generation (a non-guarantor subsidiary) which can be distributed to NRG without limitation. 

NRG-Level cash as of December 31, 2016, was $570 million, a decrease of $123 million from the end of 2015, and $1.2 billion was available under the Company’s credit facilities at the end of 2016. Total liquidity was $3.6 billion, including restricted cash and cash at non-guarantor subsidiaries (primarily GenOn and NRG Yield).

NRG Strategic Developments 

Drop Down Assets and Expanded ROFO Pipeline

In December 2016, NRG offered NRG Yield the opportunity to purchase the following assets: (i) the Minnesota Portfolio, a 40 MW portfolio of wind projects; (ii) the 30 MW Community wind projects; (iii) the 50 MW Jeffers wind projects; and (iv) a 16% interest in the 290 MW Agua Caliente solar facility, pursuant to the ROFO Agreement. In addition to these ROFO Assets, NRG also offered NRG Yield the opportunity to purchase NRG's 50% interests in seven utility-scale solar projects located in Utah, representing 265 net MW of capacity6.

On February 24, 2017, NRG entered into a definitive agreement with NRG Yield to drop down the Agua Caliente and Utah utility-scale solar projects (311 net MW) for cash consideration of $130 million, plus assumed non-recourse project debt of approximately $464 million7, excluding working capital and other adjustments. Details of the projects, which are expected to close in the second quarter of 2017, include:

•A 16% interest (approximately 31% of NRG's 51% interest) in the Agua Caliente solar project, one of the ROFO Assets, representing ownership of approximately 46 net MW of capacity. Prior to the agreement, on February 17, 2017, NRG decreased its equity investment through an incremental $128 million non-recourse project-level note, after fees, all of which was distributed to NRG. 

6 Reflects NRG's net interest based on cash to be distributed in tax equity partnership with Dominion

7 Approximately $328 million on balance sheet and $136 million pro-rata share of unconsolidated debt

•NRG's 50% interest in seven utility-scale solar projects located in Utah representing 265 net MW of capacity. NRG acquired the Utah assets in November 2016 for upfront cash consideration of $111 million and subsequent to closing reduced the effective cash consideration paid to $63 million as a result of additional non-recourse project-level financings of $48 million8 during the fourth quarter of 2016. 

NRG Yield elected not to pursue the acquisition of the Minnesota, Community and Jeffers wind projects at this time, but may continue its evaluation of the projects. NRG Yield has retained the right with NRG, pursuant to the ROFO Agreement, to participate in any third party process to the extent NRG elected to pursue a third party sale of these assets.

In connection with the execution of the definitive agreement, NRG and NRG Yield entered into an amendment to the ROFO Agreement to expand the ROFO Assets pipeline with the addition of 234 net MW of utility-scale solar projects. These assets include:

•Buckthorn Solar, a 154 net MW facility located in Texas with a 25-year PPA with City of Georgetown

•The Hawaii Solar projects, which have a combined capacity of 80 net MW with an average PPA of 22 years with the Hawaiian Electric Company9 

Fleet Optimizations 

NRG achieved a significant milestone in its fleet optimization strategy, completing coal-to-gas projects at three generation facilities across its fleet. The modified units can generate approximately 2.2 GW. The three plants include the Joliet Generating Station (three units converted by fourth quarter 2016 for a total of 1,326 MW), the Shawville Generating Station (all four units are currently in final commissioning following modification for a total of 597 MW) and the New Castle Generating Station, (all three units have been modified by second quarter 2016 for a total of 325 MW). 

Over 2016, NRG continued to grow renewables development opportunities with acquisitions of 1.7GW of wind and solar assets. As of December 2016, NRG held 543 MW of backlog in execution across the utility wind and solar, community solar and DG solar businesses. Over the fourth quarter 2016, NRG accelerated utility project origination across CAISO, ERCOT and ISO-NE, growing the project pipeline to approximately 3.3 GW, a 25% increase over the previous quarter. NRG successfully transitioned 2.7 GW of the combined NRG and NYLD fleet (approximately 26 wind and 7 solar projects) to self-perform operations in 2016, including Alta and CVSR.

On December 29, 2016, NRG completed, on time and on budget, construction and final acceptance of performance testing at the Petra Nova project, the world's largest post-combustion carbon capture system. During performance testing, the facility captured more than 90% of CO2 from a 240 MW equivalent slipstream of flue gas off an existing coal-fueled electrical generating unit at the WA Parish power plant in Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston. At this level of operation, Petra Nova can capture more than 5,000 tons of CO2 per day, which is the equivalent of taking more than 350,000 cars off the road. 

In 2016, NRG completed the installation of environmental control upgrades at its 638 MW Avon Lake Unit 9 facility (COD June 2016) and its 1,538 MW Powerton coal facility (COD December 2016). 

2017 Guidance

Combined with the debt repurchases in 2015 and the extension of debt maturities at a lower average coupon rate, NRG has realized annual interest savings of approximately $87 million, plus an additional $10 million in dividend savings from the repurchase of 100% of its outstanding $345 million, 2.822% convertible perpetual preferred stock. NRG is also announcing $200 million of additional capital reserved for debt reduction bringing total 2017 allocation to discretionary debt reduction to $600 million. 

On January 18, 2017, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.03 per share, payable February 15, 2017, to stockholders of record as of February 1, 2017, representing $0.12 on an annualized basis.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that NRG’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

EBITDA represents net income before interest (including loss on debt extinguishment), taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented because NRG considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes debt-holders frequently use EBITDA to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

•EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments;

•EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;

•EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments;

•Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

•Other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA differently than NRG does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of NRG’s business. NRG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. See the statements of cash flow included in the financial statements that are a part of this news release.

Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of operating performance. As NRG defines it, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding impairment losses, gains or losses on sales, dispositions or retirements of assets, any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, adjustments to exclude the Adjusted EBITDA related to the non-controlling interest, gains or losses on the repurchase, modification or extinguishment of debt, the impact of restructuring and any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items plus 

23

adjustments to reflect the Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons NRG considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, the reader should be aware that in the future NRG may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release.

Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of NRG's financial statements in evaluating its operating performance because it provides an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods and adjusts for items that we do not consider indicative of NRG’s future operating performance. This measure is widely used by debt-holders to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity and by equity investors to measure our operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations, and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with NRG's Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts and investors concerning its financial performance.

Adjusted cash flow from operating activities is a non-GAAP measure NRG provides to show cash from operations with the reclassification of net payments of derivative contracts acquired in business combinations from financing to operating cash flow, as well as the add back of merger, integration and related restructuring costs. The Company provides the reader with this alternative view of operating cash flow because the cash settlement of these derivative contracts materially impact operating revenues and cost of sales, while GAAP requires NRG to treat them as if there was a financing activity associated with the contracts as of the acquisition dates. The Company adds back merger, integration related restructuring costs as they are one time and unique in nature and do not reflect ongoing cash from operations and they are fully disclosed to investors.

Free cash flow (before Growth) is adjusted cash flow from operations less maintenance and environmental capital expenditures, net of funding, preferred stock dividends and distributions to non-controlling interests and is used by NRG predominantly as a forecasting tool to estimate cash available for debt reduction and other capital allocation alternatives. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons NRG considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. Because we have mandatory debt service requirements (and other non-discretionary expenditures) investors should not rely on free cash flow before Growth as a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.

Free Cash Flow before Growth is utilized by Management in making decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Free Cash Flow before Growth is presented because the Company believes it is a useful tool for assessing the financial performance in the current period. In addition, NRG’s peers evaluate cash available for allocation in a similar manner and accordingly, it is a meaningful indicator for investors to benchmark NRG's performance against its peers. Free Cash Flow before Growth is a performance measure and is not intended to represent net income (loss), cash from operations (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure), or liquidity and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
