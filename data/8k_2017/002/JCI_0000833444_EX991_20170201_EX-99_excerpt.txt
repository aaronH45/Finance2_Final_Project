_________________________________________________________________________________________________

CORK, Ireland, Feb. 1, 2017 -- Johnson Controls International, plc (NYSE: JCI) today reported first quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) from continuing operations of $0.39. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.53, up 10 percent versus the prior year period. 

Reported sales of $7.1 billion were up slightly compared to the prior year. Organic sales growth of 1 percent and higher lead pass-through was mostly offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and net acquisition and divestiture activity. 

Earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) was $521 million and the EBIT margin was 7.4 percent. Adjusted EBIT was $757 million, up 10 percent over last year (up 13 percent excluding foreign exchange and lead cost increases) with adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 90 basis points, to 10.7 percent.

“First quarter results represent a solid start to the year as we begin executing against our 2017 priorities as a combined company,” said Alex Molinaroli, Johnson Controls chairman & CEO. Synergy and productivity benefits, along with strong growth in our global battery aftermarket business contributed to the 10 percent earnings growth in the first quarter,” said Molinaroli. “Integration activities are well underway and we expect the benefits of the combination will continue to ramp as the year progresses. Our strong first quarter performance, growing backlog in Buildings and continued favorable mix in Power, make us confident in our adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.60 to $2.75 for the year,” Molinaroli continued.

BUSINESS RESULTS

Building Technologies & Solutions (“Buildings”)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Buildings sales in the first quarter of 2017 were $5.2 billion, down 2 percent versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestiture activity, as well as foreign exchange, organic sales declined 1 percent versus the prior year, driven by a decline in product revenue.

Orders in the quarter, excluding M&A and adjusted for foreign exchange, increased 2 percent year-over-year, as 3 percent growth in field orders was partially offset by a 3 percent decline in product orders. Backlog at the end of the quarter of $8.1 billion, increased 6 percent year-over-year, excluding M&A and adjusted for foreign exchange.

Buildings adjusted segment EBITA was $578 million, up 3 percent versus the prior year (up 6 percent excluding foreign exchange). Adjusted segment EBITA margin of 11.1 percent increased 60 basis points compared with the prior year quarter as benefits from productivity and cost synergies more than offset incremental product and channel investments. 

Power Solutions 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Power Solutions sales in the first quarter of 2017 were $1.9 billion, an increase of 9 percent versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of higher lead pass-through and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 7 percent versus the prior year, with higher volumes in all regions. Global original equipment battery shipments were consistent with the prior year and aftermarket shipments increased 7 percent in the quarter. 

Power Solutions adjusted segment EBITA was $390 million, up 8 percent from the prior year quarter, due to higher volumes and favorable mix, partially offset by the impact of lead. Adjusted segment EBITA increased 12 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange and lead. Adjusted segment EBITA margin of 20.5 percent decreased 20 basis points compared with the prior year quarter, including a 110 basis point headwind related to the impact of lead. Excluding the impact of lead, segment EBITA margin increased 90 basis points year-over-year.

Non GAAP Financial Information

The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The adjusting items include mark-to-market for pension plans, transaction/integration/separation costs, restructuring and impairment costs, nonrecurring purchase accounting impacts related to the Tyco merger and discrete tax items. Financial information regarding adjusted sales, adjusted segment EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA margin are also presented, which are non-GAAP performance measures. Adjusted segment EBITA excludes special items such as transaction/integration/separation costs and nonrecurring purchase accounting impacts because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of its business units. Management believes that, when considered together with unadjusted amounts, these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results and business trends of the Company. Management may also use these metrics as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and for compensation purposes. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure.

FOOTNOTES

1. Financial Summary

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company began evaluating the performance of its business units primarily on segment earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA), which represents income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding general corporate expenses, intangible asset amortization, net financing charges, significant restructuring and impairment costs, and the net mark-to-market adjustments related to pension and postretirement plans. Historical information has been revised to present the comparable periods on a consistent basis. Also in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company began reporting the Automotive Experience business as a discontinued operation, which required retrospective application to previously reported financial information. As a result, the segment EBITA amounts shown below are for continuing operations and exclude the Automotive Experience business. In addition, the financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2015 excludes the Tyco business.

2. 2016 Supplemental Combined Information

As a result of the reverse merger between JCI and Tyco, which closed on September 2, 2016, the Company is providing supplemental combined financial information. As supplemental information that management believes will be useful to investors, the Company has provided unaudited selected historical information which combines JCI’s historical Building Efficiency business with historical Tyco results of operations as if these businesses had been operated together during the periods presented.

The merger is accounted for as a reverse acquisition with JCI considered to be acquiring Tyco for accounting purposes. As a result, the amounts reflected in Column A in the below table present the historical results of JCI, revised for the reporting changes described within footnote 1 above. The amounts in Column B reflect the impact of the special items, as set forth in the notes to the table and within footnote 1 above. The amounts in Column C reflect the inclusion of Tyco’s historical results for the period prior to the merger on an adjusted basis.

February 1, 2017

Page 11

For the avoidance of doubt, this supplemental combined information is not intended to be, and was not, prepared on a basis consistent with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in Exhibit 99.3 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed October 3, 2016 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Pro Forma 8-K/A Filing”), which provides the pro forma financial information required by Item 9.01(b) of Form 8-K. The supplemental combined information is intentionally different from, but does not supersede, the pro forma financial information in the Pro Forma 8-K/A Filing. 

In addition, the supplemental combined information does not purport to indicate the results that actually would have been obtained had the JCI and Tyco businesses been operated together on the basis of the new segment structure during the periods presented, or which may be realized in the future. 

Amounts Adjusted for Certain Special Items 

The supplemental combined information includes line items, such as net sales, income from continuing operations before income taxes, income tax provision, noncontrolling interest, net income and diluted EPS, that have been adjusted for the special items set forth in the notes to the table. Such amounts should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, net sales, income from continuing operations before income taxes, income tax provision, noncontrolling interest, net income and diluted EPS and other financial measures on an unadjusted basis. In addition, per share amounts presented in the tables take into account the effects of (i) the issuance of ordinary shares to JCI shareholders in connection with the merger, and (ii) the consolidation of Tyco ordinary shares immediately prior to the merger. As a result, share counts reflect shares outstanding as of September 2, 2016 immediately following the consummation of the merger transaction.

The Company’s management believes that these adjusted amounts, when considered together with the unadjusted amounts, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. The Company’s management also believes that these adjusted amounts enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in the Company’s underlying business and to better understand the Company’s performance. In addition, the Company may utilize adjusted amounts as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for compensation purposes. Adjusted amounts should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, unadjusted amounts. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

A - Johnson Controls, as reported.

B - Adjusted to exclude special items because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of the Company. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in better understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company. The special items are described by line item in footnote 1 above. The income tax provision and noncontrolling interest adjustments are a result of the special items discussed in footnote 1.

C - Includes Tyco adjusted non-GAAP results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as if the merger occurred October 1, 2015. Tyco’s first three fiscal quarters of 2016 ended on the last Friday of December, March and June, while JCI’s fiscal quarters ended on the last day of each such month. Because the historical statements of income of each company represent full and equivalent quarterly periods, no adjustments were made to align the fiscal quarters. The income tax provision also includes an adjustment to arrive at an annualized 17% tax rate for fiscal 2016 as a combined company.

D - Combined financial information as if the merger with Tyco was completed on October 1, 2015. Reflects annual 17% tax rate and 940 million share count.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 4. Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation

The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The adjusting items include transaction/integration/separation costs, nonrecurring purchase accounting impacts related to the Tyco merger, mark-to-market gain for pension plans, restructuring and impairment costs, and discrete tax items. The Company excludes these items because they are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of the Company. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company. 

A reconciliation of diluted earnings per share as reported to diluted adjusted earnings per share for the respective periods is shown below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* May not sum due to rounding.

A reconciliation of the differences between earnings per share as reported and adjusted earnings per share provided on a forward-looking basis is not available due to the high variability of the net mark-to-market adjustments related to pension and postretirement plans and unpredictability of any other potential adjusting items.

The following table reconciles the denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share for JCI plc (in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

5. Mark-to-Market of Pension and Postretirement Plans

The pension and postretirement mark-to-market gain or loss for each period is excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share. The fiscal 2017 first quarter includes a mark-to-market gain for pension plans of $117 million due to lump sum payouts for certain U.S. pension plans in the quarter. There was no mark-to-market gain or loss for pension and postretirement plans in the fiscal 2016 first quarter.

6. Acquisitions and Divestitures

On October 31, 2016, the Company completed the spin-off of its Automotive Experience business by way of the transfer of the Automotive Experience business from JCI plc to Adient plc and the issuance of ordinary shares of Adient plc directly to holders of JCI plc ordinary shares on a pro rata basis. Following the separation, Adient plc is now an independent public company trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "ADNT." The Company did not retain any equity interest in Adient plc. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Adient’s historical financial results are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation. 

On September 2, 2016, JCI Inc. and Tyco completed their combination which was announced on January 25, 2016. The merger is accounted for as a reverse acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, "Business Combinations." JCI Inc. is the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the historical consolidated financial statements of JCI Inc. for periods prior to this transaction are considered to be the historical financial statements of the Company. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $19.7 billion. As part of the transaction in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, the Company recorded $16.4 billion of goodwill and $6.2 billion of intangible assets, of which $3.9 billion are subject to amortization.

On October 1, 2015, the Company formed a joint venture with Hitachi to expand its legacy Building Efficiency product offerings. The Company acquired a 60 percent ownership stake in the new entity for approximately $133 million ($563 million purchase price less cash acquired of $430 million).

7. Income Taxes

The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations before consideration of the transaction/integration/separation costs, nonrecurring purchase accounting impacts related to the Tyco merger, mark-to-market gain for pension plans, restructuring and impairment costs, and discrete tax items for the quarter ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 is approximately 15 percent and 21 percent, respectively. The fiscal 2017 first quarter includes $101 million ($0.11) of discrete tax benefits in continuing operations related to changes in entity tax status and $23 million ($0.02) of net one-time tax charges in discontinued operations associated with the spin-off of the Automotive Experience business.

8. Restructuring

The fiscal 2017 first quarter includes restructuring and impairment costs of $78 million related primarily to workforce reductions, plant closures and asset impairments in the Building Technologies & Solutions business and at Corporate.
