Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On January 5, 2017, Lennar Corporation (the “Company”) and the Guarantors (as defined below) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with the underwriters listed on Schedule I thereto with respect to the offering and sale in an underwritten public offering by the Company of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be guaranteed by most, but not all, of the Company’s subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”), but the guarantee by particular subsidiaries may be suspended or terminated under some circumstances. The Company plans to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund all or a portion of the cash consideration for the Company’s acquisition of WCI Communities, Inc., to pay related costs and expenses and for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment or repurchase of the Company’s debt.  

The offering has been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-199159, and the prospectus supplement dated January 5, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on January 9, 2017. The sale is expected to close on January 20, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. A legal opinion relating to the Notes is filed herewith as Exhibit 5.1.
