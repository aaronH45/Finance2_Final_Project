1On Jan. 18, 2017, Target updated fourth quarter guidance for comparable sales, GAAP EPS from continuing operations, and Adjusted EPS.

2Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the “Miscellaneous” section of this release, as well as the tables of this release, for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.

than $4.69 in 2015. The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS. 

“Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,” said Brian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target. “At our meeting with the financial community this morning, we will provide detail on the meaningful investments we’re making in our business and financial model which will position Target for long-term, sustainable growth in this new era in retail. We will accelerate our investments in a smart network of physical and digital assets as well as our exclusive and differentiated assortment, including the launch of more than 12 new brands, representing more than $10 billion of our sales, over the next two years. In addition, we will invest in lower gross margins to ensure we are clearly and competitively priced every day. While the transition to this new model will present headwinds to our sales and profit performance in the short term, we are confident that these changes will best-position Target for continued success over the long term.” 

Fiscal 2017 Guidance

Target’s 2017 guidance reflects the impact of the Company’s transition to a new financial model, which will be covered in the Company’s meeting with the financial community later today.

In first quarter 2017, Target expects a low-to-mid single digit decline in comparable sales, and both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS of $0.80 to $1.00. 

For full-year 2017, Target expects a low-single digit decline in comparable sales, and both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS of $3.80 to $4.20.

First quarter and full-year 2017 GAAP EPS from continuing operations may include the impact of certain discrete items, which will be excluded in calculating Adjusted EPS. In the past, these items have included losses on the early retirement of debt, data breach expenses, restructuring costs, and certain other items that are discretely managed. The Company is not currently aware of any such discrete items.

Segment Results

Fourth quarter 2016 sales decreased 4.3 percent to $20.7 billion from $21.6 billion last year, reflecting a 1.5 percent decline in comparable sales combined with the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year’s results. Comparable digital channel sales grew 34 percent and contributed 1.8 percentage points of comparable sales growth. Segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT), which is Target’s measure of segment profit, were $1,344 million in fourth quarter 2016, a decrease of 13.5 percent from $1,554 million in 2015.

Fourth quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were 9.5 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, compared with 9.8 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, in 2015. Fourth quarter gross margin rate was 26.9 percent, compared with 27.9 percent in 2015, reflecting markdown pressure from promotional and clearance activity and costs associated with the mix shift between the Company’s store and digital channels, partially offset by the benefit of the sale of the Company’s pharmacy and clinic businesses, a favorable merchandise mix, and cost of goods savings. Fourth quarter SG&A expense rate was 17.5 percent in 2016, compared with 18.1 percent in 2015, reflecting the benefit of the sale of the Company’s pharmacy and clinic businesses and continued expense discipline across the organization.

Interest Expense and Taxes from Continuing Operations

The Company’s fourth quarter 2016 net interest expense was $140 million, compared with $152 million last year. Fourth quarter 2016 effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 32.0 percent, compared with 29.6 percent last year. Last year’s tax rate reflected the impact of the gain on the December 2015 sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses.

Shareholder Returns

The Company returned $902 million to shareholders in fourth quarter 2016, including:

•Dividends of $337 million, compared with $345 million in fourth quarter 2015.

•Share repurchases totaling $565 million, including:

◦Open market transactions that retired 3.2 million shares of common stock at an average price of $66.52, for a total investment of $211 million.

◦An accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement that retired 4.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $76.77, for a total investment of $355 million. 

As expected, during the fourth quarter the Company completed its previous share repurchase program, which was approved in 2012 and extended to $10 billion in 2015. Upon completion of the prior program, the Company began repurchasing shares under its current $5 billion share repurchase program, which was approved in September 2016. Under the current program, the Company invested $264 million in the fourth quarter, leaving approximately $4.7 billion remaining under the current program at the end of the quarter.

For the trailing twelve months through fourth quarter 2016, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.0 percent, compared with 16.0 percent for the twelve months through fourth quarter 2015. Last year’s ROIC rate reflected the benefit of the gain on the December 2015 sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses. Excluding that benefit, ROIC for the twelve months through fourth quarter 2015 was 13.9 percent. See the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this release for additional information about the Company’s ROIC calculation.

The most important risks and uncertainties are described in Item 1A of the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, 2016.

In addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the Company provides Adjusted EPS for the three and twelve-month periods ended Jan. 28, 2017, and Jan. 30, 2016. The Company also provides ROIC for the twelve-month periods ended Jan. 28, 2017, and Jan. 30, 2016, which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases. Operating leases are capitalized as part of the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between the Company and its competitors. Adjusted EPS, capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Management believes Adjusted EPS is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of the Company’s ongoing retail operations. Management believes ROIC is useful in assessing the effectiveness of the Company’s capital allocation over time. The most comparable GAAP measure for Adjusted EPS is diluted EPS from continuing operations. The most comparable GAAP measure for capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest is total rent expense. Adjusted EPS, capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS and ROIC differently than the Company does, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes certain items presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

(b) Costs related to our corporate restructuring announced during the first quarter of 2015.

(c) For the three and twelve months ended January 28, 2017, represents items related to the Pharmacy Transaction. For the three and twelve months ended January 30, 2016, represents costs related to the 2013 data breach.

We have also disclosed after-tax return on invested capital for continuing operations (ROIC), which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases. Operating leases are capitalized as part of the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors. We believe this metric provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

(a) Represents the add-back to operating income to reflect the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as capital leases, using eight times our trailing twelve months rent expense and an estimated interest rate of six percent.

(b) See the following Reconciliation of Capitalized Operating Leases table for the adjustments to our GAAP total rent expense to obtain the hypothetical capitalization of operating leases and related operating lease interest. 

(c) Calculated using the effective tax rate for continuing operations, which was 32.7% and 32.5% for the trailing twelve months ended January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016. For the twelve months ended January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, includes tax effect of $1,624 million and $1,799 million, respectively, related to EBIT and $23 million and $28 million, respectively, related to operating lease interest.

(d) Calculated as eight times our trailing twelve months rent expense. 

(e) Average based on the invested capital at the end of the current period and the invested capital at the end of the prior period.

(f) Excluding the net gain on the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses, ROIC was 13.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 30, 2016.

Capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is total rent expense. Capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
