AIG REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2016 RESULTS  

TRANSFORMATIVE ACTIONS TAKEN DURING 2016  

NEW YORK, February 14, 2017 — American International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) today announced results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.  

“We took decisive actions in 2016 to dramatically reduce uncertainty and deliver higher quality, more sustainable earnings in the future,” said Peter D. Hancock, AIG President and Chief Executive Officer. “The comprehensive adverse reserve development cover significantly reduces the risk of further reserve additions in some of the most volatile lines, and we responded definitively to emerging severity trends that we believe are materially impacting the overall U.S. Casualty market. Going forward, we expect to see the results from our improved underwriting platform, reduced expense base, and the strong improvement in our business mix. We remain committed to continuing to execute our clearly defined transformation plan, as well as achieving our financial goals, including the return of the remainder of the $25 billion to shareholders we announced in January of last year subject to regulatory and rating agency considerations and future profitability improvements.”  

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR FINANCIAL SUMMARY*  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) - For periods reporting a loss, basic average common shares outstanding are used to calculate net income (loss) per diluted share.  

The Operating Portfolio is now referred to as Core to provide clarity and distinguish the name of this portfolio from the operating income metric, which is used across the businesses.  

All comparisons are against either fourth quarter or full year 2015, unless otherwise indicated.  

Refer to the AIG Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Supplement and our modular disclosures, which are posted on AIG’s website in the Investor Information section for further information.

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  

Transforming Reinsurance Strategy – During the first quarter of 2017, AIG entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary. The agreement retroactively covers the majority of U.S. long tail lines reserves for accident years 2015 and prior. Please refer to our press release regarding this agreement: http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=76115&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2238739  

Substantial Strengthening of Reserves – The fourth quarter included a $5.6 billion or ($3.56) per share impact from prior year adverse reserve development. Total full-year 2016 adverse development on subject lines of $5.3 billion is included under, and will be 80%, or $4.2 billion, covered by the adverse development reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company. This agreement covers roughly half of total Commercial Insurance loss reserves at the company and should generate a deferred pre-tax gain before discounting of approximately $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2017.  

Expense Reduction Ahead of Target – For the full-year, general operating and other expenses (GOE) declined $1.7 billion, or 13.4% to $11.0 billion from the prior year. On a constant dollar basis and excluding AIG Advisor Group, which was sold in 2016, operating GOE was down 9.7%.  

Definitive Progress on Sculpting the Portfolio – AIG completed or announced over 10 transactions which in the aggregate will generate approximately $10 billion of liquidity, most of which was received in 2016. Included in that amount was the sale of United Guaranty Corporation to Arch Capital Group Ltd. that closed on December 31, 2016.  

Capital and Liquidity Plan Actions – For the full-year 2016, AIG returned a total of $13.1 billion of capital to shareholders. AIG repurchased 47.5 million common shares for $3.0 billion and 2.4 million warrants for $46.0 million during the fourth quarter. Through February 14, 2017, AIG has repurchased an additional 18.4 million common shares for $1.2 billion. On February 14, 2017, AIG’s Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to its previous repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $3.5 billion, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization of approximately $4.7 billion. The company continues to maintain strong capital and liquidity ratios at year-end to meet the expectations of key stakeholders including clients and rating agencies.  

Improving Transparency Through Module Disclosure – AIG presented its new modular segmentation designed to provide greater transparency into each business and greater accountability across the firm to increase focus on profitability.  

CORE  

Commercial Insurance Highlights – In 2016, the Commercial Insurance business demonstrated clear underwriting conviction to improve its overall mix of business and utilize more rigorous pricing tools in U.S. casualty lines, which has been the primary driver of recent adverse development. Our experience in U.S. Casualty reflects aggregate exposures that have accumulated over AIG’s decades of underwriting long-tail business. The net premiums written associated with those lines have declined approximately 39% since the end of 2015, and the adverse development reinsurance agreement covers the majority of the U.S. Casualty reserves.  

   •   Commercial Insurance net premiums written decreased by 20.2% in the fourth quarter as a result of strategic portfolio actions and premiums ceded under the previously announced Swiss Re quota share transaction. For the full-year 2016, net premiums written declined 17.9% driven by the strategic remediation of certain underperforming casualty lines as well as greater use of reinsurance.  

2  

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

   •   The loss ratio was 211.5 in the quarter and included 125.2 points attributable to prior-year adverse reserve development and 8.1 points attributable to catastrophe losses. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, was 78.2, and included a 10.8 point increase arising from the impact of the reserve studies on premiums earned in the first three quarters of 2016. The full-year 2016 loss ratio was 104.0 which included 30.8 points of adverse reserve development. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, for 2016 following the fourth quarter reserve strengthening was 66.7, representing a 4.1 point improvement compared to the 2015 ratio inclusive of the impact of the 2016 reserve strengthening on 2015 results.  

   •   The expense ratio was 30.1 in the fourth quarter, flat compared to the prior year quarter as improvements in general operating expenses and ceding commissions received from reinsurers were offset by the strategic decline in premiums. For the full-year 2016, the expense ratio improved by 0.9 points driven by lower general operating expenses and higher ceding commissions received from reinsurers.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consumer Insurance Highlights – In 2016, the Consumer Insurance business made significant strategic progress by narrowing its focus and enhancing operating performance. Consumer Insurance executed the sale of AIG Advisor Group and announced agreements to sell Fuji Life as well as certain businesses in Latin America and Europe. In Japan, our largest market outside the U.S., the business continued its improvement in overall underwriting results and took significant actions to prepare for the legal entity merger. The announcement on February 13, 2017, setting the merger completion date of January 1, 2018 and pre-merger operations status to commence April 1, 2017, was a major milestone for the transformation of the business in Japan. The Personal Insurance business continued to see strong growth in the high-net worth space as well as improved profitability across all business lines. Group Retirement generated improved net flows due in part to investments in its client-focused technology platform, and AIG remained a top tier writer across Individual Retirement annuity product lines.  

3  

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

   •   Pre-tax operating income increased 55.8% in the fourth quarter, driven by significantly improved underwriting results in Personal Insurance and higher income from alternative investments in hedge funds across all Consumer Insurance operating segments.  

   •   In Individual Retirement, net flows for retail mutual funds and index annuities were positive in the fourth quarter, and sales of index annuities have slowed but continue to outpace the industry. Net flows for fixed annuities continued to be negative, reflecting disciplined pricing in the low interest rate environment. Variable annuity industry sales were negatively affected by a strategic decision to scale back living benefits in the low interest rate environment and uncertainty regarding the new Department of Labor fiduciary rule.  

   •   In Group Retirement, premiums were unchanged but premiums and deposits were up 5.8% in the fourth quarter while net flows were negative in the quarter primarily due to modestly higher seasonal surrenders. Spread compression year-over-year was due to reinvestment in the current low interest rate environment, but was more than offset by higher income from alternative investments.  

   •   In Life Insurance, lower general operating expenses and higher income from alternative investments were more than offset by reserve increases, related in part to administrative system conversions, resulting in a pre-tax operating loss in the quarter.  

   •   Personal Insurance had a strong quarter reflecting improved current accident year loss and expense ratio performance, together with favorable prior year loss reserve development, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.

LEGACY & OTHER  

Legacy Segment Highlights – In 2016, the Legacy segment monetized an additional $3.9 billion of assets resulting in a total of $7.1 billion of its goal to reach $9.0 billion of capital return by the end of 2017. Legacy attributed equity as a percentage of AIG adjusted shareholders’ equity decreased from 24% as of year-end 2015 to 18% as of year-end 2016.  

   •   During the quarter, an AIG sponsored Fund (the Korea Fund) completed the sale of commercial real estate in South Korea for total consideration of $2.5 billion and reported a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion included in Other income, of which $464 million was attributable to AIG’s controlling interest. Legacy also sold approximately 30% of the face value of its life settlement portfolio, reducing the company’s risk profile.  

   •   During the year, AIG closed the majority of its life reinsurance transactions and, subject to regulatory and rating agency considerations remains on track to deliver on the associated capital return target by the end of 2017.

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

COMMENT ON REGULATION G  

Throughout this press release, including the financial highlights, AIG presents its financial condition and results of operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and representative of its business results. Some of the measurements AIG uses are “non-GAAP financial measures” under Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for “accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.” The non-GAAP financial measures AIG presents may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Regulation G are included within the relevant tables or in the Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Supplement available in the Investor Information section of AIG’s website, www.aig.com.  

Book Value per Common Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and Book Value per Common Share Excluding AOCI and Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) (Adjusted Book Value per Common Share) and Adjusted Book Value per Common Share Including Dividend Growth are used to show the amount of AIG’s net worth on a per-share basis. AIG believes these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of AIG’s available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. These measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of AIG’s available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. AIG excludes deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. Book value per common share excluding AOCI, is derived by dividing Total AIG Shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by total common shares outstanding. Adjusted Book Value per Common Share is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding. Adjusted Book Value per Common Share including dividend growth is derived by dividing Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity including growth in quarterly dividends above $0.125 per share to shareholders, by total common shares outstanding.  

AIG Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Return on Equity) is used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. AIG believes this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of AIG’s available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of AIG’s available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. AIG excludes deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in Adjusted Return on Equity. Adjusted Return on Equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity.  

AIG Normalized Return on Equity further adjusts Adjusted Return on Equity for the effects of certain volatile or market related items. AIG believes this measure is useful to investors because it presents the trends in AIG’s consolidated return on equity without the impact of certain items that  

7  

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

 can experience volatility in AIG’s short-term results. Normalized Return on Equity is derived by excluding the following tax adjusted effects from Adjusted Return on Equity: the difference between actual and expected (i) catastrophe losses, (ii) alternative investment returns, and (iii) Direct Investment book (DIB) and Global Capital Markets (GCM) returns; fair value changes on PICC investments; update of actuarial assumptions; Life insurance incurred but not reported (IBNR) death claim charge; and prior year loss reserve development.  

AIG uses the following operating performance measures because it believes they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of AIG’s business segments. AIG believes they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG’s insurance competitors. When AIG uses these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis.  

After-tax Operating Income Attributable to AIG (ATOI) is derived by excluding the tax affected PTOI adjustments described and the following tax items from net income attributable to AIG:  

   •   deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges; and  

   •   uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance.  

See page 12 for the reconciliation of Net income attributable to AIG to After-tax Operating Income Attributable to AIG.  

Operating Revenues exclude Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). Operating revenues are a GAAP measure for our operating segments.  

General Operating Expenses, Operating Basis (Operating GOE), is derived by making the following adjustments to general operating and other expenses: include (i) certain loss adjustment expenses, reported as policyholder benefits and losses incurred and (ii) certain investment and other expenses reported as net investment income, and exclude (i) advisory fee expenses, (ii) non-deferrable insurance commissions, (iii) direct marketing and acquisition expenses, net of deferrals, (iv) non-operating litigation reserves and (v) other expense related to an asbestos retroactive reinsurance agreement. AIG uses general operating expenses, operating basis, because AIG believes it provides a more meaningful indication of AIG’s ordinary course of business operating costs, regardless of within which financial statement line item these expenses are reported externally within AIG’s segment results. The majority of these expenses are employee-related costs. For example, other acquisition and loss adjustment expenses primarily represent employee-related costs in the underwriting and claims functions, respectively. Excluded from this measure are non-operating expenses (such as restructuring costs and litigation reserves), direct marketing expenses, insurance company assessments and non-deferrable commissions. AIG also excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the expenses of AIG Advisor Group, which has been divested, when measuring period-over-period fluctuations in General Operating Expenses, Operating basis.

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

AIG uses the following operating performance measures because AIG believes they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of AIG’s business segments. AIG believes they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG’s insurance competitors. When AIG uses these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis.  

Pre-tax Operating Income (PTOI) is derived by excluding the following items from income from continuing operations before income tax. This definition is consistent across AIG’s modules (including geography). These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to AIG’s current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that AIG believes to be common to the industry. PTOI is a GAAP measure for our operating segments.  

 •   changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;  

 •   changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains and losses;  

 •   other income and expense — net, related to Legacy Portfolio run-off insurance lines;  

 •   loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;  

 •   net realized capital gains and losses;  

 •   non-qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital gains and losses;  

 •   income or loss from discontinued operations; 

 •   net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);  

 •   pension expense related to a one-time lump sum payment to former employees;  

 •   income and loss from divested businesses;  

 •   non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;  

 •   reserve development related to non-operating run-off insurance business; and  

 •   restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization. 

Ratios: AIG, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for Commercial Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. AIG’s ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.  

9  

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact in excess of $10 million each. Catastrophes also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. AIG believes the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of AIG’s underwriting results on an on-going basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. AIG also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.  

Underwriting ratios are computed as follows:  

   •   Loss ratio = Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred ÷ Net premiums earned (NPE)  

   •   Acquisition ratio = Total acquisition expenses ÷ NPE  

   •   General operating expense ratio = General operating expenses ÷ NPE  

   •   Expense ratio = Acquisition ratio + General operating expense ratio  

   •   Combined ratio = Loss ratio + Expense ratio  

   •   Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted (AYLR) = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – CATs – PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums (RIPs) related to catastrophes +/(-) RIPs related to prior year catastrophes + (Additional) returned premium related to PYD]  

   •   Accident year combined ratio = AYLR + Expense ratio  

   •   Catastrophe losses (CATs) and reinstatement premiums = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – (CATs)] ÷ [NPE +/(-) RIPs related to catastrophes] – Loss ratio  

   •   Prior year development net of premium adjustments = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – Prior year loss reserve development unfavorable (favorable) (PYD), net of reinsurance] ÷ [NPE +/(-) RIPs related to prior year catastrophes + (Additional) returned premium related to prior year development] – Loss ratio  

Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted (Adjusted for Prior Year Development) further adjusts the Accident Year Loss Ratio, as adjusted to include the impact of the prior year reserve development into each respective accident year.  

Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment type annuity contracts and mutual funds.  

Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.

Financial highlights - notes  

 (a) For the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, because we reported net losses and after-tax operating losses, and for the twelve months ended December, 31, 2016, because we reported a net loss, all common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive and are therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted shares and diluted per share amounts. We reported an after-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2016; therefore, we reported earnings per share on diluted basis. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the weighted average outstanding shares - diluted includes 30, 326,772 dilutive shares.  

 (b) Diluted shares in the diluted EPS calculation represent basic shares for the three-months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 due to the net losses in those periods.  

 (c) Computed as Annualized net income (loss) attributable to AIG divided by average AIG shareholders’ equity. Equity includes AOCI and DTA.  

 (d) Computed as Annualized After-tax Operating Income attributable to AIG divided by Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity.  

 (e) Represents total AIG shareholders’ equity divided by Total common shares outstanding.  

 (f) Represents total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, divided by Total common shares outstanding.  

 (g) Represents Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity, divided by Total common shares outstanding.  

 (h) Represents Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity, and including growth in quarterly dividends above $0.125 per share to shareholders, divided by Total common shares outstanding.
