“We are pleased with the sequential improvement in our sales performance and positive comparable sales for the quarter. Our top line progress is a direct reflection of sustained investment in the customer. Our stronger sales execution and improved availability enabled us to serve our customers better,” said Tom Greco, President and Chief Executive Officer. 

Greco continued, “Our bottom line in the quarter reflects a planned inventory reduction along with sustained investments in the customer to accelerate top line growth. Our first priority is to deliver an outstanding experience for our customers and deliver consistent top line performance. We fully expect to balance our top and bottom line performance over time as we offset investments with a robust productivity agenda.”

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Highlights

Total sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.4% to $2.08 billion, as compared with total sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 of $2.03 billion. The sales increase was driven by the comparable store sales growth of 3.1%, inclusive of the positive impact of the year-over-year comparable benefit from holiday timing and new store and Worldpac branch openings partially offset by the store closures and Carquest store consolidations. Total sales for fiscal 2016 were $9.57 billion compared to fiscal 2015 of $9.74 billion.

The Company's Gross Profit rate was 43.6% of sales during the fourth quarter as compared to 44.7% during the fourth quarter last year. The 114 basis-point decrease was primarily driven by previously capitalized supply chain costs flowing through the income statement and reducing gross profit as a result of the planned reduction of inventory levels. The Company's Gross Profit rate was 44.5% of sales for fiscal 2016 as compared to 45.4% for fiscal 2015.

On a GAAP basis, the Company's SG&A rate was 38.5% of sales during the fourth quarter as compared to 39.8% during the same period last year. The 128 basis-point decrease was primarily due to lower integration and restructuring related costs during the fourth quarter compared to last year. Excluding this impact, the Company's Adjusted SG&A rate was 37.5% of sales during the fourth quarter as compared to 37.0% during the same period last year. The 58 basis-point increase in Adjusted SG&A was primarily driven by ongoing customer focused investments. On a GAAP basis, the Company's SG&A rate was 36.3% of sales for fiscal 2016 as compared to 36.9% during the same period last year. The Company's Adjusted SG&A rate was 35.1% of sales during fiscal 2016 as compared to 35.2% during the same period last year. 

On a GAAP basis, the Company's Operating Income during the fourth quarter was $106.1 million, an increase of 5.4% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. On a GAAP basis, the Operating Income rate was 5.1% during the fourth quarter as compared to 5.0% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The Company's Adjusted Operating Income was $125.6 million during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 20.3% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As a percentage of sales, Adjusted Operating Income in the fourth quarter was 6.0% versus 7.7% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, the Company's GAAP Operating Income rate was 8.2% versus 8.5% during fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, the Company's Adjusted Operating Income was 9.4% versus 10.2% during fiscal 2015.

Operating cash flow decreased approximately 27.4% to $500.9 million in fiscal 2016 from $689.6 million in fiscal 2015. Free cash flow was $241.3 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $454.9 million in fiscal 2015. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 were $259.6 million as compared to $234.7 million in fiscal 2015.

Store Information

As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated 5,062 stores and 127 Worldpac branches and served approximately 1,250 independently owned Carquest stores. 

2017 Full Year Assumptions

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1.Comparable store sales estimate excludes sales to independently owned Carquest locations and includes the impact of Carquest store consolidations. 

2.Adjusted Operating Income excludes non-operational expenses related to the integration of General Parts ("Integration Expenses") and the recurring non-cash amortization of General Parts' intangible assets. Adjusted Operating Income is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes Adjusted Operating Income is an important measure in assessing the overall performance of the business and utilizes this metric in its ongoing reporting. On that basis, Management believes it is useful to provide Adjusted Operating Income to investors and prospective investors to evaluate Advance’s operating performance across periods adjusting for these items. Adjusted Operating Income might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted Operating Income should not be used by investors or third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions, as it excludes a number of important cash and non-cash recurring items. Please refer to a more detailed explanation of the Company's use of non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying financial tables where the Company provides a reconciliation of its 2016 and 2015 financial results reported on a GAAP basis to the adjusted basis. Because of the forward-looking nature of the 2017 non-GAAP financial measures, specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are not available at this time.

3. Income tax rate estimate does not factor in any impact from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 related to changes in the presentation of excess tax benefits (deficits) from share-based payment awards. The Company will adopt the provisions, as specified by the ASU, effective fiscal 2017. 

Dividend

On February 15, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share to be paid on April 7, 2017 to stockholders of record as of March 24, 2017.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company's financial results include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, the Company has presented these non-GAAP financial measures as management believes that the presentation of its financial results that exclude non-cash charges related to the acquired General Parts intangibles and non-operational expenses associated with i) the integration of General Parts, ii) store consolidation costs and iii) support center restructuring costs is useful and indicative of its base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size, nature and significance and relate to the integration of General Parts and store closure activity in excess of historical levels. These measures assist in comparing the Company's current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in the industry. The disclosure of these measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management’s compensation. Included below is a description of the expenses the Company has determined are not normal, recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate the Company’s business and the rationale for why providing these measures are useful to investors as a supplement to the GAAP measures.

General Parts Integration Expenses - As disclosed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company acquired General Parts International, Inc. (“General Parts”) for $2.08 billion on January 2, 2014 and is in the midst of a multi-year integration plan to integrate the operations of General Parts with Advance Auto Parts. This includes the integration of product brands and assortments, supply chain and information technology. The integration is being completed in phases and the nature and timing of expenses will vary from quarter to quarter over several years. The integration of product brands and assortments was primarily completed in 2015 and the focus has shifted to integrating the supply chain and information technology systems beginning in 2016. Due to the size of the acquisition, the Company considers these expenses to be outside of its base business. Therefore, the Company believes providing additional information in the form of non-GAAP measures that exclude these costs is beneficial to the users of its financial statements in evaluating the operating performance of the base business and its sustainability once the integration is completed.

Store Closure and Consolidation Expenses - Store consolidation expenses consist of expenses associated with the Company’s announced plans to (i) convert or consolidate the Carquest stores acquired from General Parts, (ii) close its Autopart International stores in Florida and (iii) close approximately 80 underperforming Advance Auto Parts stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The conversion and consolidation of the Carquest stores is a multi-year process that began in 2014. As of December 31, 2016, 615 Carquest stores acquired from General Parts had been consolidated or converted into existing Advance Auto Parts stores format. As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated 608 stores under the Carquest name. The closure of the 40 Autopart International stores in Florida, primarily in the first quarter of 2015, and closure of 80 underperforming Advance Auto Parts stores in the fourth quarter of 2015 significantly exceed the Company’s average store closure activity. While periodic store closures are common, these closures represent major programs outside of the Company’s typical market evaluation process. The Company also continues to have store closures that occur as part of its normal market evaluation process and has not excluded the expenses associated with these store closures in computing the Company’s non-GAAP measures. The Company believes it is useful to provide additional non-GAAP measures that exclude these costs to provide investors greater comparability of our base business and core operating performance.

Support Center Restructuring Expenses - The costs excluded for support center restructuring activities include costs associated with (i) closing the Company’s Minnesota office and relocating functions to existing offices, (ii) relocating functions within the Company’s Roanoke, VA office and Raleigh, NC office (formerly the headquarters for General Parts) and (iii) eliminating duplicative functions between these two offices. These actions are a direct 

consequence of the acquisition and integration of General Parts and therefore the Company does not consider these expenses to be normal, recurring, cash operating expenses necessary to operate its business. These actions were substantially completed as of the end of fiscal 2015 and the Company has had no material support center restructuring expenses following the end of fiscal 2015.

The Company has included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following tables.

NOTE: Management uses free cash flow as a measure of our liquidity and believes it is a useful indicator to stockholders of our ability to implement our growth strategies and service our debt. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, information contained in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

(a) The Company retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a reclassification of debt issuance costs from Other assets, net to Long-term debt.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NOTE: Management believes its Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDAR ratio (“leverage ratio”) is a key financial metric for debt securities, as reviewed by rating agencies, and believes its debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. The Company’s goal is to maintain a 2.5 times leverage ratio and investment grade rating. The Company's credit rating directly impacts the interest rates on borrowings under its existing credit facility and could impact the Company's ability to obtain additional funding. If the Company was unable to maintain its investment grade rating this could negatively impact future performance and limit growth opportunities. Similar measures are utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants and ratios contained in the Company's financing arrangements. The leverage ratio calculated by the Company is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a substitute for debt to net earnings, net earnings or debt as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company adjusts the calculation to remove rent expense and capitalize the Company’s existing operating leases to provide a more meaningful comparison with the Company’s peers and to account for differences in debt structures and leasing arrangements. The use of a multiple of rent expense to calculate the adjustment for capitalized operating lease obligations is a commonly used method of estimating the debt the Company would record for its leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or the Company had purchased the property. The Company’s calculation of its leverage ratio might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.

Store Information:

As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated 5,062 stores and 127 Worldpac branches and served approximately 1,250 independently owned Carquest stores. The below table summarizes the changes in the number of the company-operated stores and branches during the twelve and fifty-two weeks ended December 31, 2016.
