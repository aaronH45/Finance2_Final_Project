Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On January 18, 2017, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of The Williams Companies, Inc. (the “Company”) approved amendments to the Company’s By-laws to adopt proxy access.  

Article III, Section 3 of the By-laws, the proxy access by-law provision, permits a stockholder, or group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s annual meeting proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two nominees or 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and the director nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-laws. The amendments were effective upon approval, and proxy access will first be available in connection with annual meetings following the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  

The By-laws were also amended to make updates and minor conforming changes to the advance notice provisions in Article II, Section 10 and Article III, Section 1 of the By-laws, in light of the proxy access by-law, as well as other miscellaneous minor wording and technical amendments.  

The description of the amendments to the By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the By-laws as amended, attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
