Business Segments  

Electric Transmission & Distribution  

The electric transmission & distribution segment reported full-year 2016 operating income of $628 million, consisting of $537 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $91 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2015 was $607 million, consisting of $502 million from the TDU and $105 million related to securitization bonds.  

Full-year 2016 operating income for the TDU benefited from rate relief, customer growth with the addition of over 54,000 customers, as well as higher equity return, primarily due to true-up proceeds. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation, higher O&M expenses and lower right of way revenues.  

Natural Gas Distribution  

The natural gas distribution segment reported full-year 2016 operating income of $303 million compared with $273 million in 2015.  

Full-year 2016 operating income for natural gas distribution improved as a result of rate relief, lower bad debt expense and customer growth with the addition of more than 35,000 customers. This improvement was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization, increased labor and benefits expenses and increased contract services expenses.  

Energy Services  

The energy services segment reported full-year 2016 operating income of $20 million, which included a mark-to-market loss of $21 million, compared with $42 million in 2015, which included a mark-to-market gain of $4 million. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments, operating income was $41 million in 2016 and $38 million in 2015.  

Midstream Investments  

The midstream investments segment reported full-year 2016 equity income of $208 million, compared to a loss of $1,633 million in 2015, which included the impairment charges noted above. The impairments in 2015 were partially offset by full-year earnings of $213 million.  

Earnings Outlook  

CenterPoint Energy expects earnings on a guidance basis for 2017 in the range of $1.25 - $1.33 per diluted share. This guidance includes anticipated utility operations earnings of $0.93 - $0.97 per diluted share and anticipated midstream investment earnings of $0.31 - $0.37 per diluted share.

The utility operations guidance range considers performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates, and financing activities.  

In providing this guidance, the company uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not consider other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and the related stocks, or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company’s Energy Services business.  

In providing guidance for midstream investments, the company assumes a 54.1 percent limited partner ownership interest in Enable Midstream and includes the amortization of CenterPoint Energy’s basis differential in Enable Midstream. CenterPoint Energy’s guidance takes into account such factors as Enable Midstream’s most recent public outlook for 2017 dated Feb. 21, 2017, and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream’s unusual items.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by CenterPoint Energy in Providing Guidance  

In addition to presenting its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including presentation of net income and diluted earnings per share, CenterPoint Energy also provides guidance based on adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. CenterPoint Energy’s adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation excludes from net income and diluted earnings per share, respectively, the impact of ZENS and related securities, mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company’s Energy Services business and adjustments for impairment charges. CenterPoint Energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of ZENS and related securities, mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company’s Energy Services business and impairment charges are not estimable.  

Management evaluates the company’s financial performance in part based on adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of CenterPoint Energy’s overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods. The adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that Management believes does not most accurately reflect the company’s fundamental business performance. These excluded items are reflected in the reconciliation tables of this news release, where applicable. CenterPoint Energy’s adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income and diluted earnings per share, which respectively are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures also may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
