CEO Comments

Denise Morrison, Campbell’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “I am not satisfied with our sales performance this quarter. Declines were most prominent in Campbell Fresh driven by a market share decline and weather-related issues in carrots, capacity constraints from the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS recall last June, and Garden Fresh Gourmet. Although V8 shelf-stable beverages declined, I am encouraged by the positive momentum in our core U.S. soup, simple meals and Pepperidge Farm snacks businesses. U.S. soup sales increased in the quarter, driven by our ready-to-serve varieties, such as Chunky and new Well Yes!, which performed above expectations.

“C-Fresh performance was below our expectations. The new C-Fresh management team has conducted an extensive review of the business and has determined the recovery will take longer to execute than we originally planned. As a result, we no longer expect C-Fresh to grow this fiscal year. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in the growth potential of the packaged fresh category. C-Fresh continues to be an important strategic business for Campbell to meet growing consumer demand for fresh foods and interest in health and well-being.

“We continued to over-deliver on our cost savings initiative, and now expect to achieve our target a year ahead of schedule. We have increased our savings target from $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018 to $450 million by the end of fiscal 2020. Looking ahead, we expect to improve our sales performance in the back half and are maintaining our guidance for the fiscal year.”

Items Impacting Comparability

The company reported earnings of $0.33 per share in the quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and the Garden Fresh reporting unit as operating performance was well below expectations and the new leadership team of the Campbell Fresh division initiated a strategic review. This performance and review led to a revised outlook for future sales, earnings and cash flow. The current quarter results reflect a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $147 million, or $0.45 per share, to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit. The current quarter results also reflect a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $65 million, or $0.13 per share, to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets of the Garden

Fresh reporting unit. The prior-year quarter included pre-tax charges related to cost savings initiatives of $16 million, or $0.03 per share, and a pre-tax gain related to a pension benefit mark-to-market adjustment of $7 million, or $0.01 per share. Excluding items impacting comparability in both periods, adjusted EPS increased 5 percent to $0.91 per share, compared with $0.87 per share in the year-ago quarter. A detailed reconciliation of the reported (GAAP) financial information to the adjusted information is included at the end of this news release. 

Second-Quarter Results 

Sales decreased 1 percent to $2.171 billion driven by the decline in organic sales, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. Organic sales decreased 2 percent driven by lower volume and higher promotional spending. 

Gross margin increased from 37.2 percent to 38.0 percent. Excluding items impacting comparability in the prior year, adjusted gross margin improved 0.7 percentage points. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by productivity improvements and the benefits from cost savings initiatives, partly offset by higher supply chain costs and inflation, as well as higher promotional spending. The adjusted gross margin increase reflects the continued gross margin expansion in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. The increase in supply chain costs was primarily driven by higher carrot costs in the quarter due to the adverse impact on crop yields of heavy rains in December and January.

Marketing and selling expenses increased 6 percent to $237 million. Excluding items impacting comparability in the prior year, adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 5 percent primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses. Administrative expenses decreased 5 percent to $139 million. Excluding items impacting comparability in the prior year, adjusted administrative expenses decreased 3 percent primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs compared to the prior year, partly offset by higher benefit-related costs and investments in long-term innovation.

EBIT decreased 50 percent to $205 million, principally driven by the impairment charges in the current-year quarter. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EBIT decreased 1 percent to $417 million reflecting lower sales and higher marketing and selling expenses, partly offset by a higher adjusted gross margin percentage.

3

Net interest expense increased 4 percent to $28 million reflecting higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio, partly offset by lower levels of debt. The tax rate increased to 42.9 percent as compared with a tax rate of 31.5 percent in the prior year. Excluding items impacting comparability, the adjusted tax rate decreased 3.8 percentage points to 27.8 percent as the timing of tax expense on an adjusted basis was favorably impacted by the goodwill impairment. The outlook for the full-year adjusted tax rate remains unchanged and is expected to be approximately 32 percent. 

First-Half Results 

Sales decreased 1 percent to $4.373 billion driven by a 1 percent decline in organic sales, partly offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.

EBIT decreased 9 percent to $662 million. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EBIT was comparable to the prior year at $905 million reflecting a higher adjusted gross margin percentage and lower administrative expenses, offset by higher marketing and selling expenses and volume declines. 

Net interest expense increased 2 percent to $56 million reflecting higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio, partly offset by lower levels of debt. The tax rate increased 3.2 percentage points to 35.1 percent. Excluding items impacting comparability, the adjusted tax rate decreased 2.7 percentage points to 30.2 percent. 

Cash flow from operations decreased to $667 million from $754 million a year ago primarily due to changes in accrued liabilities, principally accrued taxes and accrued incentive compensation.

Cost Savings Program

In fiscal 2015, Campbell launched a comprehensive reorganization and multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $300 million by fiscal 2018. Campbell now expects to achieve $300 million in cost savings by the end of fiscal 2017, a year earlier than anticipated. Based on the success of the program to date and the identification of additional savings opportunities, the savings target is being increased from $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018 to $450 million by the end of fiscal 2020. 

4

Fiscal 2017 Guidance 

Campbell continues to expect sales to increase by 0 to 1 percent, adjusted EBIT to increase by 1 to 4 percent, and adjusted EPS to increase by 2 to 5 percent, or $3.00 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes the impact from currency translation will be nominal. A non-GAAP reconciliation is not provided for 2017 guidance since certain items are not estimable, such as pension and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments, and these items are not considered to be part of the company's ongoing business results.

Americas Simple Meals and Beverages

Sales in the quarter were comparable to the prior year at $1.231 billion. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, segment sales decreased 1 percent driven by declines in V8 beverages, partly offset by gains in soup, Prego pasta sauces and Plum products. Sales of U.S. soup increased 1 percent driven by gains in ready-to-serve soups, mostly offset by declines in broth and condensed soups. 

Segment operating earnings increased 8 percent to $313 million. The increase was driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partly offset by increased advertising and consumer promotion expenses.

Global Biscuits and Snacks 

Sales in the quarter were comparable to the prior year at $680 million. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, segment sales decreased 1 percent primarily driven by declines in Kelsen, primarily in the U.S., and Arnott’s biscuits, partly offset by gains in Pepperidge Farm. Pepperidge Farm sales increased due to gains in Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies, partly offset by declines in fresh bakery and frozen products.

Segment operating earnings decreased 4 percent to $135 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage. 

Campbell Fresh

Sales in the quarter decreased 8 percent to $260 million driven by lower sales of carrots, Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages, and Garden Fresh Gourmet, partly offset by gains in refrigerated soup.

Segment operating earnings decreased from $21 million to a loss of $3 million reflecting increased carrot costs due to the adverse impact on crop yields of heavy rains in December and January, as well as the cost impact of lower beverage operating efficiency and lower sales. 

Unallocated Corporate Expenses

Unallocated corporate expenses for the quarter were $241 million compared to $29 million in the prior year. The current-year quarter included the pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Second Quarter Ended January 29, 2017

Campbell Soup Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in certain communications. These non-GAAP financial measures are measures of performance not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, GAAP reported measures. Management believes that also presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of the company's historical operating results and trends in its underlying operating results, and provides transparency on how the company evaluates its business. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. 

Organic Net Sales

Organic net sales are net sales excluding the impact of currency. Management believes that excluding this item, which is not part of the ongoing business, improves the comparability of year-to-year results. A reconciliation of net sales as reported to organic net sales follows.

Items Impacting Gross Margin, Costs and Expenses, and Earnings
