Explanatory Note.

On April 27, 2016, The Hershey Company (the “Company”) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the “Initial Form 8‑K”) disclosing that on April 21, 2016, the Company, upon the approval of the Audit Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Company, notified KPMG, LLP (“KPMG”), the Company’s then-current independent registered public accounting firm, that it would be dismissed from that position effective upon completion of KPMG’s audits of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 (and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016), and the issuance of their report thereon. On June 17, 2016, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing that on June 15, 2016, the Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the Company’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. This Amendment No. 1 to the Initial Form 8-K is being filed to disclose the specific date of KPMG’s dismissal and to update the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K through that date.

Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant.

KPMG served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm until February 21, 2017, the date on which KPMG issued its report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 (and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016).

The audit reports of KPMG on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The audit reports of KPMG on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except that KPMG’s report indicates that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, because of the effect of a material weakness related to the Company’s accounting for cocoa derivative instruments. During the Company’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the interim period through February 21, 2017, there were no (1) disagreements with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports; and (2) events of the type listed in paragraphs (A) through (D) of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, except for the material weakness as described in this paragraph.

The Company provided KPMG with a copy of this Amendment No. 1 to the Initial Form 8-K prior to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and requested that KPMG furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not KPMG agrees with the above statements. The letter from KPMG is filed with this Amendment No. 1 to the Initial Form 8-K as Exhibit 16.1.
