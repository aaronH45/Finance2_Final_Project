Unum Group Reports Fourth Quarter 2016 Results

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (February 1, 2017) - Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported net income of $248.0 million ($1.07 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to net income of $226.1 million ($0.93 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

After-tax operating income, which excludes after-tax realized investment gains and losses on the Company’s investment portfolio and the amortization of prior period actuarial losses on the Company’s pension plans, was $232.4 million ($1.00 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $230.6 million ($0.95 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2015. The combined impact of the amounts excluded for the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015 equaled net after-tax income of $15.6 million ($0.07 per diluted common share) and a net after-tax loss of $4.5 million ($0.02 per diluted common share), respectively.

“We achieved record net income in 2016, ending the year with very strong fourth quarter results,” said Richard P. McKenney, president and chief executive officer. “Our performance continues to be anchored by market-leading positions in employee benefits which drives solid premium growth in our core business operations and strong profits. 2016 was a year that saw us deliver a combination of growth, disciplined execution, and return of capital to our shareholders. We are well positioned strategically and financially to carry this momentum into 2017.”

RESULTS BY SEGMENT

We measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "operating income" or "operating loss", which differ from income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and non-operating retirement-related gains or losses. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for income before income tax or net income. 

Unum US Segment 

 Unum US reported operating income of $240.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 12.1 percent from $214.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Premium income for the segment increased 5.9 percent to $1,325.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to premium income of $1,251.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Net investment income for the segment was $206.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $220.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported a 35.4 percent increase in operating income to $89.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $66.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Premium income in group disability increased 3.7 percent to $591.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $570.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to an increase in the in-force block due to sales growth and a continued strong level of persistency. Net investment income declined by 4.7 percent to $118.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $124.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decline in yields and lower miscellaneous investment income. The benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 77.7 percent, compared to 81.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. This improvement was due primarily to lower claim incidence rates, favorable claim recovery experience, and the impact of rate increases on the in-force block for our group long-term disability product line, which more than offset a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for new claim incurrals for the group long-term disability line of business implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016. Group long-term disability sales declined by 7.3 percent to $107.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $116.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Group short-term disability sales increased 28.5 percent to $61.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $48.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 91.0 percent for full year 2016, compared to 92.1 percent for full year 2015. Persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 87.7 percent for full year 2016, compared to 88.1 percent for full year 2015. 

The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported operating income of $56.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 3.3 percent from $54.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Premium income for this line of business increased 4.9 percent to $391.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $373.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to growth in the in-force block resulting from sales growth and improved persistency. Net investment income declined 15.7 percent to $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $33.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to a

decline in the level of invested assets supporting this line of business. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 71.5 percent, compared to 72.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting lower incidence and a lower average claim size in the group life line as well as favorable experience under group life waiver of premium benefits. Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products increased 14.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $142.9 million, compared to $124.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Persistency in the group life line of business was 90.7 percent for full year 2016, compared to 89.2 percent for full year 2015. 

The supplemental and voluntary line of business reported an increase of 0.7 percent in operating income to $94.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $93.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Premium income for supplemental and voluntary increased 11.1 percent to $341.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $307.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, driven by the addition of the dental and vision product offering resulting from an acquisition in August 2016, as well as growth in the in-force block of individual disability and voluntary benefits products due to sales growth and favorable persistency. Somewhat offsetting this growth was the impact of a reinsurance transaction executed in the fourth quarter of 2016 to cede a portion of the individual disability product line. Net investment income declined to $59.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $62.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, due to lower miscellaneous income and a decline in portfolio yields which offset an increase in the level of invested assets. The benefit ratio for the individual disability product line was 54.7 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016, generally consistent with 54.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2015. The benefit ratio for voluntary benefits was 44.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 48.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. The benefit ratio for dental and vision was 65.9 percent. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2015, sales in the individual disability product line declined 17.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $17.4 million. Sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $45.4 million. Sales in the dental and vision product line totaled $10.0 million. Persistency in the individual disability product line was 91.1 percent for full year 2016, compared to 90.3 percent for full year 2015. Persistency in the voluntary benefits product line was 76.9 percent for full year 2016, compared to 75.9 percent for full year 2015. Persistency for dental and vision was 84.6 percent at year end 2016. 

Unum UK Segment

Unum UK reported operating income of $29.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of 19.2 percent from $37.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In local currency, operating income declined by 1.2 percent to £24.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to £24.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Premium income declined by 18.9 percent to $121.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $150.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In local currency, premium income was £98.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of 0.9 percent from £99.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily resulting from a lack of growth in the in-force business. Net investment income declined by 17.2 percent to $28.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $34.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In local currency, net

investment income increased 1.3 percent to £23.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to £22.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 67.6 percent, compared to 69.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to a lower average size of new claims in the group life business. 

Sales declined by 12.9 percent to $23.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $27.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In local currency, sales for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 6.7 percent to £19.1 million. Persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 89.5 percent for full year 2016 compared to 89.2 percent for full year 2015. Persistency in the group life line of business was 81.3 percent for full year 2016, compared to 80.0 percent for full year 2015. 

Colonial Life Segment 

Colonial Life reported a 3.0 percent increase in operating income to $79.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $77.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Premium income for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 6.8 percent to $360.4 million, compared to $337.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to sales growth and favorable persistency. Net investment income totaled $35.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $35.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 51.4 percent, compared to 51.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Sales increased 6.5 percent to $181.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 from $169.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Persistency in Colonial Life was 79.3 percent for full year 2016 compared to 78.5 percent for full year 2015. 

Closed Block Segment

The Closed Block segment reported operating income of $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to operating income of $28.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Premium income for this segment declined 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due to expected policy terminations and maturities in the individual disability line of business which was partially offset by an increase in premium income for the long-term care line of business resulting from premium rate increases on certain in-force policies less the impact of policy terminations. Net investment income increased 0.9 percent to $343.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $340.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to an increase in the level of invested assets. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability line of business declined to 84.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 87.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to a fourth quarter of 2015 reduction in the claim reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher than normal level of bond tenders and calls, which did not occur to the same degree in the fourth quarter of 2016. Underlying risk experience in this line was generally consistent year over year. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 89.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 89.7 percent

in the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to favorable mortality experience and the impact of persistency on active life reserves. 

Corporate Segment 

The Corporate segment reported an operating loss of $37.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to an operating loss of $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The higher operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 was due primarily to lower net investment income and higher operating expenses.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure of "after-tax operating income" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and non-operating retirement-related gains or losses as specified in the reconciliations below. We believe operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business. 

Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses. Although we may experience realized investment gains or

losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities. 

The amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses, a component of the net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans, is driven by market performance as well as plan amendments and is not indicative of the operational results of our businesses. We believe that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses from operating income or loss provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of our operating results. Although we manage our non-operating retirement-related gains or losses separately from the operational performance of our business, these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of our company and have historically increased or decreased over time, depending on plan amendments and market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans.

We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability. 

Information reconciling the Company’s outlook on after-tax operating income growth per share to the comparable GAAP financial measure is not provided. The only amounts excluded from after-tax operating income are those described in the preceding paragraphs. While the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses in our net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans is generally consistent in a given annual period and can reasonably be predicted, the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty realized investment gains and losses, which are affected by overall market conditions and also by factors such as an economic or political change in the country of the issuer, a regulatory change pertaining to the issuer’s industry, a significant improvement or deterioration in the cash flows of the issuer, unforeseen accounting irregularities or fraud committed by an issuer, movement in credit spreads, ratings upgrades or downgrades, a change in the issuer’s marketplace or business prospects, or any other event that significantly affects the issuers of the fixed maturity securities which the Company holds in its investment portfolio.
