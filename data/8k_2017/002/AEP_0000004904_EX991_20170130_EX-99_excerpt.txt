NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are based on the Company’s historical consolidated financial statements as adjusted to give effect to the sale of the Disposition Plants. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 depicts the impact of the sale as if it had occurred on September 30, 2016. The unaudited pro forma statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 depict the pro forma impact of the sale of the Disposition Plants as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial statements have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of future results of operations or financial condition. In the Company’s pro forma income statements and balance sheet, the “Pro Forma AEP” column represents the Company’s remaining operations following the sale of the Disposition Plants. 

2. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

The following adjustments for the unaudited pro forma income statements and balance sheet reflect the impact of the Company’s sale of the Disposition Plants on previously filed income statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 

Pro Forma Financial Statement Adjustments

The following income statement adjustments generally relate to the Company’s sale of the Disposition Plants. 

(a)Reflects the elimination of revenues associated with the activities of the Disposition Plants.

(b)Reflects the elimination of operating expenses associated with the activities of the Disposition Plants.

(c)Reflects a reclassification of the amortization of the capacity deferrals discussed in (g) below. The total amortization was $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

(d)Reflects the elimination of Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction associated with the activities of the Lawrenceburg Plant.

(e)Reflects the interest costs that would not have been incurred if the Company had the proceeds from the sale of the Disposition Plants at the beginning of the period.

(f)Reflects the elimination of income tax expense, calculated at the estimated statutory rate of 38%, associated with the activities of the Disposition Plants.

(g)Through May 2015, the Company deferred a portion of its incurred capacity costs not recovered from Competitive Retail Electric Suppliers in Ohio. For Historical AEP presentation purposes, a total of $12 million of incurred capacity costs was deferred in various operating expense income statement line items. As a result of the sale of the Disposition Plants, a portion of the deferral from January 2015 through May 2015 would have been attributable to the non-affiliated capacity purchases made to meet the Company’s obligations to Ohio Power Company (OPCo), a wholly-owned electric subsidiary of the Company. As such, a proforma adjustment is reflected to reclassify the deferral of incurred capacity costs applicable to the Disposition Plants from various operating expense line items to Purchased Electricity for Resale.

(h)Reflects capacity purchases of $150 million required by the Company to fulfill the capacity needs of OPCo’s retail load from January 1, 2015 through May 31, 2015 as required by the Power Supply Agreement between AGR and OPCo. The Power Supply Agreement ended May 31, 2015. 

The following balance sheet adjustments generally relate to the Company’s sale of the Disposition Plants.

(a)Reflects the receipt of cash proceeds of $2.1 billion from the sale of the Disposition Plants, net of transaction related costs, taxes and the retirement of Lawrenceburg Plant long-term debt totaling approximately $700 million. The Company expects to use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to reduce an additional $234 million of outstanding long-term debt. 

(b)Reflects the elimination of the assets of the Disposition Plants. 

6

(c)Reflects the elimination of the liabilities of the Disposition Plants. 

(d)Reflects the elimination of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the sale of the Disposition Plants.

(e)Reflects the estimated $130 million after tax gain arising from the sale of the Disposition Plants. The estimated gain has not been reflected in the pro forma consolidated statements of income as it is considered nonrecurring in nature.
