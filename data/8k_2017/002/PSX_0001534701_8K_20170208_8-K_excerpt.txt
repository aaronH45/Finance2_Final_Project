Item 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year

On February 8, 2017, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Phillips 66 (the “Company”) adopted Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company (as so amended and restated, the “By-laws”), which took effect immediately. The By-laws supersede the previously existing Amended and Restated By-laws, which were effective on April 30, 2012.

The By-laws were amended to incorporate a “proxy access” by-law. Under Section 10A of Article II of the By-laws, a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, that has continuously owned at least three percent (3%) of the outstanding capital stock of the Company for three years, may nominate and include in the Company’s annual meeting proxy materials a number of director nominees not to exceed the greater of two or 20% of the number of the Company’s directors then serving on the Board (rounded down to the nearest whole number), provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-laws. Such nominations are subject to additional eligibility, procedural and disclosure requirements set forth in the By-laws, including the requirement that the Company must receive notice of such nominations not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders.

The By-laws were also revised to include some conforming and clarifying changes.

The description of the amendments to the By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-laws, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
