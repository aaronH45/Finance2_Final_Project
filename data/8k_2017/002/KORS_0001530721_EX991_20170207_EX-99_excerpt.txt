London — February 7, 2017 — Michael Kors Holdings Limited (NYSE:KORS) (the “Company”), a global luxury lifestyle brand, today announced its financial results for the fiscal 2017 third quarter ended December 31, 2016.

For the third quarter ended December 31, 2016:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

John D. Idol, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “During the quarter, we delivered earnings per share results that were in line with our expectations and we continued to focus on our growth pillars, which are centered on consistently delivering innovative fashion products for our customers and enhancing consumer engagement with the Michael Kors brand worldwide. We were pleased with the response to our new Fall and holiday handbag collections as well as the launches of our Michael Kors ACCESS line of wearable technology and our new Wonderlust fragrance. We also saw great consumer response to our new digital flagships in Europe, and are excited to further expand our omni-channel presence as we deepen our relationship with consumers globally. In addition, we continued our expansion in Asia, which we believe represents a $1 billion opportunity over the long term. Overall, we were disappointed with our North American and European comparable store sales performance during the quarter. We believe that headwinds in these markets will continue throughout the Spring season as we face reduced traffic trends in shopping malls, currency fluctuation, uncertainty surrounding certain political changes in European countries and the implementation of our reduced promotional cadence in North America. While we face certain challenges in the short term, we continue to believe that there is meaningful long-term growth ahead for the company as we focus on maintaining our luxury leadership position while expanding the Michael Kors brand internationally.”

Share Repurchase Program

During the third quarter, the Company repurchased 2,069,706 of the Company's ordinary shares for approximately $100.0 million in open market transactions. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining availability under the Company’s share repurchase program was $250.0 million. Share repurchases may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, trading restrictions under the Company’s insider trading policy, and other relevant factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Balance Sheet

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $147.8 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. This debt consisted of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The amount available for future borrowings is approximately $852.7 million. In January 2017, the Company repaid all of the borrowings outstanding under the 2015 Credit Facility. 

Outlook

For fiscal 2017, the Company now expects total revenue to be approximately $4.48 billion and for comparable sales to decrease in the high-single digit range. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 19.9% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $11.3 million in one-time acquisition related costs, and approximately 19.7% on a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned one-time costs. For fiscal 2017, diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.19 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time costs, and $4.09 to $4.13 on a GAAP basis, including the one-time costs. This assumes 169.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding and a tax rate of approximately 21%.

The Company expects operating margin to be approximately 14.0%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.72 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This assumes 164.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding and a tax rate of approximately 22%.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Constant currency effects are non-GAAP financial measures, which are provided to supplement our reported operating results to facilitate comparisons of our operating results and trends in our business, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Because we are a global Company, foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant effect on our reported results. We calculate constant currency measures and the related foreign currency impacts by translating the current-year’s reported amounts into comparable amounts using prior year’s foreign exchange rates for each currency. All constant currency performance measures discussed below should be considered a supplement to and not in lieu of our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).

Additionally, this earnings release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures relating to certain one-time costs associated with the acquisition of the Greater China licensee. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, among other things, to evaluate its operating performance and in order to represent the manner in which the Company conducts and views its business. The Company believes that excluding non-recurring items helps its management and investors compare operating performance based on its ongoing operations. While the Company considers the non-GAAP measures to be useful supplemental measures in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, nor act as a substitute for, any amounts presented in its consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies.
