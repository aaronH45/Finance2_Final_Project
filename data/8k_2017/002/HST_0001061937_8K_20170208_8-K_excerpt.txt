On February 8, 2017, Mr. Terence Golden expressed his intention not to stand for re-election to the Board of Directors of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (the “Company”) at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company and his term will therefore end at the conclusion of the 2017 Annual Meeting. Mr. Golden’s retirement comes after over 20 years of distinguished service to the Company. Mr. Golden served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1995 until his retirement in 2000 and he has also been a director of the Company since 1995. Mr. Golden confirmed to the Board that his determination to not stand for re-election is not the result of any disagreement with the Company relating to its operations, policies or practices. The Board also determined that, effective at the conclusion of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the size of the Board shall be decreased from ten to nine directors.
