DUBLIN, February 28, 2017 -- Endo International plc (NASDAQ/TSX: ENDP) today reported fourth-quarter 2016 financial results, including:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

“After I was named CEO last September, Endo began a comprehensive strategic review that has resulted in a series of definitive actions. First, we streamlined our global supply chain and restructured our Pain franchise, including the divestiture of BELBUCATM. We then executed a Corporate restructuring and have begun divesting non-core businesses with today's announced sale of Litha Healthcare Group. All of these

measures better position Endo to focus on its core assets, drive margin expansion and de-lever over a period of time," said Paul Campanelli, President and CEO of Endo.

"Endo's core assets include a Generics business, which is the fourth largest in the U.S. based on sales, that possesses a growing sterile injectables portfolio and a promising ANDA pipeline. Complementing our generics unit is a revamped specialty Branded business focusing on our flagship product XIAFLEX®. Despite industry headwinds and other challenges, we are excited about our future and have the people, products, and pipeline in place that we believe will enable us, in time, to create value for our shareholders," Mr. Campanelli concluded.

Blaise Coleman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, "Expected 2017 revenues of between $3.45 billion and $3.60 billion are forecasted to be lower than 2016 revenues primarily due to the expected revenue decline in our Generics base business and legacy Branded pain franchise, as well as the impact of divestitures and product discontinuations. We estimate 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of between $1.50 billion and $1.58 billion due, in part, to cost reduction initiatives undertaken in 2016 and early 2017 that have resulted in a significant year-over-year increase in Endo's adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of revenue. Finally, estimated 2017 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of between $3.45 and $3.75 is significantly impacted by a higher adjusted effective tax rate and an anticipated increase in variable-rate interest expense."

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Total revenues increased by 16 percent to $1,242 million in fourth-quarter 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to the launch of key first-to-file generic products, quetiapine and ezetimibe. GAAP net loss from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2016 was $3,333 million compared to GAAP net income from continuing operations of $444 million during the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to the amount of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fourth-quarter 2016. GAAP net loss per share from continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $14.96, compared to GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of $1.97 in fourth-quarter 2015.

Adjusted net income from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2016 increased by 29 percent to $396 million compared to fourth-quarter 2015, driven primarily by the contribution of quetiapine and ezetimibe. Adjusted net income per share from continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased 30 percent to $1.77 compared to fourth-quarter 2015.

U.S. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS

During fourth-quarter 2016, the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals business unit completed the restructuring of its product portfolio as well as its manufacturing facility network, including the divestiture of the Charlotte, North Carolina facility.

Fourth-quarter 2016 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals results include:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

U.S. BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

During fourth-quarter 2016, Endo announced highly statistically significant Phase 2b study results on the primary composite endpoint and all secondary endpoints for XIAFLEX® in patients with cellulite. The Company also announced its intention to return the BELBUCA™ (buprenorphine) buccal film product to its developer, eliminate its U.S. Branded pain sales field force and manage the Company's legacy pain portfolio as mature brands. Endo's U.S. Branded segment will now focus on its core Specialty products, including its flagship product XIAFLEX®, as well as SUPPRELIN® LA, TESTOPEL®, and AVEED®.

Fourth-quarter 2016 U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals results include:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•In January 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that it will hold an advisory committee meeting in March 2017 to discuss certain pre- and post-marketing data relating to OPANA® ER, and the overall risk-benefit of that product. The advisory committees will also discuss generic oxymorphone extended-release and oxymorphone immediate-release products.

INTERNATIONAL PHARMACEUTICALS

As with Endo's U.S. businesses, International Pharmaceuticals underwent a product-by-product and business-by-business assessment. Today, the Company announced the divestiture of Litha Healthcare Group to Acino for approximately $100 million. As part of Endo's strategic assessment and comprehensive asset review, the Company determined that Litha no longer aligned with its strategy and was not considered a core asset. The divestiture of Litha helps simplify the Endo organization and permits it to better focus on the core Generics and Specialty Branded Pharmaceutical businesses. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017, subject to customary conditions, including the expiration or termination of any waiting periods under applicable competition laws. The final purchase price will be subject to cash, debt, working capital and other potential contractual adjustments.

Endo's International Pharmaceuticals unit continued to effectively manage its business operations in anticipation of the impact of the loss-of-exclusivity for certain Paladin products, during the fourth-quarter 2016, while continuing its efforts to improve adjusted operating margins.

2017 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE

For the full twelve months ended December 31, 2017, at current exchange rates, Endo is providing guidance on revenue, GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS guidance from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. The Company estimates:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company’s 2017 non-GAAP financial guidance is based on the following assumptions:

•Adjusted gross margin of approximately 62.0% to 63.0%;

•Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 22.5% to 23.0%;

•Adjusted interest expense of approximately $470 million to $480 million;

•Adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 13.0% to 14.0%;

•Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations assumes full-year adjusted diluted shares outstanding of approximately 224 million shares; and

5

•Adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-09 ("ASU 2016-09") in the first quarter of 2017, changing the GAAP reporting of excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with employee stock-based compensation. The Company estimates there could be at least a $10 million tax detriment (~$0.04 GAAP and Adjusted diluted earnings per share estimated impact) recognized primarily in the first quarter of 2017 when most employee stock awards vest or expire during the year.

BALANCE SHEET, LIQUIDITY AND OTHER UPDATES

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $517.3 million in unrestricted cash; net debt of approximately $7.8 billion and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.6.

Fourth-quarter 2016 cash provided by operating activities was $81.1 million, primarily attributable to the benefit of no interest payments related to high-yield notes and lower mesh payments during the quarter, offset partially by increases in working capital resulting from the fourth-quarter quetiapine and ezetimibe launches in our generics segment.

During fourth-quarter 2016, the Company conducted an annual goodwill impairment assessment, resulting in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $2,674 million, including the following items:

•$2,342.5 million related to the Generics reporting unit, which represents the difference between the estimated implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and its book value. The impairment charge was driven by a reduction in the expected future cash flows in the Generics reporting unit primarily due to a change in pricing expectations partly driven by an expected increased level of competition and increased buying power from the continued consolidation of the generic business customer base. These charges are primarily due to industry and competitive pressures in the sector, which resulted in a reduction of the Generics reporting unit's fair value.

•$272.6 million related to the Paladin Canada reporting unit, was driven primarily by a reduction in pricing expectations and additional generic competitors for several of Paladin's products.

•$33.0 million and $26.3 million related to the Somar and Litha reporting units, respectively. 

In addition to the Company's goodwill assessment, the Company also incurred pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges in the fourth-quarter of approximately $830.3 million, including:

•$507.2 million and $285.5 million in our U.S. Generic Pharmaceutical and International Pharmaceutical segments, respectively, resulting from certain market conditions impacting the commercial potential of definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

6

•$37.6 million in the U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segment primarily resulting from the termination of BELBUCATM and the return of this product to BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(14)During the third quarter of 2016, Endo completed a legal entity reorganization that moved the Generics business to a new U.S. holding company structure that is separate from the legacy Branded business structure. The reorganization also provides operating flexibility and benefits and reduces the potential impact related to any future limits that could apply to the use of tax attributes by utilizing most of the Company’s attributes to offset the gain in the intercompany sale that stepped-up the tax basis of the U.S. Generics business assets. The utilization of acquired attributes in the reorganization would have had an unfavorable impact of $157 million on our full-year 2016 adjusted tax expense under Endo’s non-GAAP policy prior to the adoption of the SEC’s updated guidance on Non-GAAP measures (see below). The elimination of this acquired attribute benefit was largely offset by an improved mix of jurisdictional adjusted pre-tax income resulting primarily from the reorganization. The reorganization also gave rise to a discrete GAAP tax benefit of $636 million arising from outside basis differences. This benefit has been excluded from our adjusted effective tax rate in accordance with our policy.

Separately, as a result of the SEC’s updated guidance on Non-GAAP measures issued in May 2016, Endo is no longer excluding the non-cash deferred tax expense associated with acquired attributes in our adjusted income tax expense. This change has no impact on Endo’s historic or forward looking GAAP tax or cash tax profile. The following table presents the impact of our change in policy as of the second quarter of 2016 on Adjusted Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations for each relevant period of 2015 and 2016:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company utilizes certain financial measures that are not prescribed by or prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These Non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted earnings per share amounts. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that these are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These Non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. See Endo's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an explanation of Endo's non-GAAP financial measures.

This press release contains forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the statements by Messrs. Campanelli and Coleman, as well as, other statements regarding product development, market potential, corporate strategy, optimization efforts and restructurings, expected growth and regulatory approvals, together with Endo’s earnings per share amounts, product net sales, revenue forecasts and any other statements that refer to Endo’s expected, estimated or anticipated future results. Because forecasts are inherently estimates that cannot be made with precision, Endo’s performance at times differs materially from its estimates and targets, and Endo often does not know what the actual results will be until after the end of the applicable reporting period. Therefore, Endo will not report or comment on its progress during a current quarter except through public announcement. Any statement made by others with respect to progress during a current quarter cannot be attributed to Endo.

All forward-looking statements in this press release reflect Endo’s current analysis of existing trends and information and represent Endo’s judgment only as of the date of this press release. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Endo’s businesses, including, among other things, the following: changing competitive, market and regulatory conditions; Endo’s ability to obtain and maintain adequate protection for its intellectual property rights; the timing and uncertainty of the results of both the research and development and regulatory processes; domestic and foreign health care and cost containment reforms, including government pricing, tax and reimbursement policies; technological advances and patents obtained by competitors; the performance, including the approval, introduction, and consumer and physician acceptance of new products and the continuing acceptance of currently marketed products; the effectiveness of advertising and other promotional campaigns; the timely and successful implementation of strategic initiatives; the results of any pending or future litigation, investigations or claims; the uncertainty associated with the identification of and successful consummation and execution of external corporate development initiatives and strategic partnering transactions; and Endo’s ability to obtain and successfully maintain a sufficient supply of products to meet market demand in a timely manner. In addition, U.S. and international economic conditions, including higher unemployment, political instability, financial hardship, consumer confidence and debt levels, taxation, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, international relations, capital and credit availability, the status of financial markets and institutions, fluctuations or devaluations in the value of sovereign government debt, as well as the general impact of continued economic volatility, can materially affect Endo’s results. Therefore, the reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Endo expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required to do so by law.
