Corning Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Financial Results and Significant Progress on Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework 

Record Corning® Gorilla® Glass volume and accelerating Optical Communications growth provide momentum for 2017 

CORNING, N.Y. — Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) today announced results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2016. 

News Summary: 

  ·   Fourth-quarter results provided a strong finish to 2016: Q4 GAAP EPS of $1.47, up 765%, and core EPS of $.50, up 47%, year over year; Q4 GAAP and core sales up 11% and 6% respectively, year over year     

  ·   Business segment performance highlights included record Corning® Gorilla® Glass volume, driven by rapid adoption of Gorilla® Glass 5; acceleration of Optical Communications growth; and continued moderation in price declines in Display Technologies     

  ·   Significant progress since introducing the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, returning $6 billion to shareholders and advancing focused portfolio initiatives     

  ·   Year-over-year sales, net income, and EPS growth expected in the first quarter of 2017     

"Corning delivered outstanding fourth-quarter results, continuing the momentum that began earlier in the year," said Wendell P. Weeks, chairman, chief executive officer and president. "Our very strong finish to the year was highlighted by year-over-year core sales growth of 6%, core earnings growth of 24% and core EPS growth of 47%. We are encouraged by this strength, and expect growth in these year-over-year measures in the first quarter of 2017." 

Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework Progress 

Corning's Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework outlines the company's 2016-2019 leadership priorities. Under the Framework, Corning plans to deliver more than $12.5 billion to shareholders while investing $10 billion in growth opportunities. 

Since the Framework was announced, the company has achieved key milestones including the return of $6 billion to shareholders by increasing the dividend 12.5% and repurchasing 22% of its outstanding shares; and completing the realignment of Dow Corning Corporation, which unlocked tremendous value for shareholders. 

"As we enter the second year under our Framework, the strategic and financial benefits of Corning's focused portfolio are even more apparent," said Weeks. "We're particularly pleased to see our market-access platforms continue to evolve as we anticipated. Progress on our initiatives include the rapid adoption rate of Gorilla® Glass 5; new platform wins from major OEMs for gas particulate filters; and customer commitments that support long-term growth opportunities in Optical Communications. The strong response to our cutting-edge glass innovations at the recent Consumer Electronics Show is yet another illustration."

"In 2017, we will continue to advance the objectives of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework," Weeks added. "We expect to increase the value of Corning products used on mobile devices, accelerate growth in Optical Communications, commercialize gas particulate filters, and make advancements in pharmaceutical glass and Gorilla Glass for Automotive. Corning's focused portfolio positions the company well for the long-term." 

Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Results and Comparisons 

(In millions, except per-share amounts) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

*Core performance measures are non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided in the tables following this news release, as well as on the company's website. Core performance metrics (non-GAAP) are adjusted to exclude the impact of changes in Japanese yen and Korean won foreign exchange rates, as well as other items that do not reflect ongoing operations of the company. Corning does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations. As a result, the company is unable to provide guidance on a GAAP basis. See "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for details on core performance measures.  

Segment Results and Outlook 

Display Technologies: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

NOTE: In all segments except the Display Technologies segment, core net sales are consistent with GAAP net sales. Because a significant portion of revenues and costs in the Display Technologies segment are denominated in Japanese yen and Korean won respectively, this segment's net sales and costs are adjusted to remove the impact of translating yen and won into U.S. dollars. 

In the fourth quarter, Display Technologies reported strong results, with core sales of $904 million, consistent with a year ago, and core earnings of $276 million, up 18%. Full-year core sales were $3.6 billion, and core earnings were $1 billion.  

For full-year 2016, the percentage rate of growth in the LCD glass market and demand for Corning's glass was in the mid-single digits. Corning's sequential glass price declines remained moderate throughout 2016.

Page Three 

For full-year 2017, Corning expects the rate of growth in both retail market and glass demand to be in the mid-single digit percentages. In the first quarter of 2017, the company expects Corning's volume to increase by mid-teen percentage year over year, and decline by mid-single digit percentage sequentially. The company expects an overall favorable LCD glass price environment for the full year, with price declines more moderate than in 2016. 

 Optical Communications: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth-quarter 2016 sales in Optical Communications rose 11% and core earnings rose 85% over 2015. Sales growth of fiber-to-the-home solutions in North America, along with improved manufacturing performance, contributed to the higher year-over-year profitability. Full-year 2016 sales were $3 billion and core earnings were $297 million. 

In the first quarter of 2017, year-over-year Optical Communications sales growth is expected to be at least 25%. Full-year 2017 sales are expected to increase by a low-teens percentage over 2016. 

 Environmental Technologies: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In Environmental Technologies, fourth-quarter and full-year sales were down slightly year-over-year. Sales of light-duty substrates in both periods were strong, driven by global automotive demand, but demand for heavy-duty diesel products remained weak. Full-year 2016 sales were $1 billion and core earnings were $136 million.  

For the first quarter of 2017, year-over-year segment sales are expected to be consistent to down slightly. Full-year 2017 sales are expected to be consistent to up slightly from last year with continued strength in the automotive market and lower demand for heavy-duty diesel products. Sales of the company's new gas particulate filters are expected to begin during the second half of 2017.

Specialty Materials: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Specialty Materials fourth-quarter 2016 sales rose 22% over last year, led by record Gorilla Glass volume, while core earnings were up 48%. Full-year 2016 sales were $1.1 billion and core earnings were $189 million.  

In the first quarter of 2017, year-over-year segment sales growth is expected to be in the high-teen percentages. The company expects full-year 2017 segment sales to increase, with the rate of growth dependent on the timing and extent of customers deploying Gorilla Glass 5 and other Corning innovations. 

Life Sciences: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In Life Sciences, sales were up year over year for both fourth-quarter and full-year 2016, and core earnings growth outpaced that of sales. The Life Sciences segment is expected to have low-single-digit percentage sales growth for first-quarter and full-year 2017, ahead of forecasted market growth rates.

Presentation of Information in this News Release 

Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company's operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP financial measures assists in analyzing financial performance without the impact of items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. Detailed reconciliations outlining the differences between these non-GAAP measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on the company's website by going to the Investor Relations page and clicking "Financial Highlights" under the "Performance" tab. These reconciliations also accompany this news release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at core performance measures. We believe reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions. Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for the Japanese yen and South Korean won, and uses an internally derived yen-to-dollar management rate of ¥99 and won-to-dollar management rate of ₩1,100. 

Net sales, equity in earnings of affiliated companies and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the Japanese yen and the South Korean won, gains and losses on our foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings, acquisition-related costs, discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Management's discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items, as appropriate. These measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures. Corning does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen and South Korean won against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations. As a result, the company is unable to provide forward-looking information on a GAAP basis. 

Items which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at Core performance measures are as follows: 

  (1)   Constant-currency adjustments:   

    Constant-yen: Because a significant portion of Display Technologies segment revenues and manufacturing costs are denominated in Japanese yen, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings of translating yen into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-yen basis mitigates the translation impact of the Japanese yen, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts. As of January 1, 2015, we used an internally derived management rate of ¥99, which is closely aligned to our current yen portfolio of foreign currency hedges, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the Japanese yen.   

    Constant-won: Following the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials and because a significant portion of Corning Precision Materials' costs are denominated in Korean won, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings from translating won into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-won basis mitigates the translation impact of the Korean won, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts without the variability caused by the fluctuations caused by changes in the rate of this currency. We use an internally derived management rate of 1,100, which is consistent with historical prior period averages of the won.   

  (2)   Translated earnings contract loss (gain): We have excluded the impact of the gains and losses of our foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings for each period presented.   

  (3)   Acquisition-related costs: These expenses include intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs.   

  (4)   Discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: This represents the removal of discrete adjustments attributable to changes in tax law and changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, as well as other non-operational tax-related adjustments, including the tax effect of transfer pricing out-of-period adjustments in 2014 and 2015.   

  (5)   Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: Includes amounts related to the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) asbestos litigation, adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and other legal matters.   

  (6)   Restructuring, impairment and other charges: This amount includes restructuring, impairment and other charges, including goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and disposal costs not classified as restructuring expense.   

  (7)   Gain on realignment of equity investment: Gain recorded upon the completion of the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning.    

© 2017 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  

  (8)   Equity in earnings of affiliated companies: These adjustments relate to items which do not reflect expected on-going operating results of our affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges and settlements under "take-or-pay" contracts.   

  (9)   Impacts from the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials: Pre-acquisition gains and losses on previously held equity investment and other gains and losses related to the acquisition, including post-combination expenses, fair value adjustments to the indemnity asset related to contingent consideration and the impact of the withholding tax on a dividend from Samsung Corning Precision Materials.   

  (10)   Post-combination expenses: Post-combination expenses incurred as a result of an acquisition in the first quarter of 2015.   

  (11)   Pension mark-to-market adjustment: Defined benefit pension mark-to-market gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates.   

  (12)   Taiwan power outage: Impact of the power outage that temporarily halted production at our Tainan, Taiwan manufacturing location in the first half of 2016. The impact includes asset write-offs and charges for facility repairs, offset somewhat by partial reimbursement through our insurance program. We expect to receive the remainder of the insurance reimbursement in the fourth quarter of 2016.
