Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.  

On January 26, 2017, the Registrant issued a press release announcing a restructuring initiative implemented as part of its ongoing organizational review. This restructuring, approved by the Registrant’s Board of Directors on December 19, 2016, is intended to further integrate, streamline and optimize the Registrant’s operations by aligning certain Corporate and R&D functions with the Registrant’s recently restructured Generics and U.S. Branded Pharmaceutical business units, creating efficiencies and cost savings, a portion of which may be invested in the Registrant’s core and new products to drive future cash flow and earnings growth.  

As part of this restructuring, the Registrant will undertake certain cost reduction initiatives, including a reduction of approximately 90 positions of the Registrant’s workforce, primarily related to Corporate functions and Branded pharmaceutical R&D functions in Malvern, PA and Chestnut Ridge, NY, a streamlining of general and administrative expenses, an optimization of commercial spend and a refocusing of research and development efforts. The Registrant expects to incur cash charges of approximately $15 million to $20 million of employee separation and other benefit-related costs in connection with this restructuring. Substantially all of these cash payments are anticipated to be made by the end of 2017 and the Registrant anticipates that substantially all of the actions associated with this restructuring will be completed by the end of April 2017. Under this restructuring, separation costs are expensed over the requisite service period, if any, while retention costs are expensed ratably over the respective retention period.  

A copy of the Registrant’s January 26, 2017 press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
