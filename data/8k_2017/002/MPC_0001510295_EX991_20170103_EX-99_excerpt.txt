Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and DCF coverage are non-GAAP financial measures provided in this presentation. DCF coverage ratio is the ratio of distributable cash flow attributable to GP and LP unitholders to total GP and LP distributions declared. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP financial measures. The EBITDA forecasts for the planned dropdowns were determined on an EBITDA-only basis. Information related to the elements of net income, including tax and interest, and net cash provided by operating activities are not available and, therefore, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest GAAP financial measures have not been provided. Important Additional Information MPC, its directors and certain of its executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from MPC shareholders in connection with the matters to be considered at MPC’s 2017 Annual Meeting. MPC intends to file a proxy statement with the SEC in connection with any such solicitation of proxies from MPC shareholders. MPC shareholders are encouraged to read any such proxy statement and accompanying white proxy card when they become available as they will contain important information. Information regarding the ownership of MPC’s directors and executive officers in MPC shares, restricted shares and options is included in their SEC filings on Forms 3, 4 and 5. More detailed information regarding the identity of potential participants, and their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, will be set forth in the proxy statement and other materials to be filed with the SEC in connection with MPC’s 2017 Annual Meeting.

MPC Expects to Offer IDRs to MPLX in Exchange for MPLX LP Units in 2017 6  With the assistance of independent financial advisors, MPC completed its initial evaluation of strategic alternatives to highlight and capture the value of its general partner interests in MPLX while optimizing MPLX’s cost of capital  Strategy expected to include an exchange of MPC’s economic interests in the GP for newly issued MPLX LP units – Provides tangible valuation marker for MPC’s GP interests via publicly traded MPLX LP units – Exchanges GP/IDR cash flows for LP unit distributions – Expected to reduce MPLX’s cost of capital – Expected to enhance MPLX distribution growth – MPC would continue to retain control of the GP following this exchange  To be undertaken in conjunction with completion of dropdowns, with details of transaction to be announced following receipt of requisite approvals and tax clearance for all dropdowns (expected in 2017) 2 Note: All transactions subject to requisite approvals, market and other conditions, including tax and other regulatory clearances  

Strategic Actions To Enhance Shareholder Value Significant Cash to MPC for Return to Shareholders and Debt Paydown 7 1 2  Dropdown transactions will result in a substantial amount of cash to MPC at close; additional cash would be generated through ongoing distributions from MPLX – Dropdowns are expected to produce ~$4.5 billion of after-tax cash proceeds(1)(2) – ~$1.2 billion - $1.4 billion in initial annual distributions expected from MPLX to MPC after IDR exchange(3)  Cash proceeds from dropdowns and ongoing LP distributions expected to fund substantial ongoing return of capital to MPC shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining investment grade credit profiles at MPC and MPLX – The dropdown and IDR exchange transactions are achievable with pro forma MPLX net leverage ≤4.0x Note: All transactions subject to requisite approvals, market and other conditions, including tax and other regulatory clearances (1) Assumes ~$1.4 billion of EBITDA dropped to MPLX at 8.0x; financed 50% with debt (~5.0% interest rate) and 50% equity issued to MPC at current MPLX market price (2) Assumes 20% tax leakage on cash proceeds from dropdowns (3) Assumes MPLX acquires MPC’s GP/IDR interests valued between ~$9 billion and ~$12 billion based on a 15.0x - 20.0x multiple of PF GP/IDR distributions of ~$600 million with near-term DCF coverage expected to be above 1.1x. Also assumes GP/IDR Buy-In transaction 100% financed via an exchange of MPLX LP units at current MPLX market price  

 The combination of dropdowns and GP/IDR buy-in is anticipated to lower MPLX’s cost of capital going forward – Dropdowns enhance distribution growth – GP/IDR buy-in removes IDR burden and lowers equity cost of capital  The strategic actions are projected to provide DCF accretion and allow MPLX to achieve its double-digit distribution growth targets with near-term DCF coverage expected to be above 1.1x – MPLX will have the ability to further increase distributions if market conditions support such actions  The strategic actions will simplify the MPLX structure and fully align incentives with MPC – MPC will own the general partner and a majority of MPLX LP units, completely aligning interests towards continuing MPLX distribution growth and managing MPLX to be competitive and attractively valued  Addition of ~$1.4 billion of EBITDA adds substantial stable cash flow to MPLX and greater visibility to distribution growth Strategic Actions To Enhance Shareholder Value Significant Value to MPLX 1 2 8 Note: All transactions subject to requisite approvals, market and other conditions, including tax and other regulatory clearances  

1 2 Strategic Actions To Enhance Shareholder Value Total Midstream Value to MPC After Strategic Plan Note: Value per share amounts calculated based on an assumed 528 million outstanding MPC shares (1) Assumes ~$1.4 billion of EBITDA dropped to MPLX at ~7.0x - 9.0x; financed 50% with debt (~5.0% interest rate) and 50% equity issued to MPC at current MPLX market price (2) Assumes 20% tax leakage on cash proceeds from dropdowns (3) Assumes MPLX acquires MPC’s GP/IDR interests valued between ~$9 billion and ~$12 billion based on a 15.0x - 20.0x multiple of PF GP/IDR distributions of ~$600 million with near-term DCF coverage expected to be above 1.1x. Also assumes GP/IDR Buy-In transaction 100% financed via an exchange of MPLX LP units at current MPLX market price  After dropping assets and converting the IDRs to LP units, MPC would have ~$21 - 26 billion of midstream value held either in cash or publicly-traded MPLX LP units Category Description Value to MPC Gross Value / Share LP Interest  Market value of ~87 million MPLX LP units held by MPC today ~$3 billion ~$6 / share Dropdowns  Dropping midstream assets at ~7.0x - 9.0x annual EBITDA multiple, taking back additional LP units in MPLX and after-tax cash proceeds(1)(2) ~$9 - 11 billion ~$17 - 21 / share IDR / GP Interest  Converting the IDRs at 15.0x - 20.0x pro forma GP cash flows(3) ~$9 - 12 billion ~$17 - 23 / share Total Midstream Value to MPC Shareholders ~$21 - 26 billion ~$40 - 50 / share 9  

MPC Will Conduct Full and Thorough Review of Speedway  In keeping with MPC’s practice of evaluating shareholder value creation, an MPC Board special committee will conduct a full and thorough review of Speedway’s strategic and financial alternatives – Review to include a tax-free separation of Speedway to shareholders and other strategic and financial alternatives – Board special committee to lead review with the assistance of an independent financial advisor – Expect to provide an update on the review by mid-2017 3 10

Review to be led by a special committee of the Board with the assistance of an independent financial advisor. Update on review expected to be provided by mid-2017 MPC and MPLX Interests are Aligned – Increased and substantial MPLX LP holdings by MPC – greater than 50% pro forma for dropdowns and GP/IDR buy-in – Growing stable cash flows through continued investment in midstream infrastructure, driven by a steady stream of MPLX organic capex of $1.2 billion - $1.6 billion in 2017E – Increasing distributions to MPLX LP unit holders with forecasted growth of 12% - 15% in 2017 and double-digit growth in 2018 driven by organic growth capital and MPC dropdowns – Optimizing MPLX’s cost of capital enhances the partnership’s organic and M&A opportunities (1) Based on 3Q 2016 LTM EBITDA as compared to 2011 EBITDA (2) FACTSET as of December 30, 2016 11
