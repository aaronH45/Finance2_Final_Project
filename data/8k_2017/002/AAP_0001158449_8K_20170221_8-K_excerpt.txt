INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT 

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 

On February 21, 2017, Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release setting forth its financial results for its fourth quarter and fifty-two weeks ended December 31, 2016. This release includes forward looking statements including, but are not limited to, statements related to the Company's 2017 fiscal year. 

The Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and fifty-two weeks ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 include General Parts International, Inc. ("GPI") integration costs, store consolidation costs, support center restructuring expenses and amortization of GPI acquired intangible assets. As a result of these expenses, the Company’s financial results for these periods include certain non-operational expenses. Thus, the Company’s financial results have been presented in this press release on both a generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis and on an adjusted basis to exclude the integration costs, store consolidation costs, restructuring expenses and amortization recognized in the respective periods. The Company has provided the required reconciliations of the financial results reported on an adjusted basis to the most directly adjusted GAAP basis and has provided an explanation as to why the financial results presented on a non-GAAP basis are useful to investors.

The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
